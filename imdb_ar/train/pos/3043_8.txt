This film will tell you why Amitabh Bachchan is a man-made industry. This film will also tell you why Indian filmmakers are smart buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the height of his dominance of Bollywood when Araba, who once worked for Prakash Mehra, decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of selecting topics and building stories of them, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clich√©s to her. Saw a pig making the angry young man. Loris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was around the loyal servant serfs. <br /> <br /> But then the theme was to move the scenario through three hours of singing, dancing and drama. What the film consists of is a caricature of a Haryanavian who goes to Mumbai and becomes the hero of the organization. Saw the acoustic sound and Amitabh audio this film earns his big bucks, thanks to Haryanvi stock tone flawless. For me, this alone is the biggest drag in the film. The rest is a typical Bollywood screenplay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has so far had some typical comedy scenes in all his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film was a good dose of them. Captain of shoes at the concert, monologue on the considerations of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazar, the challenge of mosquitoes in the meeting room and the usual drunk scene has now become a standard fare for Amitabh. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added a record price. An extra mile from the film with his difficult temperament (reminding him to ask Ranjit "after a poisoned cake incident") was his most important role for the master while Amitabha was his faithful slave, but Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so on Shashi had to continue his work with the rest of the film, one of the characters that could have been further developed to make a serious film, but it's a big movie, remember ... As long as he stays that way, people came and saw Amitabha wearing a new hat and they went home happily. Always predictable, good people get the abaya and the go-go To the Jules, and the subject of old allegiance was once again confirmed, and everything is fine and ends well. <br /> <br /> So it is the hat that makes this classic film soon? Amitabh Bachchan in the name of Harianvi Prakash Mehra Another symbol of the story. Chuck story, characters and plot.
