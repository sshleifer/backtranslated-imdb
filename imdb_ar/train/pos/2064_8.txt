ScareCrow was one of the most poignant murderers I've ever seen in the film! Plus he bouncy most of the time he jumped in, which was fantastic! He also had an excellent voice and I mean it was perfect for him. The story lines were very excellent. I loved how the children's spirit was moved to ScareCrow which was wonderful! In addition to that he had a reason for all this killing I mean after what these people did with him ..... I will be angry too! ScareCrows appearance was good! His appearance gives this person "OMG!" Reaction when they see it! Which was fantastic the stars he got were funny! These people were stupid, and they stared for a long time! They should take a quick look at their lives and themselves ... although that will make no difference!
