The beautiful story of Stardust was written by Neil Gaiman (author of MirrorMask) and is a really good story. I think this would appeal to lovers of Labyrinth, Princess Bride or the 10th Kingdom Kingdom, yet it is unique and stand-alone. I feel that the adaptation of the film to this story has a much better end than that presented in the original novel by Neil Jimman. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristan in the novel), is the son of a deadly slave and just the jinn keeps him a witch in the world of jinn. The story begins in a town near a wall separating the magical world from the human world. When there is a star falling Tristan promises to retrieve a girl intrigued by. He is not aware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the imaginary world and that there are others after that as well. Three witches of the elderly who want to use her heart to become young again, some princes are bickering. <br /> <br /> It's a really good story. She has humor, magic, beauty, surreal scenes and pictures. It is charming and I feel it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a real classic fairy story, which I have not seen in film since the 1980s.
