This movie is very enjoyable and never boring even in about 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Viver and the rest of the actors are fantastic in the film and very believable. The violence was a bit severe in the film, but then showed how fierce the drug trade was at the time of the film. The spectacular ending is a probalby and one of the coolest sights ever seen. A wonderful movie and you may really enjoy it.
