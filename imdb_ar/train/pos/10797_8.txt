Carol is an author and elegant (beautifully played by the beautiful Rebecca Brook), her lovely husband Eddie (lovable David Houseman), an idiot Carol, constantly eating the best Gal Ana Ball (happily quoted with infectious comedic enthusiasm by adorable Chris Jordan), Anna Hankey, Emotional House (which is Eric Edwards is usually fine) is a quartet of liberating swingers who enjoy frequent sex with each other. Their normal routines are broken when Jennifer's mother Jennifer (a wonderful moving performance by Jennifer Wells) is on a visit. Very soon, Jennifer gets weary and becomes a willing participant in a full-bodied, unrestrained lifestyle, with everyone looking for Carroll to seduce her. The writer / director Joe Sarno gives a sharp and attractive examination of suburban activity and the restrictions on the entire sexual revolution of the 1970s; Sarno transforms the habits of the traditional middle class over their heads and adds more spices through a sub-plan of incest from mother / daughter. In addition, Sarno was elected as a first-class representative of the optimists: Welles and Brooke are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as a sex therapist in New Age, Shandara and Erica Eaton. fields. Better yet, all women are labyrinths and very attractive; the wells are particularly burst on the screen seriously with her wonderful personality and her exciting erotic presence. Sex scenes are really humorous and fairly straightforward, but never rude or boring. Steven Colwell has Steven Colwell's glossy, gold-colored cinematic film for powerful and effective money. Recommended for Sarno fans.
