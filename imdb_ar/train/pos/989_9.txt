My friend and I think this movie was good. We were expecting a lighthearted comedy but we got a full motion movie with comic orientations. We thought that this film might not have been very successful at the box office because previews make us think it was a comedy. I've been impressed by the supporting actors and of course Dave Morse is always doing great acting. Most of the cast are veterans and not the first time they were solid. We felt that both writing and direction were ranked first and we offered comments to each other about buying this film. If you do not buy hire them for a good period.
