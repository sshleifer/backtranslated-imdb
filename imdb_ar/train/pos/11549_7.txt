There's nothing you do not really like "The Odd Couple", and it's not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a winning team. But there is something largely backward about Neil Simone's adaptations of his theatrical plays, making him seem like a comedian in an initial comedy show rather than a full-length film. I have not seen the play, but I must assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, because Simon wrote it, so you can not blame these flaws on the adaptation from one stage to the next. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two newly-created men are directly involved in traditional married roles when they become roommates because nobody knows anything different - that Simon has never fully recovered. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
