Despite what others have said (coughing), this is my favorite film of all time. I do not know how long I was waiting to see him, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's strange, but it gives him an exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first Gackt and Hyde films. They did not do much at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at the beginning either. I think they are throwing some strange positions there, but I look forward to finding the best points in this film and the emotions offered and so on. So, I've made this movie and I always give it 10 out of 10.
