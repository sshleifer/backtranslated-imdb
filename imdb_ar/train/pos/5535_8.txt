The first picture of the film shows a mountain ridge in the fog of autumn in the early morning, and my idea is: "This is almost too beautiful." It goes like this: landscape pictures and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of which is perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This may seem old and has survived, but it suits the same story of silent beauty, which occurs on the border between life and the fairy tale, between Diane Fosse and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The sharp contrast of the film, which contains a simple and slow story, and only one actor and hardly any special effects, was a powerful charm. So I find it unfortunate that this rip-off was abandoned in the last minutes, when representatives were suddenly introduced (the girl as a woman, and her son). Another flaw is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring an English-language song with the glory of the French mountain. I went to the movie with my little daughter, but I recommend it to adults too, because they appreciate this kind of film. Obviously, not everyone does.
