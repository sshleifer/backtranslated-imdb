I have found this movie by mistake many years ago and I then asked (I still do) why I did not get the praise that should be. Well written, beautiful acting, twisting irony one after the other, there is ease in what trying to infamous characters. I do not recommend this movie to people whose attention span; requires enough intelligence to understand that there may be a kernel of truth in this story.
