As if most people did not already have a nervous look on the dental field, this little film will definitely make you sick with paranoia. A successful dental health professional sees his wife fall on a pond man (in memory of all her days!) And takes a lot of time in an angry breakdown. After shooting at the head of an immigrant dog, he walks around the work and ends up taking his doubles aggressions on patients and is planning what to do about his wife's "slut". There are lots of beautiful shots of laser capture, tongue-cut, beauty queen, as well as a superbly flawed performance by Corbin Bernsen. It is certainly difficult to see the scene in which his wife connects with gas and gazes him before swallowing her teeth mercilessly. A dentist is a completely wrong type that explodes at the end, and this film explains it in detail. "Dentist" is incredibly amusing, fast pace, and sometimes funny. check it out!
