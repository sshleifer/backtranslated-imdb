If in the 1990s you adapted a written book in the 1950s, the bloody thing was regulated in the 1950s and not in the 1990s. See, that the habits and values ​​of a 40 year old tend to not play well, or resonance as it is true, away. It's a simple rule that Hollywood keeps on a regular basis. This is the problem of this film. He was supposed to have been appointed in the era in which he wrote. You think that would be totally illogical, but not. I explain, but the bmacv comment illustrates that well. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. She looks like her diet is completely ass out of existence for this role. As a result, it looks like a crack in chemotherapy, which is just as exciting as a gay leather sofa in the clouds. I found her "I Can Die at Any Moment" that seems disturbing, and greatly detracts from her supposed "silence" and "sexual tension" that the film aims to produce. Otherwise, the film was good. 7+ out of 10.
