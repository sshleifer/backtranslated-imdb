Thanks to the clever text and steady hand of the writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a very exciting and exciting film. The film begins systematically and increases its strength when the clues begin to reveal that it appears to be nothing. Terry Garr and Hector Elezondo are fantastic, combining their efforts to uncover mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nick, of the films "The Tall Man". Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alex McArthur's tortured wife and character roles, played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Ann Ramsay and Estelle Harris, providing plenty of moments of light in time. There is even an inscription by Rex Lane. In general, I felt I was reading a good book next to the fire.
