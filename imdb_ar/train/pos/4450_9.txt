An old man who lives in the mountains awakes one morning and loses his cat. He wandered through the forest to witness a murder but saw the crime or was he losing his mind? Is it just getting old? The film is very cool because the viewer has to decide what is going on. There is little dialogue in this film, but it does not need words, and the whole film speaks for itself. You know what's going on and I loved it. <br /> <br /> The other part I liked was forest shots in late autumn and winter. It was beautiful but the only thing I did not like was seeing the old man in his underwear. He could tie his robe more tightly but otherwise, it was a very deep film.
