I would give this offer ten out of ten if it is not for farting jokes. You people are very sensitive, it is unnatural! Too fast to refer to the "racist" offer and jokes, but they are too fast to say ridiculous crap and pig heads like "Well, duh, some of these other shows do these jokes much better at least they have hot women." Abortion jokes are great because who takes the abortion seriously? At least I'm not the son * bear. I hear that Rebecca McCintry and Sarah Silverman are collaborating to make a film about the sisters on a road trip together. Talking about a movie of the year!
