Aim to the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that I wrote classic in it all. I have loved this series perfectly, and to this day, my favorite anime remains. Although not the first Gainax animation product, it was the first series of OVA games. It was a serious drama at the end of the second episode when Noriko Takaya was forced to ease the death of her father, who was killed in the first confrontation. For the human race with insects race, humanity is at war with it. Because of her father's death, Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But their lack of confidence proves that they sometimes stand in the way and falter. Her friend Kazumi Amano has doubts about Noriko's choice as a pilot. However, the Noriko coach, Koichiro Ota, trusts them. He made it his personal task to see that she managed to become a pilot, because he was one of the survivors of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung Freud, the Russian fighter pilot assigned to Squadron Noriko and Kazumi, who belong to Smith Torin, a lover of love for Noriko who was shot dead together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's participation is also important, as Noriko is in space, Kimiko is still on the ground to lead a normal life. Because of time-expanding acts, Kimiko usually lives on the ground while Noriko is relatively the same age when she leaves school. By the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old, while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent anime series to see if you are a giant robot lover Mika and Gainax animation. If you love other Hideaki Hideaki offers, or you're a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, give this chance a chance. It will grow on you.
