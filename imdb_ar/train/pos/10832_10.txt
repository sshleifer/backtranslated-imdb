If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this wonderful film with Steven Re in the main floor. The story revolves around the most famous rock group of the 1970s, exotic fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be a big problem during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch it.
