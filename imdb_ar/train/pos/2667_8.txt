I have never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap scams to intimidate their fans like loud noise and scary kids. They usually lack authenticity and contain an overpriced abundance. The only horror film I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was a good disposition, and it was a great story. But was joined by and perhaps surpassed by the film The Shining by Stanley Kubrick, and perhaps the most horrifying film ever. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family agree to watch a hotel while it is closed for winter. There were rumors of the place he was chasing, another man who was madly dead and his family killed. But Jack is convinced that he will be fine and can use calm to beat the block clerk. After months of isolation and silence, Jack became angry and violent later on. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that drives it crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most wonderful parts of the film is the sense of isolation caused by Kubrick. The hotel is very silent, the rooms are huge, but they are always empty. It is also frighteningly quiet when Jack's son rides his bike through the barren corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best performances, so he scares me of hell and takes care to come out once in a moment. My favorite scene is when talking to a ghost from inside a small refrigerator. <br /> <br /> The Shining is the top of horror movies in my opinion, overcoming the sinner like Ring and The Blair's charming project. You may be an enemy of the lizards, but it is definitely dear. 10/08
