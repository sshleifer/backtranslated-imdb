If you are in the right place at the right time. What a wonderful movie. It is easy to see why Chavez is so popular among his people. He does things. It's accessible. It is also easy to find out why the West so much detests. He has control over his own resources and returns profits to the people. Mostly poor. It is easy to see how television stations can photograph misleading images to put them there. Just like the Iraq war, or the war on terror. Or those missing weapons of mass destruction. Or what about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different views. The neoconservatives stop the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. Make your own mind. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: freedom of fascism. The American people are not the problem. It's the government.
