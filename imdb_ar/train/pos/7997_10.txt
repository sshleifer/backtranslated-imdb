This was by far one of the best movies and did not leave me disappointed at all. The sound track with the portable camera was superbly designed. There is always a possibility that the film will not hold their beliefs as well as other beliefs, but I felt that the rhythm of this picture and timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning quickly became a key element in the film, requiring a child with an old spiritual personality who never disappointed her because of her talent. For Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher and Allen, both transcend the challenge of showing the darkest aspects of humanity trying to move on.
