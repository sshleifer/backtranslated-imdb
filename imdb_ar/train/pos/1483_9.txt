A sophisticated contemporary tale about the pressures that work to ease and finally take off the marriage. The main thrust of the novel stems from the word "sermon" spoken by a rural priest after the wedding ceremonies of a global couple from Milan. In this way, the future path of marriage is clarified, which slightly relieves the pressures of modern life. The "moral story" of this story within the story is that for marriage to succeed, both now and in the past, this relationship has to be overcome by family and friends. This film was relatively popular according to local Italian standards. It is a shame that this movie is not available on any DVD or VHS.
