I really enjoyed this movie. Most ratings were bad, but most critics believe that the film should be like the idea of ​​drama. This film contains a little drama, but the rest is just a clean and very entertaining fun. Forget Julia Roberts Being a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a pretty young lady and there is so much more. Emma was very fun to see the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I think they'll go away. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan. I'm amazed Disney did not make this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and insults. It's a good family movie which is rare on this day. So take your family, watch this movie and judge yourself how good it is. I can not wait for a sequel.
