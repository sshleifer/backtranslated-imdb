It may be difficult for some people to access this site, where they are used to Hollywood production methods. The output is uninspiring, it seems just a depiction of the stage setup, the sound quality is bad here and there (stealing people's clothes sometimes competing with their voices, etc.) I and my friends started to watch without knowing what to expect, and the first scene caused our delay. He looked very tired and cowardly. After that, we chose the content tone, and we already started to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> It is very funny, despite some kindness. Definitely give it a chance if you appreciate a wonderful dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
