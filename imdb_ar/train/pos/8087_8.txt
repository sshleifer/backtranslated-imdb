There seem to be only two types of reviews of this movie on the net. Those who hate her and curse the name of Ralph Becksh and those who love her and call her the name of the rich. I tend to be in the middle. I have had to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (such as the harsh pieces of the story, the severely telescope viewers, the acting etc ...) However, I still love this film. Rotoscoping (when done correctly) adds a vibrant dimension to viewers, and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. Surrealistic scenes when the runners chase the elegant and well-executed Frodo and the musical result ... magical. Sadly bad points outweigh the weight of the film, but if you can bring yourself to ignore it, this is a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I will be killed by an angry group of people who hate this film after writing this film. Review, ah well, this is life)
