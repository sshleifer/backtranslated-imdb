I must say although I despise this kind of programs, shock horror, I am a girl, I feel I must express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I see Jackass and I think she outperformed the Jackass in terms of setting up the program. Story lines and overlapping interviews to create a more interesting presentation. I saw a few minutes from the movie Jackass the other night and I could not believe how bad it was, everything was put in a joke queue after the joke had nothing to do with anything. It must be the fastest display to amaze enthusiasts. While drinking worms is not a real thing, in terms of the big entertainment show, Dirty Sanchez is the way out of the Jackass League.
