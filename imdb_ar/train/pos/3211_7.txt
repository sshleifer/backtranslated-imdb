This movie is fine if you love the mindless work, the spastic representation, the plot is too small! The special effects are decent considering that this film is from the "Event Horizon" outlet. The fashion resembles something from Mad Max. No one speaks to soldiers, so others tell them what to do. It ends up with a big movie with explosions everywhere. Personally I love Russell better at "Tango and Criticism" "Escape from Los Angeles / New York" and "Executive Decision". You should see this movie leaving your mind at the door for a science fiction film that is not about it!
