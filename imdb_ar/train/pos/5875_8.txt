This is one of the movies that does not require any thinking or thinking, it's a very enjoyable time forgotten in the next hour or so. I am really surprised by John Abraham's behavior. He usually plays the role of gangsters like the character with the emotional face, so from this he plays the opposite and does it successfully, by being able to shine among comic geniuses such as Parish Rawal and Akshay Kumar. I was also surprised by the three Akshay girls because there are roles that do not require a lot of talent, but they often groan about the disappearance of Akshay (the other girls) and I was surprised because of their ability to establish an actual personality and you can distinguish between them. Something good, and the majority of songs are good, it's colorful and fun. On a dull Sunday evening this will surely ease your mood.
