Watching this movie has been a lot more fun in the cinema for a long time. However, I can not tell whether this is a good or bad film, because it can not apply such simple qualifications. This image contains anything that any movie can get. It features romantic comedy, political commentary, thriller, drama, action film, music and self-expression film. Everything there, add to the legend. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shajar (Sanjay Kapoor), who live happily in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husband's parents after a worrying news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves amid a conspiracy of sibling violence. At some point, the story is borrowed from "Not Without My Child", but to call Shakti again for anything would be wrong. <br /> <br /> The apparent storyline takes the back seat to a number of spectacular interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai coming as if from another film. In fact, the two stars on all posters, but they appear really late in the film, Shah Rukh only ends up being a real figure. However, it compensates for a very dynamic and truly unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor has the most work to do in this film, and she does an impressive job, where she has to tie the film rolls. And turns with a display of reasonable emotion. Another prominent presence is Nana Battikar, who plays Narasimha, the tyrant's father to Sheikhar. Nana Patikar dominates every scene that presents him with a frightening but precise personality. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its realism. Violence is rampant, but it is really annoying in the abuse of most female characters, with Karishma being severely beaten on a number of occasions. Sometimes, this violence is clearly disturbing, but it eventually becomes surreal, as each dramatic series is usually followed by such comical and spectacular roles, where the overall effect is nothing more than a risk. <br /> <br /> I've seen a share of Bollywood versions, mixing the kinds and making an incredible plot is definitely their rule. But Shakti raises the obstacle by absorbing a larger masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the greatness of the Shakespeare tragedy, where the crowd of rabble and kings enjoy equally. It is a pure and unwarranted cinema, and director Krishna Famsey must dream of a fun time by throwing every trick into the book. Perhaps the most important message of violence that breeds violence and the inspiring range of maternal love is the thoughts in my mind, but I came out of watching the delightful movie Shakti. Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
