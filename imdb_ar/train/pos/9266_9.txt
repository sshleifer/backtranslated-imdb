Ah, the best and most celebrated film about female football enthusiasts, a little better than the Epic Teenage Illusion of 1982 in North London (QV). By the way, I've only seen this in Movie 4 [2008-12-21] and I appreciate my inability to set PVR). <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite film for football after "Mike Bassett: England England", but this time with the added touch of being a guerrilla band from the industry team is clearly continuing to make banned films in The country in which they were made (think only of the place of the girls, taken from the playground as the sun sets: quick reactions in all respects). <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud, but when a rural soldier escorted one of the girls to the feces while forcing her to wear an inappropriate mask made of a poster for Ali Daei, I could not stop waking up at home with my firefighters. Especially when the young soldier misunderstood the calls of the grandfather for help ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of latrines, I only wish to speak Persian so I can put the writing on the walls of the toilets (yes, there were a few scribbles in the Roman font , But they often referred to exotic American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also, in rural areas - the Persian theme, do not you think that Omid Jalili looks like Yukel when he speaks Persian? Listen to the nursery sergeant in this film, then go to "Yup". <br /> <br /> I will not deal with Iranian sexual politics, nor will I deal with doubtful representation; my love for this film comes from script and editing: the most important things. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. Snapshot In Glory 5. Mystery Arsenal Stadium
