I can see why this film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film, where it was created brilliantly. So if you do not like Blues in particular (although that sounds more like jazz to me), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's simply well made, although I could not see life for me, so why did director Goyon Millie direct just one film - this movie. In other words, the film was nominated, but the director did not get any kind of career support. As for the black performers, they understood that their careers would not be turned to a high level, because most of the white community unfortunately is indifferent (or worse) to blacks or "this kind of music." <br /> <br /> If you are watching this movie, if you do not enjoy the previous section in particular, go to the 5:50 mark - where it rises dramatically. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved somewhat.
