Lillian Hellman, one of America's most famous playwrights, was an important woman. Her leftist views were not well appreciated at the time in the country. In her memoirs, she recalled her trip to the Soviet Union at the time, because she was fascinated by the so-called successes of that system. "Witness on the Rhine" must come as a result of those years. Left wing in America, where it faced a worldwide problem with the emergence of fascism, not only in Europe, but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a Broadway play eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In this, Mrs. Hillman was heralding America's entry into World War II. This amendment was credited to Ms. Helman and Dachel Hammet, her longtime companion. As directed by Herman Schumlin, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943. <br /> <br /> We have known the Mueller family when the film is screened. They cross the border to the United States from Mexico. They will have to continue towards Mrs. Muller's home in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farley, is a small hostess. We Mueller, realize that they are fleeing Europe because of persecution there against opponents of the totalitarian system developed in Germany. In fact, we thought, in a way, that Muller could have been better justified if they were Jews, fleeing the confirmed genocide. <br /> <br /> We have discovered that Mr. Mueller has had a difficult time in his life. Mother Earth, as well as elsewhere because of his frankness in denouncing Fascim. He only knows that he will come to the home of his mother-in-law, who lives in one of the worst foundations of that philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film offers an excellent representation everywhere. It's a curious piece because of the supportive role of Beth Davis. Paul Lucas, repeating his role on Broadway, is quite convincing like Kurt Mueller, the straight man who wants to create a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job of portraying Kurt Muller, repeating the role he made in Broadway. <br /> <br /> Another good performance is by Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farley, the photographer of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as a Marathi de Brancovis, a guest at Varellis, married to Teck de Brancovis, a sympathizer of Nazism, played by George Colores. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the Permanent Representatives offer good presentations guided by Mr. Schumlin. <br /> <br /> The film must be a reminder of the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.
