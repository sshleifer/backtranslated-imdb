It's hard to say sometimes why the film is so effective. From the moment I first encountered The Stone Boy, something told me it would be a great movie. However, it seemed unlikely that I had the opportunity to actually see it myself. Then, one day, while looking at the direct catalog of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased a DVD version of this film. This is what I am very happy with, because the cinematography is characterized by incredible depth and quality that the old VHS version can never copy. <br /> <br /> Speaking of cinematography, I have to isolate him away and top the most amazing aspect of this film. As a photographer who follows an almost visual technique in the film "The Stone Boy," I strongly believe that the great cinematographer can carry a single film almost alone. Here, he has a lot of help from a very talented crew, and the director fully understands what the story needs. But to make Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera makes every scene almost a thing of beauty. You can never say that. Most movies will not expect such a thing from you. The scene captures after the scene some details, a bit of visual magic that takes your breath. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Caen, has a long and interesting career. As far as I can collect, this film is not very representative of it. But, at times, to catch the director near the beginnings of his career, before all the huge budgets and loss of focus, there is real real charm can be found. Back step back in this movie, lets things happen with a life of its own, then beyond. Much like John Siles early films, the characters give space for breathing and time to talk. Side stories occur as they do, and this is life. Cain presents a remarkable and cruel understanding of the human nature of this film. <br /> <br /> Relationships affect much of this story together. When people talk, when they are present in this film, they do it as real people, and they are not hampered by the fact that they are playing characters. The Gina Berriault text allows talented and respected actors such as Wilford Primley, Robert Duval, Glenn Claus and Frederick Forest to simply spend time in existence. Whether the things they should say are simple or of profound importance, all this comes with the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved, or the wonderful sound of James Horner, it seems strange that this film is too forgotten. Perhaps much of what The Stone Boy did was the time it was made. There is a feeling of the remains of this seventies for this picture that reminds me of my childhood deeply. People talk about the 1980s in terms of modern styles and music, but that's not the 1980s I lived in or remembered. The appearance of the images, the quality of the dark representation and the low representation, and the total result must be under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. A film like The Stone Boy sees the world as true. <br /> <br /> For more of this feeling, please see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983) (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008), High Tide (1987)
