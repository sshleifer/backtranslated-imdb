The highlight of a massive black-and-white cinematography during the night, many of which, highlights this novel, which claims to be a reality from a Kansas murders in the 1950s that wiped out two men. Written by Truman Cabot, until you get the message of liberal punishment against execution at the end of the film, which is ridiculous to find out the facts of the case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the atheist losers who have misrepresented their view of life and who are killing this unnecessarily kind family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying tendency in the end, this is a thriving story from the start, and cinematography makes it even more exciting. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a great job in this area. It makes me wish to produce more modern black and white films. You can watch it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the supporting actors are excellent here. My third appearance of this film appeared in early April 2005, shortly after Blake's declaration, in real life, was innocent in the trial of his wife. One can only look at Blake and this film differently afterwards.
