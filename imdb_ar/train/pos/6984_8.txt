I have been re-imagined by Battlestar Galactica, a show that has always kept me guessing and made me cry on more than one occasion. A fan of science fiction, I would think I can pick good things from BS, and these things were good. <br /> <br /> As such, when I first heard about the possibility of a prequel series a few months ago, I felt like I was sick. I was afraid to reuse the formula that made Battlestar very successful at Caprica, which would not work at all. The story of BSG, about a group of sad sad survivors, trapped on the ships of decaying stars and guided by the Prophet's vision and the sequence of false miracles, was fully honored by exceptional music and better actors. Caprica feels different. When BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization at its cold and sloping peak. The view from Caprica was similar to that of the Minority Report, minus the exaggerated and unprofessional play. In the real form of BSG, Caprica in its early hours of programming has already addressed issues of religious freedom, racism, ethics of God's play and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The Casting for Caprica is also an excellent all-in-one unique and profound personality, from the obsessed and distant world that has turned into a businessman, to his troubled and intentional daughter, casting each representative and actress herself in their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music, so strongly used in BSG, also plays an important role in Caprica. The powerful Battlestar drums and sad waffle bombs worked very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, giving the exhibition a distinctly distinctive feel from any of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is certainly a special offer, as it is pulled from the Battlestar franchise as much as it needs. I look forward to the whole series.
