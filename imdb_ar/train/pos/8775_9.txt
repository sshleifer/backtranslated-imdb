Warner Bros excellent effort starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. He is often cited as the best he can, and I can not really judge fully until I see the "dawn patrol." However, his work in the film "Die with their shoes" takes some beatings. I'm a fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - and he also helps him as an Australian) and I think he's wonderful, and he has a great screen and a great actor too. He is the focus of "Gentleman C" as a legendary boxer with a fancy foot, but he is also supported by literacy texts, warm and funny, and the direction of Raul Walsh. Every Welsh film I have ever seen has never lost its rhythm, it was really a born filmmaker. Walsh directs the episode beautifully, as it does with the lightest moments, and the last touching scene between Wordpress and Flynn. In addition, the great production values ​​("Gay Nineties" have never been better!), Great support staff and a great entertainment. Alan Hill usually plays the role of Cork Sidekick, but here is his father, and everything is still working. Alexis Smith is in love with Cork. Couple on top of heels in love fighting with each other.
