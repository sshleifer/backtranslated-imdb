This movie is one of my favorites too. It's hard to explain why. Perhaps the innocence of Corinne Nemick and his embarrassment, coupled with the courage of Cheryl Pollack, but certainly has to do with the voice. Also, some characters have small lines or movements or amusing moments in their own right. Finally, the story always revolves in my heart, and the last scene is very sweet and bitter. All in all, I love this movie. It is perfect for spending a wonderful night on emotional girls.
