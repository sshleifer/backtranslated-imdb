It is always satisfactory when one of the bidders concludes the case and the offender is brought to the custody. In this case, the peak will give me greater pleasure. To see a smile smile wipe off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realized that her victim had left the "death bed certificate" that leaves no doubt in her guilt, she is very satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Please understand: While I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really, * really * bothers me. Are selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by practicing a simple "little girl" which is embarrassing for a woman of her age. Worse still, she now has established herself as a judge, jury, and punishment for her dead niece. <br /> <br /> When Colombo approaches, she tries to irritate her by manipulating him to make him out of the cuff. A speech to an audience of high-class ladies. He manages the tables perfectly by giving a warm and humane speech about the facts of policing. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Colombo from seeking justice. Abe's final appeal was rejected for his good nature because he has a lot of self-respect for not doing his job well. Here's one case you can not get out of Mrs. Mitchell!
