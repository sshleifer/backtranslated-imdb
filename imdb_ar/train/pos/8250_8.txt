This film happens in the 1950s. According to this, the deceased (called zombie) is made to eat the living. However, the company has developed a gasket, when placed around the zombie neck, making it deceptive and docile and perfect. Robinson Mum Helen (Carrie Anne Moss), Bill's father (Dylan Baker) and his son Timmy (Cason Ray) are being put into a coma because everyone in his group already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father dislikes him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things get worse. <br /> <br /> As you can see, there are - among many other things - a take on the Lacy series with Fido being standing in Lacey. His name was Timmy for some reason! Each of the famous Lassie rings is woven here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido for help before he eats zombie! It's also a satire of Douglas Cirque's 1950s movies where everything was bright and colorful - but dark secrets tear people apart. The characters wear VERY bright clothing in the fifties of the last century (moss always in the dress) - furnishings, settings and cars, all of them in the 1950s, are very bright colors. Even when the script becomes bis, there is always something to look at. The script is good - but there are plenty of Lassie jokes that you can do. Melodramatic is a kind of silly but dice pulls it. Everyone here is excellent and right in the target. Even Connolly as an emotional zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - play every line with all its worth --- but never go outside. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Spelling may be lost on most people and Jor is a beautiful tame. This is done incidentally and with happy music playing it is hard to take it seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. Give it 8.
