*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film produced by Rainer Werner Vasspender ever, and even with the wonderful script, the film is enhanced by the wonderful performance of Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria Schygulla and Klaus Lowitsch only for marriage as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped to the low days of the war and now Maria, her mother and sister must get rid of their survival. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that meets the needs of the US military and meets a black army soldier named Bill (Gregg Eagles) and begin to see each other on a consistent basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war until she became very serious with Bill. But one day when Bill became intimate, they saw Herman at the door. He did not die, and when he entered the room a quarrel broke out and Maria broke a bottle over Bill's head and died. Hermann is blamed and sentenced to long prison terms, so Maria told him she would succeed in something and get him out. The war is over and Germany must rebuild. One day on a train, Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Disney), a successful textile entrepreneur who uses her magic to get a job. Maria is determined to do a good job and climb the corporate ladder and become the mistress of Carl. She told him she would never marry him but he loved her. Hermann comes out of prison but goes to Canada to try to get over everything Maria has done since he was jailed. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Karl dies one day and leaves Maria almost everything he likes and Maria buys her own house. Herman then returns to his wife's house, both ready to start marriage, although they have been married for some time now. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and explodes the house as they continue to be there. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that it is one of those films that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. As in all Fassbinder movies, color is used in a very interesting way. When the film begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent war-torn Germany, but as Maria begins to succeed, she transforms into rich rich colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany is used with all the sounds of construction as a background only and the film remains focused on Maria's exploits. Fassbinder wanted to remind us of the sounds of reconstruction that were happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Chigula has never been and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With less actress, this was just another interesting film but Schygulla is so powerful that her performance elevated this film to an elite state. Chigola Maria appears to be very smart and determined, but at the same time uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty about it, and Vassbender wanted to show Maria as a woman who sells her soul practically to survive. Chigula was not nominated for the Academy Award but she has performed well and will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a street vendor and his mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard a lot of things about the end of the film, and it's about whether Maria deliberately left the gas. Later in the bathroom, the water was running over her wrist and she seemed sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was too excited to have Herman at home and leave her by accident (remember to wear a dress for no reason?). Then when her will is read at that point, she learns that Herman and Karl have become friendly without her knowledge, and I think she felt that all she did was for nothing. That is why the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes by accident. But I think the reason behind Fassbinder's existence is to show that anyone who sells his soul has no business life. Vassbender was fascinated by the survivors but was also incredibly enthusiastic. From his point of view, Maria can not get them in both directions. Wonderful movie.
