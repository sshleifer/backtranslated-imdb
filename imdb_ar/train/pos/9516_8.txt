Tom Hanks like you have never seen before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, The Angel of Death. He is a professional assassin to his father John John Rooney (Paul Newman), an elderly Irish gang leader. Sullivan's son, Tyler Hutchinson, witnesses what his father is doing for a living, and they both walk on the road for seven weeks stealing banks to avenge the death of Sullivan's wife and his other son. Good Lu entered as a reporter / photographer ready to kill Sullivan himself for a chance to add to his collection of pictures of dead gangsters. He was beautifully photographed portraying the drama of life in the 1930s. Sometimes the pace of speed falters, but then a wave of graphic violence continues to support the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama of allegiance, responsibility, betrayal and association between a secret man and his young son. Other notable members are Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Lee. Hanks once again proves to be excellent in a film very memorable. Make room for some Oscars!
