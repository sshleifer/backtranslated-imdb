For people of a certain age, W.W. The second was the time for their lives, and anything that followed them could never be compared. With the opening of the film, a widow is heard but still alive (Judy Dench) is a street musician trying to play the classic song Stardust. <br /> <br /> This reminds of her memories when she played in almost every girl band that enjoyed bomb raids during the war. The drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm) avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Denish meet and decide to reunite the band, which they take in a series of small adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band did not unite and re-emerge successfully. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully written and reduces its performance, with great performances from all participants. The characters are sophisticated and all the people who have not left their lives, despite their years. There are all those glorious old swinging music! <br /> <br /> This is not an argument for Steven Spielberg, but it is a dangerous film though. The war has affected everyone and this lesson has not been forgotten in a film that does not fear entertainment as it knows.
