George Lopez is a funny man even without a sitcom. The first episodes I saw often made jokes at the expense of his mother. As I watched this more, there was more and more variety. No one in the team is safe from his intelligence now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that as the season progresses, George becomes more comfortable with the role of the family sitcom. At first it was not, but it started getting more and more. This makes all of his performances gradually entertaining. They have added some characters to George to play outside this year as well. His father's father is involved in the plot more and more. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not so much as last seasons. I think it's wise to say George's sense of humor, ABC's lack of good comedy, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
