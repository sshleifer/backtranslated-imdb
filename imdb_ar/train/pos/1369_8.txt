I loved this movie, and I'm an older person who is not supposed to enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this film is not deep - who cares? These types of films are not. But strangely, there is a message in it. It is for each of us the ability to be what we want. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this film. I have always thought she had some similarity in the face of Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see that both Hepburn and Bossi have made films about the libraries (Hepburn's The Disc Set). All librarians, especially those who have a sense of humor, should watch Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I've been given this movie 8. It's not a great film according to film standards, although there are some great shots in it. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
