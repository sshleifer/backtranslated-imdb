I really enjoyed the sixties. Not from this generation (I'm waiting for the "80s") it was interesting to see a unique capsule for four hours of that era. <br /> <br /> However, one of the main problems in the film was the imbalance. The film was filming families. According to the promotional offers I saw on NBC, the story was mainly about two families with problems in America in the 1960s. Now, maybe I missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really think the 1960s use music to describe scenes better than any dialogue that can come out of the mouths of actors (and they are all very talented.) This is very clear at the end of the first part (about two hours in) of the mini-series. Very good movie!
