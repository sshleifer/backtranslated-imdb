The Invisible Ray is an excellent display of both Boris Karloff and Bella Lugosi's talents. Karlov proceeds from flawless performance as an arrogant and outspoken scientist who seems to have placed his scientific achievements at the forefront of his relations with others, even his wife. His only character becomes intolerable because he gets paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays the role of a leading professional, excited about his work but still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but seems to have nothing real. close friends. This was one of his few roles as a good man and he plays well. But it's hard to hear his tone and we think he's French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that it was all based on "unimportant science," but somehow, even unwanted science makes it work well. Since ideas and theories are completely stupid, they are "relevant" today as they were when the film was produced. It also goes forward and will always be so. <br /> <br /> This is a very delightful movie to watch again and again. I have probably seen it 5 times this weekend, and I can easily sit five more times. Wonderful acting and entertaining science. I strongly recommend it.
