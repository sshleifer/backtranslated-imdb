"The thing about my family" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film, directed by Raymond de Velletta and based on a play by one of his stars, Paul Reiser, proved that he had a great time in films. Although the film is predictable and know what the outcome will be, it is a discovery journey where Ben recognizes his father, and perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father as what he really is, not a mythical figure in his mind. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a way for a star, Peter Falk, to escape with the film, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most beloved actors who have worked in films in this period and in the past years, is a representative of such a place and must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, the distant father of Laban, he is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but has been shown by the entire family and his wife for forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Morel, the Kleinman's father, runs away, everyone is in a state of panic because this woman, who was a strong family figure, is necessary to keep everyone together. She does not know where she went, Sam appears in Ben's house confused because he feels abandoned, suddenly, by the woman he married and was faithful to all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a journey to find a house he wants to buy so he can get his family out of Manhattan. The trip provides a son's excuse for linking his father in ways he never knew because the old man always showed his younger son's personality. Along the way, the father and son realize how much they love each other and how old the old man misunderstand his children. Sam's love for Morrell extends over many years. They seem to be inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful in the film. He makes Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change to the worst. Mr. Falk is illuminated as the oldest man and there is never any wrong movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world collapses. <br /> <br /> Not a fan of Paul Reiser, we must admit that Ben Kleinman, he's right. Ben and his father discover how much they share and love Moriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukes is seen only at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a fugitive mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel in a great way .. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful appearance thanks to Dan Gilham's cinematography, and the excellent musical score by Steven Argella. In the end, the film shows a great collective effort between its director, Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it on screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film clearly targets the older audience, it should satisfy anyone.
