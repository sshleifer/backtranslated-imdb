It's a road movie, with a killer on board. Bryan Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated and respected writer, wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend Carrie (Michelle Forbes) have the money to tour the country for murder sites, so they announce a person sharing travel expenses. What follows is a young couple, Old Grays (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliette Lewis), better examples of the "poor white trash" that you will never find in all the movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's early and Adele that makes this movie so enjoyable, as they walk, wrestle, trust, influence, believe, grow, move and act in other ways I have not seen since the rerun of "The Beverly Hillbillies." An early idea for California: "People think faster there, because of all this warm weather; cold weather makes people stupid." This is enough to convince Adele: "I think that explains why there is so much stupidity here." Who responds with pride: "Certainly not." "You will never have to buy fruit, because everything is on the trees ... and they have no limits to speed, and I hear that the first month's rent is free, and the state law," Adele said of California. <br /> <br /> But the poor early, there are some mental problems, which became clearer to Bryan and Carrie as the four travelers west through the United States as they enter the desert in the southwest of the country, beautiful landscapes. , "Kalifornia" is beginning to appear more and more like "The Hitcher" (1986), and The Early begins to act more and more like John Ryder, the all-obsessed rider, whose terror seemed unstoppable. <br /> <br /> "California", representation is uneven. Duchovny flat performance. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, though sometimes overstated. Michelle Forbes is a wonderful artist of photography. But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and hard southern accent, it's amazing, Adele is very naive and cartoon-like. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie looks like a "twilight zone" as our passengers enter the Nevada nuclear testing site with an old, dilapidated house full of experimental displays. The plot is messily dissolving into unnecessary and useless violence, an end that has been rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> However, California is a general entertainment film, thanks to a clever concept and a wonderful scene, especially in the second half, good cinema, and great dialogue, and this is the great performance of Juliette Lewis.
