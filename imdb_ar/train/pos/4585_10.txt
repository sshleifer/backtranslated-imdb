This film is best for Jackie. I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts at all. I also love the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like the Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some of Jackie's other works, this movie also has a great story and was recommended by all Jackie's fans.
