Once I saw the tenant and interpreted it as a horror film. Many shields are used for this type: evil apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mystery, hallucinations. The hero's life, Trilkovsky, seemed surrounded by the evil and secret forces that were trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time you saw this, you challenged this initial explanation. If this movie is a horror film, it is just horror in the sense that Kafka's horror novel. In fact, this film can be understood on a literal level as a single man slowly becomes crazy without any external influence. <br /> <br /> In his career, Polanski made three films dealing with insanity: expulsion, which I do not particularly do, as the madness of the heroine never convinced me; Rosemary's child, in which the heroine overcame the forces of evil; Which may be the best study of the greatness of the cinema's grandeur. <br /> <br /> Trilkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman has been killed. He becomes obsessed with them and slowly begins to become with her: wearing her clothes and putting on make-up and talking like her. But does he have a spirit, or does he leave fantasy to benefit? This hesitation between what is real and imaginary, which Polanski never solved, is what makes this film great. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be for natural reasons, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to trust. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite film in Polanski yet, it is a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms. Technically, it's also great. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with film composer Philip Sard and the legendary director of photography Sven Nikvist (Bergman DP) in making this film. Slow speed and sometimes non-interesting parts may make it difficult to enjoy this movie, but it is an experience nonetheless.
