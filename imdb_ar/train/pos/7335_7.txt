With Ralph Beckshi, most of his films look like double-edged swords. You will get something fantastic from it but only if you encounter ridiculous and unnecessary. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of a story that may not always have been in the animation section. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a wonderful achievement from Bakshi from the point of view of animation. The rotoscoping is much more elaborate and the animation has a vibrant look to it. You can still get some boring static cells and the rear panels are a bit unclear but in general, the appearance has certainly become better since the last epic Bakshi fairy. Animation is almost natural in nature, and unlike LOTR, where this style was often at odds with the actual content, here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film failed to create a meaningful story from its simple setup. In fact, most of the characters' motivations are largely unclear. Lorn and Tigra are two easy situations but even the main villain Necron was hard to follow, let alone mention That Guy with the Furry face mask (also known as "That Guy" only). Although most of the vocal actors were suitable, there are some strange quirks in the sound section, and Tigra seems to look really awesome whenever they scream. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the entertainment value inherent in the film exceeds the unnecessary value of the ridiculous implementation of the plot line. Do not modify these amazing characters, but help remind yourself that this movie may not be meant to be taken seriously. It's still cool hi and really funny.
