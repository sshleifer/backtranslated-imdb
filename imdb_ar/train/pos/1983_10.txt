I recently saw this on the cable channel. The movie is awesome It's one of the few musicals I have seen that are not ashamed of light and darkness. Some depicts the splendor of the times along with a lot of squalor. Some of the dance sequences set piece happen a lot, I did not know where to look after it. Someday I'll go and see this on the big screen, so I see what's going on. But what brings this to another level is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. Not only does a man completely mean and threaten but there is something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him to the corner, he was able to do anything. It was as if the personality of Sykes was on the brink of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton Bill Sykes from the 1948 film, and I thought it was just a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance scared me in my living room.
