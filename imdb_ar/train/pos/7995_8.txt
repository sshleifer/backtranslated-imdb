Here is a revenge story of the bad guys who belong to Denzel Washington. He is three characters here: a former mercenary who is now drunk, then a former mercenary, then a lover of his mother to a little girl, then a wild obsession with the search for corrupt answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the appointment of Washington as a personal guard for a young American girl living in Mexico, where child kidnappings occur regularly (at least according to the film). Representative of our time, Dakota Fanning. When Vanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington pursues the responsible men and spares no one. Beware: This film is not hot. <br /> <br /> It is a good and bad film industry. I liked it, but a number of people found it very appetizing because of their taste because the work of the camera is one of the symptoms that can give you headaches. I thought it suited the tense story and it was wonderful to see it, but it (the shaky camera) is not for all tastes. <br /> <br /> Alongside the two stars, Christopher is always interesting, in an unusual way. Low role, and a number of other beautiful actors. <br /> <br /> The film tends to put the basic emotions in us all, but it works.
