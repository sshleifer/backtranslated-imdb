A warm, moving film with imagination-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn, as always, is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has made many great performances, but there will only be something chasing your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you have to see this amazing for 5 years. The old, Judyelle Fairland. I was very impressed with her presence and I had to buy the film so I could see it over and over again. It is a miracle of the creation of God. <br /> <br /> According to the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one to be fascinated by this young actress.
