I'm not sure under any circumstances the director of Visconti decided to shoot James Caen's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not sure if Viscounti got the rights to the book), but the resulting film is certainly interesting. It is not the best version of the Cain story (I like the 1981 version better), but thanks to the excellent Visconti direction and the casting of Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very exciting couple), it is essential for noir lovers. Visconti mixes new realism with influential Nuer sensibilities. The film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is too long for him; the story moves very slowly (I do not think Visconti was good at editing his films). I think the noir movie works best with a short runtime. Luckily, both Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep viewers interested. In any case, as much as I like this film and remake it, I think no one has made the final version of the well-known book Cayenne.
