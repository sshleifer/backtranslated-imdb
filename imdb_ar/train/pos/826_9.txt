I'm fed up with people who complain about Ewoks! True, they are not the best that happened in Star Wars, but they happened, so deal with it! Moreover, they are nice, and I do not care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me to cry. she's perfect. The end can not be better. I am excited about the danger of Phantoms because it will suddenly focus the whole story axis from Luke to Anakin. I like the way it was finally revealed - it will not be solved in any other way. Even those who suspect that the Vader helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, was finally revealed as a sick-looking man. It is not entirely in the machine - it is weak. <br /> <br /> I do not know how it happened that the acting director brought out these good actors in "New Hope". They all do well. They are reasonable personalities. Hamel does an excellent job with the development of his erotic personality. Fisher does a good job as a female model (meaning, come on! Jaba was killed even when many others failed!). Harrison Ford - I Need To Say More? <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic again. It is very moving and important when you can choose character traits in different parts of the film. Best climax when yelling Locke "NOOO!" Jumps to fight his father in the final battle. John Williams is no less than a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Already, the film has much more meaning to me because of the first episode. I can not wait to see him finally in the theaters (can I wait ???) and then watch the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
