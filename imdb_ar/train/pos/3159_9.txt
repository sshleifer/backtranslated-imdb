... The series lets you forget about it all. I am three years older than the children who were filmed in the series. Born in 1958, she learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got her first job out of college during the second gas shortage in 1979. The seventies were a really scary time to be young - inflation, and compete for the minimum after school paid work with thirty Awesome play and music and worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of it and still can make the seventies look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. He is able to look directly at the 1970s - complete with authentic clothes - yet the show fills with the hope of young people and things that make high school and college years the best and worst times. Then there are parents. The little lovers at the show - Eric Foreman and Donna Pinkoute - have good parents who have the best intentions. Eric's parents, Reid and Kitty, are not exactly in June Ward, although they are traditional over the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s reached the suburbs in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who are waiting for the sixties of the last century to show their whole lives in order to give legitimacy to strangeness. The friends of Fez, Kelso and Jackie of the Eric team took out a group that represented nervousness, incompetence and good faith respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show around the suburbs, but he represents largely someone who is forced to play cards that have been distributed even when these cards are handled by absentee and careless parents. I would recommend all eight seasons despite a little late eighth season due to Eric's absence.
