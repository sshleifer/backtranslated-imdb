This film was on my wish list for 10 years and I only recently found it on a DVD when I got my partner's grandson. He was happy to learn that it was my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and wanted to know more about him - and me. Luckily, I borrowed from him and saw him alone and cried through him. Not only the emotions and class discrimination, the difficulty and warmth of human relations in those years (as well as the harshness (spoken and undeclared), but it was accurate! ARP uniforms and ambulances (LCC) I could not fault anything from my memory, the sandbags restored Anderson's shelter and WVS's goals, and the difference between a relatively uncontaminated life in the war-torn village and London was vividly demonstrated and I live again 1939/1940 and my London of this production! Of course, Gold's work will not expect him more than this detail But beyond the mere representation of the facts and touching the deep ropes about human responses and the only half-spoken value judgments of those years.Certa was in one of John Tho's greatest positions in acting and direction of gold and deserved to be better known. Two copies to send to friends.
