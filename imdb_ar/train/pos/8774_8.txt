In the late 19th century in San Francisco, well-designed Erol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) works in a bank and enjoys local "fights" (with boxing) with a co-worker and drinking friend Jack Carson (Walter Lowry). One day, Alexis Smith (like Victoria Ware) enters the Comstock Bank, where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is taken with the grace of the elegant Mrs. Smith, who offers to carry a pull purse. Smith is secretly taken with the handsome Flynn, but postponed because of his struggle. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good work (in fact, trying to pick up) gets a free membership in the impressive Olympic Club, which includes sports fields (with boxing equipment). However, the supposed Flynn method, the practical joke (tickles men on parallel bars) disturbs members of the "club". When the English boxing club visits the club, members seek to get Cork to fight the man. They hope that Flynn will resign humiliatingly defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer, Robert Rubner, has assembled an impressive collection of Warner Brothers products and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was certainly succeeding in the success of his screenplay in the wonderful studio "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is ridiculously positive. There was a "handsome guy" - this is supposed to be the real autobiography of James Corbett, "The Roar of the Crowd" - but it must be a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leading man. He maneuvered the text gently and should have been recognized, in the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's descriptions have been overlooked as fantastic shows, and this is one of them. Smith works well with his female interests, skillfully conveying her feelings to the viewer. Director Walsh makes the kindness look smooth and expensive. The cast is a treasure, from a bustling Alan Hill (as Corbett has) to a walk on Color Macalister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raul Walsh - Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hill
