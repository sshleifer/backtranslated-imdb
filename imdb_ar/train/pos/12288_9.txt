The House of the Spirits is a story sweeping family intrigues and politics in South America and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende to life with all her passion and suspense. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons plays Esteban Tropa at ages and is very reasonably designed, while Merrill Streep keeps Clara's warm and loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Rider and Antonio Banderas make a husband and a friend who struggles to accept the family in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, performs very impressively. Portuguese countryside is a reasonable alternative to a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings of the Clara House and the Esteban Farm are effective, adding the period of American cars to the postwar atmosphere.
