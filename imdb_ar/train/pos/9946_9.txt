Dream Quest was an amazingly good film. There was some notable idiot, but it can be expected in a film like this which was created in such a short time. I felt no desire to move forward during the film and found it very enjoyable. It gets kind of silly sometimes, but overall I highly recommend it. They probably used all the luster in nearby stores, and some of the fashion designs were very good.
