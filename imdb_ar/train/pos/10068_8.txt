This film was excellent. A sad fact is how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one mysterious warm kind of movie. You have a master who is steeped in a sweethearted tradition in his own way, Doji despite being a girl for his passions and you are at the forefront with a cute monkey with one thousand facial expressions. This is worth in a big happy movie in the end. This film plays a good role in showing the extent to which one is immersed in tradition, so overwhelmed that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see aspects of an unprecedented culture by helping to reinforce the drama unfolding near the end of the picture. Excellent cinematography, especially the sequence of the opening procession with all the sparks. Bound to be in the Oscar competition for the best foreign film.
