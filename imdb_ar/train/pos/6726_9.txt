Again Stacy Peralta is the real first to people who have lived the story. By leaving the participants in the great surfboard telling us how they felt and what they thought, I felt there. The film takes you from the 1950s to the present time by focusing on three of the main architects who contribute to the development and development of sport. An explicit "home movie" like their videos and their contemporaries takes you to their world. You will get full layers of this side of the surf from the music layers, the culture, the technical information, the exclusive perspective of the sportsman involved, and the great wave pictures. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
