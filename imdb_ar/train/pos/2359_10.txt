I think if you have to ask most JW if they expect miraculous treatment because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises made by Christ from the resurrection. Therefore, even if the worst has happened and dies while we hold our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct this. <br /> <br /> It really is a simple question: Is God real to you or? Is this all just believing? If it is real, and you trust it, you will follow its guidelines regardless of the short term outcome. <br /> <br /> You've had a heart attack for about a year and a half. One of my family members was horrified when she saw the words "no blood" written in large letters on my chart. I thought with her that if I was in a position to just move blood to save my life, would this be a good time for anger, where the only person could bring me back to life when the time came? You did not understand that - God is not real enough. so sad. I hope you get the comfort that faith gives you.
