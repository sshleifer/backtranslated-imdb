If there are more than charming representatives of Peter Austenov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more magical film in 1968, I do not know who Kana was. I first saw these delightful little gemstones 25 years ago when I was 16 years old, and I consider what year I failed to sit down to see it again. She is clever, crooked, elegant, sad, sweet, subversive, very charming. The romance between these two socially inappropriate characters is a rich and terribly moving comedy - no more than ever in a desperate attempt by Maggie Smith to bring the appropriate card to the deck, a wonderfully funny scene and an ideal miniaturized image of the tragic unit. This final frame of the freeze on the face of Ostinov anxiety and anxiety and a lover is asking, "Are you okay?" - Has anyone ever made the appearance and voice of dedication so frank and perfect? I never want to know anyone who does not like this movie.
