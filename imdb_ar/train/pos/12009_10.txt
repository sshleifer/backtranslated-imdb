I really thought they did an excellent job *, there was absolutely no error at all, I do not know how the first commentator could say that it was terrible, it made me cry (I think it went to everyone crying) but I try not to cry in the film because It was embarrassing but this brought me. It was a good SOOO! I hope they will release on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel that he renews my faith and gives me hope that I can not explain it. He made me want to be a better person. They have gone through a lot, and we kind of take it for granted, I think. Compared to that, I feel that our own experiences are not something. Well, nothing, but they barely match what they were forced to do. loved it. Who played Emma ?!
