Anyone should be complaining about how this film was nonsense or that it was not a conspiracy looking for "Jean de Florette". Hi! This film was made to be a random comedy act and does not include any form of plot in any form or form. I would also like to mention these people who go to it if you will be scattered on this film which seems to be lacking to this point. This film is clearly designed for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor" that just seems to me a pile of crap crap. The basic point is that everyone has their own opinion and should be a bit more appreciative than that some people may not be in tune with your sense of humor before shooting. <br /> <br /> Thanks
