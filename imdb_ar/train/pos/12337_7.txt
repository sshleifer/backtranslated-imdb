Poor Ivy: Despite the way she was born, she had bad luck in marrying a charming crap (Richard Nye). When the film was shown in the 1920s and 1930s, when the rigid Victorian ideas of the classroom faded at the edges, this uncertain situation unnerved them. Gretorexes (so called) do not know where their next shark comes from but there are yacht parties and fancy dress balls with a luxurious scent to seduce. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) introduces an older rich man (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born in middle age), she puts one of her extra openings. Fortunately, one of the lovers who is still working along (Patrick Knowles) is a doctor whose consulting rooms provide a cache of toxins, and she makes a miserable farewell. The fact that it involves the Knolls involvement does not slightly scale, even over time until it is suspended until the neck. The plot's transformation depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwick. Nolas' mother (Lucille Watson doubtful); and the governess of Knowles Pro (Ona O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some nice touches to this much higher than the middle melodrama; the luminous Fontaine face extends the rest.
