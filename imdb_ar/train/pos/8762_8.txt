"What would you do?" Is the question that will remain in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional Brocadeon Palace. You will also be left wondering whether Alice (the Danes) is telling the truth or not - an issue left unresolved, and rightly so. This is a very good visualization film very well. Although it is sometimes slow, its speed reflects the story line - but much of the film will make you at the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. The end will also let you imagine yourself in the shoes of eminent personalities, skillfully played by Kate Beckinsell and Claire Danis. Bill Pullman's performance is also commendable.
