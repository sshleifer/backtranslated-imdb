This is just as good as the original 101 if not the best. Of course, Crowela steals the show with its horrific behavior and races, and the film may have been produced because the audience wanted to see more of Crowela. We see a lot of them this time around. Ioan also likes Gruffudd as Kevin, the male lead fairly trifle. The use of Paris as the climax of the film was a smart idea. The movie is worth watching no matter how old you are, provided you love animals.
