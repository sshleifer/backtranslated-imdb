A classic series must be repeated at least or released on DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that he was adopted after the death of his parents, embark on a journey to find his true parents. After the various rites of passage, his quest culminated in the discovery that the identity of his fathers was stolen and used as a human escape in Europe! If I remember correctly, the serial ends on the Austrian ski slopes and the airport of a rock slope killing the parents of Belize. He was filmed in a location in various destinations around Europe and looked incredibly polished and well with some episodes that traced to the nuer movie worlds and criminal excitement. Often the main arch was broken by the slits of life that Billy had spent during his hard work years finding his family, his mother and his fathers.
