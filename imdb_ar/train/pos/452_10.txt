"My child, my sister, I dream <br /> <br /> To what extent all things look sweet! <br /> <br /> We were in this pleasant land to live together, <br /> <br /> There is a slow love And long, <br /> <br /> there is love and death between those scenes you see, that lavish weather. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth von Arnhem, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence? This is done in the early 1920s when four women from London, four strangers decided to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. This is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - the final film "Feel Good" is the perfect of its kind. It is beautiful and sunny, thin and calm, gentle and charming, it is like the sunshine on your face during the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of quiet happiness and cherish it forever. This is a film that has already affected my life. I saw this during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and reach some incomprehensible facts about myself. This helped me regain my optimism and hope that anything and anything could be changed. I promised myself then that no matter what, I would get myself out of misery and pity for myself, and I would be grateful every minute of life - with joy and sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did it and I was not alone . <br /> <br /> Charming, enchanting, and intimate, "Enchanted April" is one of the best films ever made and my eternal love. This small film is a diamond of the highest quality.
