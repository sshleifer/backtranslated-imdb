Arrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life very seriously !!! Watch this movie to find out what it is, sit down and relax and get a giggle. The film does not take itself very seriously, so we should not. If you like James Belushi, you will like this movie. If it is not your cup of tea - give it a miss. <br /> <br /> I love James Belushi, so I loved this movie. That's just not it? :-)
