Level I, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie at the age of 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. I did. Surprisingly, as I remember, the sound caused by seeing the beast is what caused them. <br /> <br /> Level II, Theory of Psychoanalysis. <br /> <br /> Later, as an adult, I saw the story of what it was: what if the unbridled wild instincts we suppress all become clear. <br /> <br /> Level III, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to reasonably perceive a "what if" plot is through this type of science fiction. This is pure science fiction, not "cowboy in space" that extends to this genre today. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet is still the greatest science fiction film. If you are planning to remodel, SKG or Lucas, watch out!
