Clark Gabell plays the role of a man who concedes the life of Mrs. Jane Harlow. He tries to suck her while she dumps her hard position. Despite the irony and negativity fall in love. When Jable kills a man by mistake, he runs out and leaves Harlow loyal to the women's prison where she discovers she is pregnant. The writings of Anita Los and Howard Emmet Rogers are excellent all the time with many well-known and surprising characters (including the Jewish Social Descent and the Black Prison, her promising father barely playing through the stereotype). Gable and Harlow show them as actors who add the nuances and quirks of their characters that send them beyond the roles of Gable and Harlow. The trend is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. One of the beautiful shots Harlow was put in jail, then led to an amazing snowy courtyard where the camera is being tracked. This is one of the best types of "criminals in love" and "women's prison" and has some of the best hard boiled dialogue ever written.
