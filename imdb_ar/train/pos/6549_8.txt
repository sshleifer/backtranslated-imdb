Taking a collection of old stories is a challenge for the production team, and how to update this classic character and make it fun enough to capture a new audience with memories of its former audience. In my opinion, their mission has been accomplished. You should see young children, pre-teens, teenagers, and their parents. Well, there are scary moments have been solved in a short time, but parents who have small children should sit tight, the film moves to better things. I will go with those reviewers who are talented users who have pointed out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive model for young women, not drink too. Nancy works to balance her femininity and her irritating thinking skills. There is so much that you like here, laughs, does not take himself seriously, it's a real puzzle that needs to be solved (one you can discover as an extra bonus, and a loved one.) So Nancy Drew makes a good movie in my opinion.
