This one movie will take some time to get out of your head as soon as you watch it. The dialog boxes are close to perfect, which was expected to be adapted from the play. Actors simply offer their best, simple and attractive story. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal has full credibility in his role, and Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) that offers the greatest pleasure to the eyes like her ears, Jean- Paul Rouve offers an excellent overall Being so), and Marina Fois is a stupid friend who always misses when you expect it at least. <br /> <br /> Even Bernard Rapp is excellent and partners to adapt to this excellent play, and all the success of future productions! <br /> <br /> I hope there will be more of these in production these days. If you like it, you'll probably enjoy "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependencies". Both books were played by the couple Bakri / Jawi.
