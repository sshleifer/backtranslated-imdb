The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Secrets waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal stories about personalities! Just explain enough to stay excited! Of course this show has some drawbacks! In the first and second series, there are some characters that do not show up for some reason in the third season for some reason! Many characters have a decent package but some are just not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where have they gone to heaven? What happened to them? Maybe they will come back in later episodes! But it is a bit inconsistent! That said "lost" managed to be exciting in every episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is a very difficult thing to do! I note that in the third season, the focus is on personal development rather than the ambiguities of the exhibition! This is not a bad thing! So it provides some episodes of getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the power of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end, I want to see some puzzles that must be solved and get closed! Risk of "lost" getting canceled due to low ratings nearby! It will be devastating!
