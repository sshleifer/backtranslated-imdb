My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" from a random stack of movies on our weekly trip to the horror department - none of us heard about it, but the noise in the box was really promising. The film did not disappoint, although I still would not call it a horror film exclusively. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden paints a house and visits it in her dreams. She is definitely asleep when she sees the house, but it is fairly real to the point that it is a completely separate fact. Which, in the light of subsequent events, do not seem far from the truth. However, you find that they can add to the home, its contents and its surroundings by simply adding it to the image. <br /> <br /> While this is happening, Anna is increasingly suffering from fever, as well as being completely obsessed with the home and drawing it. Moreover, she and her mother deal with her absent father; he has a long-distance job, although one has the impression that the story is actually more than that. <br /> <br /> Well, so the drawing elements seem nice enough - but honestly there is something really threatening about it. Dreamworld is surreally scary - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of an abandoned field. The people who made the film did a great job by making us very uncomfortable with this universal / continuous dream ... <br /> <br /> One of the things I add to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient that his doctor continues to talk about ( I do not give it away, as you know from the moment it shows up as the child himself. In fact, Mark can not walk because of a disease; in the graphic world of Anna, he can not walk because she has not drawn any legs. She blames herself for her real illness, tries to correct the situation, but ... everything begins to become really strange. She brought her absent father to the drawing, and had disastrous consequences. The bits with the father are really terrifying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything away, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot going on in this film. I'm sure you'll have a ball you analyze this thing to do with your friends after watching it - is it a simple story as it looks, or are there layers of meaning? I do not know, but in both cases it was very cool. There was a "Nightmare on Elm Street" - high quality about it, in fact at this point intersect dreams. I like things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it seems like it has ended several times, but it did not. I am satisfied with the end they contain (you may want some sensitive species you have to use Kleenex!), Although it may already have a variety of conclusions. However, you do not feel fully withdrawn once it is actually done, but as you watch and continue to fade, it is still irritating. <br /> <br /> However, "Paperhouse" is really a good film. It has been well done, and represents Charlotte Burke in the role of I - First Class. Burke, who has never appeared before or since in the film, is a real gem. I do not know why you did not go on doing anything else, but in both cases it was really compelling and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not a horror movie, it is a kind of fantasy / suspense / other kind of film, with certain moments of horror - but you can still watch it with your family and do not worry that your little brother or grandmother You will get a profit from the blood or anything. <br /> <br /> Give her a chance, you will not regret it! Maybe you should read the book, too ...
