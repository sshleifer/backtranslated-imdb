Peter Falk is a diverse and distinguished actor. The film is well written and the acting looks like a real life. For all the lovers of Colombo this is the superior work. It shows what the talent of Peter Falk is. He does not play Detective plays retired carpet seller. By the time credits start in the role you really want to see again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will apply to everyone who watches it; the depth of their suitability will be the only thing that varies. It is shameful that liberals in Hollywood are only promoting stink and skin because this is the kind of film that people should be proud of in this area. This will be a great film that turns into a direct theatrical performance.
