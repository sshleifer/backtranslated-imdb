I thought the guard would be a modest film. When I finally saw him, I took a good surprise. The movie is not a great thing but it's very fun and action scenes are very good. This movie reminded me of a television series such as 24 or Alias.It is very similar to this series, and reminded me also, of the movie Wolfgang Petersen in the line of fire. If you expect one of the most exciting movies in the world. History of films, you will be disappointed. But if you go with a little expectation, you will enjoy the guard. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
