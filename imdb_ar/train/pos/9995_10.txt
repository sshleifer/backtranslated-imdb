This is the kind of movie you want to watch with a glass of wine, and fire, with your feet up. It does not take much mental power to follow, so it is very good after a long day. I would say that it is very unrealistic - if you expect anything serious, do not worry, but it is very funny. Just think that a businessman will go to the point of agreeing to live in a slum for a while, then actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
