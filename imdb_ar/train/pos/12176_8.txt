Paul (Jason Lee) is a losing agent who happens to be involved in a princess of type A called Karen (Selma Blair). She chose his clothes and his daily schedule. At the bachelor's party, Paul became very drunk and somehow ended up taking a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Steeles) to the excavations. "Nothing happened," they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. It is understood that Paul bothers Becky out of place, although her underwear is left behind. But, there is more fun in the future. At a family dinner in the home of Karen's parents, Paul attacks Becky again, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talking about some explanation to do! Instead, Paul chose to pretend to have a stomach problem and hide it in the bathroom. Did Karen discover that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? What will the consequences be? I'm sorry for critics who like movies like this. They should definitely relax, because this movie is new and enjoyable. Of course, it does not hurt that I have a funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is natural as a beautiful preacher but an anal. The remaining actors, including James Brolin and Julie Hagriti, are also very nice. The appearance of the film is superb, as are the fashion settings of California. The best thing is that the script is creative and inspirational, and creates great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to laugh funny proverbs, get this movie tonight. Oscar material may not be guaranteed to turn a bad day into a good day.
