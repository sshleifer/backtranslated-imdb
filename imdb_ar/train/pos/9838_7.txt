Born again is a fine episode of the first season. The reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is wonderful. The more I saw him, the more I liked him, but he would not rise above "very good" for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as a reincarnation ring. Anyway, now I'll say what's good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yes! <br /> <br /> The fish tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Sent out of the window. Very stylish. S] <br /> <br /> Bad: marry your best friend wife !? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> Why did not the man who died because of the tangle of his scarf intertwine, tried to remove his scarf instead? > <br /> Conclusion: Well, do not forget too. 10/07
