This could be the most disrespectful film of this kind. I do not remember seeing any ads or commercials for this ad that might have been the reason why they did not succeed at the box office. However, Frailty is a truly awesome and original horror film. You have rated it in the top 10 favorite horror movies on my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with clips of photos and news articles telling us about a murderer who calls himself "the hand of God." Then a man enters a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a place where the victims are buried, which could help resolve the issue. During that journey, the man begins to tell the story of his brother and come back in time when the events begin. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their religious and religious father, who one day claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill devils who appear to be ordinary human beings. Receives from God a list of demons that will be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary and disgusting movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Tension mounts, kills innocents (or demons?) And religious experiments are questioned. It only has a few smart twists in the end. If you like this kind, I highly recommend Frailty to you. I own the DVD and it is one of my favorite horror movies all the time.
