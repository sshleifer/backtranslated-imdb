I watched this movie originally years ago during the Cinemax Friday after a dark series (again when a cable box was created like a keyboard), and it aroused my interest. Although there is a meaningless side to the film, it was well conceived. Depardieu & Dewaere's performance is very good. They both have good chemistry together, and Miou-Miou makes a wonderful pink escape. In these politically correct times (at least not in the United States), they seem to raise things like violence, theft and casual sex. This film proves that through a talented and talented crew in directing a good film, it is a good film regardless of the subject. It saddens me to discover that Patrick DeWere has committed suicide and in the near future, I will check him out with Depardieu & Miou. -Miou out of your Hankerchief.
