The first word that comes to mind after watching this film is "Beauty". Beauty is everywhere, in the actors' play (Andy is fabulous as always), in well-designed clips, and in the red line idea of ​​authors - love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's personality is the only white character spot in this three woman's "boring and unpredictable life." His interaction makes Andy's character live as entertaining as possible.When he left, it became clear that we could not really appreciate And we hold on to our inner beliefs and desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andy is successfully recovering from this loss is not bad, it shows that life prevails in any form, even in this small British village, which is ideally displayed. <br /> <br /> Another reason I like this movie is that it is British in all respects - all these houses, "signs" and accents :)) Rh other is doing a great job! It is a shame to have this film low marks. 10 out of ten!
