It could have been a better film. It turns into points, and the central story moves from Boer to complete his mission to Boyer avenging the death of Wanda Hendrix, but Graham Green is an author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all moral tales, given his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (the most relative terms in his worldview), and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boer is Luis Denard, a well known pianist, who stood with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to try to execute the much-needed arms purchase. Unfortunately for Denard, he is literally alone - each of his contacts turns into a ready-made player for the peasants in Spain. In particular Katerina Paxino (Mrs. Melendez), an inside goalkeeper, and Peter Laurie (Mr. Contreras), an international Esperanto language teacher. Wanda Hendrix is ​​a drunken girl (other) working for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Frankin), is already a willing partner of the Flanders. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert and Miles Mandar, and the best - if not the worst - among many, George Colores) give much hope to the Boyer case (which may soon be understood as Britain's case long ago). Herbert and Mandar backed behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the governments of Ramsay McDonalds and Stanley Baldwin during the civil war. Coulouris here is Colonel Colonel Blimp's model - always flawless in his original English dictionary, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here trying to play as much as she can - but she can not. She is the aristocrat - daughter of the press master. It was Paquel's second film, and (sad to say) almost drowned her long career. She behaves well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual impact of the tournament with Humphrey Bogart and directed by Howard Hawks. Boer is a good actor, but he is not a bogeyman, and Hermann Schumlin is not a hawk. Her next film brought her back to Buggy and Hox again, and her star resumed her ascendancy. <br /> <br /> It's a dark film (as the novel was). Boyer's mission never works, as he has a lot of hidden enemies everywhere. But the wicked are also losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> Dan Seymour is a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxino (and the man who destroys it). Watching a lot of actors in the Warner characters are doing their best, given the weakness in the direction.
