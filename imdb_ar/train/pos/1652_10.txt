This series prompted me to write Deighton and genre when I was younger and loved this presentation of the story. But I do not agree with the above comment. From what I read in the past, it was not Holm's performance that prompted Dayton to refuse to release the series, but the slaughter that all three books received in translation into the screen. An excellent example of this is the rewriting of the border crossing that ended Samson's field march. The scene is not in the book, the personal who died in the mine field were not in any of the books and the transit in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole story is cloth. Changes in Set similarly destroy the integrity of the story. My view of Holm's performance was that he portrayed Elham Samson during his wife's excellent split and I think he fits in well with the portrayal of the aging agent as he strives to bridge the class gap. Samson pays for his father's ideal and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, if he got an education he might have run the department. I think the real loss of performance results from physical appearance more than anything else. Holm is meager compared to Samson's book - an physically impressive man able to use his size to force a presence.
