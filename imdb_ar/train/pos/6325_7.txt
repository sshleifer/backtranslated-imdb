Not only is this movie fun, it's a great comedian, but it's also politically interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but makes fun of the Soviet mentality through and through. The story unfolds in the early days of the Soviet Union and questions the rationale of the revolution both culturally and practically. Of course, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, the strange restrictions of Soviet society were already comfortable, but the ideology and mentality was still alive and well and ready for some of the disintegration it deserved. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
