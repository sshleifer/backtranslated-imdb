This is the Magnus authorship of the Swedish king of crap, Mats Helg Olson. He has rarely made a film of this size in Sweden and is truly emerging as one of the most amazing achievements in the Swedish film so far. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to split into Sweden. But his plans were destroyed by the Russian army he kidnapped and told him he had arrived in Sweden. This trick is their way of seeing that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply of the entire planet. However, the CIA is determined to connect Markov to the West and send the ninja to liberate him. <br /> <br /> The practice of having English-speaking Swedish representatives is something Matisse Helge mastered in his later works. Perhaps the feeling of the cheap B movie created by this is unmatched in terms of performance. But besides this? Well, the action is a standard direct video format. Guns fire a huge geyser of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People are running in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out is the insanely bad way in which scenes of fighting are depicted. When they say "Ninja" in the title I expect the martial arts, I expect heavy fighting. But perhaps there are two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this film. They are hilarious. It is very bad that I lack words to describe it. If the ninja moves any slower their hearts will stop. And of course the whole movie ends in a frenzy that refers to a special effects budget consisting of four food vouchers and a McDonald's coupon. <br /> <br /> So what is judgment? Classical instant course. Never before has a film been produced that obviously consumes with large amounts of alcohol. It's the ultimate party movie. Add video and laughter. One has only to realize that films like these are no longer made. This is the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
