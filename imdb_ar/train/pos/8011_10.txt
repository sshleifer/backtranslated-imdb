This was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know that Miss Baiji's imagination when she met young children was the cause of the children's dummies. The songs will remain in my head forever. Just say it because this stupid Nickelodeon show ya song song is still in my head. Sorry, a bit of a thread there. But anyway what I love is the animal after the credits that say "Goodbye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye! Which made me laugh hard. My absolute favorite is to play in the end. I was surprised that Sesame Street characters appeared at the wedding. I'm happy because this movie was very fun. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can not keep the copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I announced that this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite film!
