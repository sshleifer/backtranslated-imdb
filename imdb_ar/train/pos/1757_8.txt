The key to the 40-year-old Virgin is not only that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but Steve Karel's. In a kind of copper "comedy" that has become distinguished by its lack of humor and attractive characters, the 40-year-old Virgin offers a colorful crew and intelligent intelligent text that does not use the protagonist as the end of an obstacle. Of harsh jokes. That Andy is still a virgin in forty years of age, is not a joke; it is curiosity. <br /> <br /> Karel, a veteran of the Veril team at Anshurman and a former member of Daily Show. , Uses the film concept to expand his character ?? We have to understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this movie work. When an Andy colleague at an electronics store asks him what he did on the weekend, Andy describes his failed cooking efforts. When Andy winds up, he points to his role. Does he decorate his house only with movement figures? He paints and speaks to them and reveals that some of the older people really belong to him since childhood. Comedy will not begin to focus less on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly simple? Andy's co-workers discover he has never had sex, which makes him personally search for his wife in bed with a woman. It is a childish idea and the film does not try to hide its events. <br /> <br /> Friends of Andy are complementary to his nervous nature: David (Paul Rhode) has separated with his girlfriend for more than two years but Jay (Romano Malco) is still obsessed with her, a ladies 'ladies' man and Cal (Seth Rogen) . Their attempts to get Andy in the bag are counterproductive several times, and each time Andy leaves a feeling less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets up with a single mother, Triche (played by Catherine Kenner), and provokes a lot of anger from his worried companions who claim that mothers do not deserve it, he falls in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to postpone sex for twenty days? Tric were not aware that Andy was still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin was directed by Good Abbato, the man who produced Anshurman and Cable Jay, and a short-lived television show began to worship freaks and geeks. Apatow is famous for its unique sense of humor and scenario ?? Co-written by Karel? Offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, the most interesting (indeed amazing) aspect of the 40-year-old virgin is her maturity. Now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing comments from the critics, and was even surprised by its warm reception. But after watching the film, it is easy to understand why. We love Andy. We care about him. Is not it just some cliche comedy sex breakout? He is a real living person who breathes. His neural features combine the best of Woody Allen with naive childishness. His friends do not have unsettling orgasms and his romance is turbulent and bitter. He weighs his shoulder with the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this film is far from being an ideal film, and it certainly contains some mysterious features and sexual humor, it does not hurt as much as other species entries may contain because we have the affection for people on the screen. The best sex comedy works this way? From Risky Business to American Pie? This is the main difference between something like the 40 year old virgin, 40 days and 40 nights.
