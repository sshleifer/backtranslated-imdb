Meatball Machine is a fantastic movie, with original blueprints, acne, buckets of blood, strange alien creatures turning people into terrible machine-gun machines. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is not for everyone, people who love scattered movies or Tetsuo movie: Iron Man will sing it. <br /> <br /> Special effects can be cheese at some point in the movie, but it is not supposed to take the film very seriously. <br /> <br /> However, it is a whole lot of fun, well if you find young romantics infected with a phantom tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien battles.
