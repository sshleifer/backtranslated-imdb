I personally love this film and the novel perfectly (I read the book first and decided to see the film). First of all, the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and I love the cast. Judd Crandall (playing Fred Gwyn) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few wheat lines that have been put there (Idk if they are supposed to be wheat), but they will really temper the mood and laugh well. The Maine atmosphere is an ideal place to shoot this film, which is what draws you through the film. You will not only love them, but you will also need to see them again and again, I recommend this 100% to any fan of horror !!
