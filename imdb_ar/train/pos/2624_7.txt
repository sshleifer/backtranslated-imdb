In this film, we have a fantastic opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Bomba in the film when they are not shown - this is too much! This film dates back to pre-Simba and (perhaps) after the birth of Chiara. <br /> <br /> Quite true in the first film, "Lion King 1/2" or "Lion King 3 elsewhere" is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A series of surprises and joy awaits you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Bumba watch a movie in the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumba are debating about the "Lion King" point to start watching, Timon wants to go to the part when he and Bomba come and want Bomba Return to the beginning. They have a fair compromise to watch their own film, which awaits ... begins with Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a good sense of humor loves the first movies of almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1 / 2 "! :-)
