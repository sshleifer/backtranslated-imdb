Greetings back from darkness. This piece will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it does not live up to that classic, it is very entertaining and well made in itself. The story line is a bit strange and the whole truth of the wall has never been explained, but the execution is good, and it has stirred a strong stir. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays the role of Tristan, who is in front of the wrong girl (Siena) Miller, and agrees to bring her fallen star ... caught by the amazing Claire Danis. There is not much doubt about what's going on with these two, but the interesting part comes in the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the son of Prince Peter O'Toole who is looking to recover the sapphire necklace worn by "our star". A lot of bad chasing good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, encounter the strangest pirates you will see (including any of the Caribbean). Robert Dineiro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard from the inside, and we'll connect to his feminine side. Another encounter is the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-talking dealer and this is useful for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's not your usual chase, your old age or a fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer") is an effort that deserves an audience, but unfortunately the bad marketing campaign might prevent her from making any money. Great video.
