I love this kind of mystery / Police Charlie Chan 1930, that's no exception. However, it seems something bad with this film. A late attempt to switch from the moto-brained films that are centered around the harmony of conspiracies to the tavern of the authorities is tormented by comic relief that relaxes the feet. A typecast player from any place posing as an impersonating English man plays a detective role, and even the other characters seem involved in providing comic relief. The plot may seem strange or sorry to us today, but at the time the possibility of historical archaeological discoveries was not only real but a common occurrence.
