"If I sit I will not stand up again," says the mother (one of the surname) to his son when he tells her to rest (she's only a widow). It means that rest is what a woman of his age must do: rest in peace, and neglect herself. But she is not in the mood "resting", not yet. She also has the daughter of reprimanding for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly, revelation comes: sex and passion in the form of a carpenter younger than thirty years old (Daniel Craig, the completely new James Bond) when "I thought no one touched her again." It's a story that makes you think of many things, especially what 60 things a woman should do with her life when her husband dies. We do not seem to have developed that in those aspects. I mean, no one was surprised when Sean Connery had a love affair in a film with Catherine Zeta Jones ... But what do you think if it is otherwise? An old woman, young ... Nah, you're not ready for that, are you? <br /> <br /> The movie contains intimate tones of length, except for two sequences or 3 strings of broken and outbound lines. Some express and dangerous dialog boxes come. These vulgar touches and the way in which the son and daughter discover their mother's love relationship (very silly - you will know what I mean when you see them) are the only conflicting elements in the "mother". My rate: 7/10
