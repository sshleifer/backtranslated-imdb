I grew up on Doc Savage, and I was shocked by the green death when I was a kid, but so far as now, I found it quite enjoyable. I have made countless friends and colleagues watching this movie and I have enjoyed the variety of reactions, most of them believe I am weird but there you are. "I do not know what is the subject of Doc, but it always gets girls," the final line must be when you look at his sad band of men. This movie is a classic spoof on every kind of superhero, and before the time came, it should not be taken seriously, or we move on to Austin Powers. Ron Ely is God.It is unfortunately that this movie has not been released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it should be new and, as I said, it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like Italian post without Menez and Michael Kane). I give it 10/10.
