Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of contestants are collaborating with the "veteran" crook to get themselves out of poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the camouflage factor. <br /> <br /> It's good to see George Clooney doing something really funny to change. The casting is perfect and the representation standards are very high. Although it can be said that the Motley crew theme is not new, I think this film deals with it in an interesting and unique way. Enough enough to stand out from what went before. Very good guys.
