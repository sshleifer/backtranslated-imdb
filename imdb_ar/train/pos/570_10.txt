Oddly, I saw this film for the first time, 13 years after it was released. It is a story that any father or brother can contact ... someone is slightly "wild" and the other brother is the older child. Craig Schaeffer is a little emotional like the older brother, but the house is amazing, and Scott is ideally represented as a father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are very interesting ... I had no idea that fishing by flies could be very attractive. The film follows the book closely, with some modifications just to make it more suitable for film coordination. Unlike most books for film stories, this story unfolds. It is a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a strong and somewhat emotional film.
