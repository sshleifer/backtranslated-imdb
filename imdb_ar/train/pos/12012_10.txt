I saw him at the Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that the level of enjoyment of the individual during this film will depend to a large extent on the level of individual acceptance of Joseph's story. Beautiful degree. If you arrive in Salt Lake City, you should see it at the Legacy Theater. I was not in the most beautiful theater in terms of image quality, sound quality and ambience in my whole life ... I wonder if the church will let me watch Batman starting there! Since I am LDS and I am considered a prophet, I have been affected in several places and have been hit several times ... which I suppose is expected since the tissue was distributed before the movie started! Anyway, I've been told that this movie is available at many LDS visitor centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes, you can check it because whether you think Joseph Smith or not, it tells a wonderful story.
