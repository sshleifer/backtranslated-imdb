Stargate SG-1 is a separate film from the 1994 film "Stargate". I am very happy because they have decided to expand on this subject. The show begins with the first episode, and retired Jack O'Neill must pass through the gate again to meet his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. During the first two episodes, we met Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who was not allowed to walk over, and there Teal'c, a quiet and compassionate warrior defying his false god and joining the team. <br /> <br /> The main villains are called gulad, parasites that can be inserted into the individual's brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. A Gould has a great deal of power and is often considered "Lord of the Order". The warriors behind Gold are called Jaffa, which houses the parasite in their bodies so that it can be inserted into a person's brain. <br /> <br /> Through episodes, we often learn about the SG-1 Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / Sam exploratory team, passing through the hole that immediately takes them to other planets (called Stargate ) And face new or evil cultures. Some episodes exist around the world, which means that they do not pass through Stargate once in a loop, but deal with pressing issues on the ground. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you begin to see a drop in the SG-1 team as closely knit, and more lines of story building personal. This, in turn, means more episodes around the world, which is quite understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this offer is good, there are some cases where story lines do not always conclude and less focus on portal travel these last few years. But still, top sci-fi!
