Until I saw this special on HBO, I never heard of Eddie Isard. I'm sure I'm happy that I am now! He's one of the most comedians I've ever seen! The comedian rarely immersed himself completely in his career and then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the whole show. If you would like to laugh you have to see this special!
