Kurt Russell, who started his career when he kicked Real Elvis at an event at the World Exposition, is likely not to top his performance as King in this biased Carpenter-shocked biography. There are times when you feel like you're watching Elvis until something brings you back to reality ... maybe memories of the hapless Johnson without Elvis and Beauty Queen? All of the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hengel as Colonel, until Shelley Winters brings the proper level of nerves and hysteria to her role in presenting Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's dad Bing is the father of Alves Vernon, and there is a wonderful performance by Robert Gray as a friend and personal guard for Red West. <br /> <br /> You should see A for rock and roll fans.
