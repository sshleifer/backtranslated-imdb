I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice and that's something I'm saying about a documentary film. The music, film and sound result is amazing as you might expect from Imax production. Although it was filmed in the huge Imax theaters, it looks great on a home system. In fact, this will create a perfect DVD to display your system. <br /> <br /> The theme is also great. It is located around Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I have already been a fan of Mario because he is the best driving car racing in history because he is the only person to win the CART, F1 Championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows two very important car tracks: father and son. The first car was found in a chicken coop and turned out to be the first racing car ever driven by Mario, and we are following the restoration process to a brilliant finish. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow it from the mold cut during the race season. Imax lends the right charm to make car building amusing and exquisite. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time of making this film, tells the film. Tales and intelligence, derived from many years as owner and driver, add a lot to production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is racing scenes. Raise the volume here! There is something about riding more than 200 miles per hour and the musical result that draws you completely to the screen for an unforgettable experience. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. God of racing, Mario Andretti, loving father who proudly watches his son's life. They work together so well that every father and son sees this. You can tell that they are a close family. I hope we have all this experience.
