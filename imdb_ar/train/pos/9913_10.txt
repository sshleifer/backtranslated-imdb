In addition to being a very interesting film, I would add that the costumes and landscapes were wonderful. This kind of fun was a woman who loved a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two bright daughters eager to put their hands on her money. This woman has been single since the death of her husband. He had suggested it in the theater which would have been demolished. To prevent this, you bought it. Her daughters were afraid of throwing their money and "decided" to take action. The actors in this film were also a wonderful addition. I would give almost anything to get a copy of this movie in my video library, but so far it has not been released. Sad.
