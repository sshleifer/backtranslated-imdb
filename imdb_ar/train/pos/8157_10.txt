R rating for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the most entertaining and most entertaining comedy series ever. It's basically a version of the gang rap for the movie This Is Spinal Tap.It's a shame - many people have not heard about this jewel from a movie. If you can find this movie anywhere do not hesitate to buy it even if you do not like rap. There are not a lot of comedy movies that I give 10/10 to perfection. The only ones I can think of right now are the movie, Clarex, The World Word to Garb, the 40-year-old Virgin and Chasing Cam. This film is a stereotype of the joy of rap music revolves around a woman named Nina Blackburn making a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N *** z with hats). It's basically the stereotype of the rap group that makes many controversial rap songs about murder and being gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of gang rap scene. It is a shame that this film is not among the top 250 films. <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88 minutes <br /> <br /> 10/10
