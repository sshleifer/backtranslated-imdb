There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Ms. Davies was a "clip" of this film; the one that is cheerful and cheerful and which cuts the veil to reveal the different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was to watch this film, for the time being; however, it is possible that I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines gives an incredible impression, when he joins Davis for a table meal - where he throws his hat into the ring with some wonderful pieces on the dining table. In fact, Haines and Davies offer great comedies. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), who leads Davies daughter to Hollywood, and will certainly become the latest Tinseltown sensation. In fact, Davis and Heinz have already reached comedy stars. But Davis longs to become the real drama queen. He leaves Davis Haines, and collaborates with Paul Raleigh Dramatic. But fans prefer Davis in more comic roles. Perhaps the director King Fedor presents an issue of art imitates life? <br /> <br /> Full of gorgeous Hollywood footage, both in and out of the group. Filled with a great "etching". At the studio lunch, at the star table, Davis is located between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. However, the best "bit" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask Davies about signing it! Although successful films are fun, they, as well as occasional sequences, help "show people" to become less important films, and more important historical documents. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
