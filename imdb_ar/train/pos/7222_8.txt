Definitely one of the most people I have ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michelle Caen were wonderful and kept us in this whole case. <br /> <br /> The very stylish pieces and props really make the atmosphere feel actionable. Works minimal feeling on the entire picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not about the movie itself, but the lack of a suitable widescreen version of the movie on DVD. I have a full-screen version (which proves I love the movie enough to carry the presentation full screen) but the Deluxe or special version will get cash.
