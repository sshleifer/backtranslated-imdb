Since musical music is outdated and incredibly expensive to make without all the talent for a single contract work with a studio, I doubt we will have a real life story from Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else is in place, it is no coincidence that no Hollywood studio is trying to do the job until Mario Lanza has signed with Goldwyn. No one can do that, and I doubt whether he will be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should he. I think Enrico Caruso himself was satisfied with how his screen was filmed. Because his voice was his life, and the reason for his existence on earth. <br /> <br /> The saying that freedoms have taken place in his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man he pictured, was a man of great appetite, though he had a lot of self-discipline. He had many relationships with many women and had two sons of matrimony who were not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry has been treated as an almost late idea. He appeared in a recording studio once in his late life. In fact, the recording began directly at the turn of the century, and along with the Irish tenor John McCormack of RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their peak, you had to actually inherit a ticket to see which leads directly. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a sound recording, a record, or three of these men. That's why they both became legends. <br /> <br /> What the film contains is some of the beautiful theater festivals performed by Mario Lanza, tasting what might become if it was the discipline at Caruso to stick to the opera. Great Caruso won the Oscars for voice recording and received nominations for fashion and fashion design. <br /> <br /> Mario helped promote the film through the RCA Red Seal album of The Great Caruso. Unfortunately because of our contractual obligations, we were unable to obtain an actual photo album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmela Novotna as well. <br /> <br /> Although Blythe is rich in the film, Lanza has made a big hit in The The Most Beautiful Night of the Year to help promote The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the life of Enrico Caruso, this is not so. If you're looking for a great artist to sing at the height of your career, you should not miss the Great Caruso.
