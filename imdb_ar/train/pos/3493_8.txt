This film is deprecating. loved it. It was really sweet and hearty. A family struggles but does not turn into a dysfunctional family that is typical of movies today. The film did not make it a problem that they had little money or that Dominican Republicans did just as Hollywood did. <br /> <br /> Instead, the case is Victor is immature and needs to grow. He does slowly with the end of the film. He had ways to go, but it was a heart attack to go ahead. His grandmother was very nice and the sight of the little boy made me laugh for the longest time. Indy is really hearty
