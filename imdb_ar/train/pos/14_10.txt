This film occupies a special place in my heart. When I first learned it, I taught adult literacy. It was true for me and even for the outstanding student I had at the time. There are scenes that make you enjoy sudden feelings, and those that put a smile on your face by identifying her personality and condition. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Jean Fonda and Robert De Niro, rated as their best works, are a wonderful role for Martha Plympton's young man, an inspiring storyline, and a great musical score that makes a fun and rewarding experience.
