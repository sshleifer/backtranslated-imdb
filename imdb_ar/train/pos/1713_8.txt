This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Suha Ali and Abhay Deol look very beautiful. Soha reminds you of a lot of her mother, Charmila Tagore. Abhay's born actor will rise a lot in the near future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is quite different from most movies. In a way you are not satisfied but if you actually think about it in real terms, you realize that the only reasonable end is the end in the film. Otherwise, it was a grievous injustice to all. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a professional witness who encounters a girl waiting to get married in court. Her friend does not appear and ends up with the help of the witness. Very slowly, over time, falls in love with her. It is not clear whether she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for full details. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more of it. Soha beautiful but did not talk much in the film. Her eyes, she did her innocence most talk.
