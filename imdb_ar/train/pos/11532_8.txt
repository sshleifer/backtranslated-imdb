Well, this was one of those movies I caught, and it was good for me to record her time the next time ... If, like me, you enjoy the many horror scenes of the 1980s that branched out from the base (that is not just another plethora of a general sequel) ) Then I think you might enjoy this. When a bad person finally appears in a person, it is not certainly what you expected to see! All in all, I will not go out on this subject, but if you like this type, look for it if it appears, and you have an hour and a half kill, I think. I'll give it 6.5 out of 10.
