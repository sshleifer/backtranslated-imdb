Goebbels motive is not explored in retreat. In the wake of Stalingrad the Reich decided to go to a "comprehensive war". This is referred to in the film. Part of this was the use of women in the war effort, something Germany had not done before. It was possible to face the massacre of women's special security forces Jubiles with a public relations disaster by a large percentage. His preference was to make the problem disappear as quietly as possible, on the grounds that Jewish men could always be assembled later. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that "red" Berlin was never very enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be treated with caution. Again, the massacre of women may have cost the Nazis the average level of support they received in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms showed corrections indicating that the men they wore were not of German nationality but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
