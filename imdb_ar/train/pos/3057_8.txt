Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Messi is as wonderful as Alex Alex. <br /> <br /> All the presentations here are really good, and the plot is exciting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married man hit (like his father) and has a young son, is going through a middle-aged crisis and wants to leave the family business until he goes to the psychiatrist for help. Cord. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill someone he knows. <br /> <br /> I advise you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
