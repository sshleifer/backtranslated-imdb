Classical drama / Western movement with incredible cinematic progress long (1954). The production is very good and you can say that it was done with pride and love. A glance at the NORTHT WEST AMERICAN LEADERS is a very entertaining and educational game. This film is less than rated because most people do not like to see the fact that many "lawyers" during this time and space were very specific / corrupt just like most developing countries today. The sequence of events could have been more realistic although it still, this film really covers most of the basics. No audience just wants pure Western-type testosterone for this film is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
