I watched his film in Dallas, Texas, when it was released in 1986. I remember them awarding prizes for their viewing of the film. After watching the film I can see why. The film was not bad and was not great. The problem with this film was that he tried to tell a side story. They created a new story and new characters and tried to wrap it around Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot revolves around a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking Earth. They even used the same scenes from Master Saga but with a different dialogue. As a child, I loved the film. Unfortunately, I did not see her as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed but now I love watching the film and re-evaluating my position on it. After this was said, would someone issue this film to be judged by the whole world? I love Robotech and I can not wait for the ghost records.
