Erik Romer "Lady and the Duke". You can use a better translation of the title. Perhaps "English women and the Duke" were more accurate. While it is clear that this film is not for everyone, and based on the comments on this forum, it is worth watching because, despite the complex pattern of the story, Mr. Romer created a film that can be seen as a museum art exhibition. The hybrid technology used in the film works well in the end. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Eliot, a noble lady who was the mistress of the King of England and the French Duchy, holds our attention. The setting is Paris during the days following the French Revolution. The country was in turmoil and power was in the hands of the people, who were less able to care for the aristocrats. The pictures show that the rioters are running with the heads of the famous people immediately after their journey to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> Grace has ended with Doc, but remains a true friend of the great man at risk, of losing his head. Grace moves through all the horrors surrounding her without being able to escape. She even has an enemy in her house, in the form of a cook, Polshiri, who will not hesitate to denounce at least provocation. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie, at times, gives the viewer the impression of being on a journey through the Louvre, watching the huge paintings depicting this crucial period of French history. Instead of finding the digitization process that distracts our attention, we found it to improve the film in several ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, does a good job of portraying this woman she has seen so much in her life. It seems that her French language is excellent, since she seems to be fluent in it. As Duc d'Orleans, Jean-Claude Dreyfus made a wonderful contribution that made us think he was the same noble without any effort. The cast support was also great. As a musical band, Mr. RÃ¶mer gets good performances everywhere. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, "The Lady and the Duke" will be a thrilling film to see the movie thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
