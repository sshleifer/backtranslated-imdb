Masterpiece Like the first two films of the Snowy River was, the sequel to a man from a snowy river is all that must be followed. He does not step on his fingers, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film to live in some unique eternity. <br /> <br /> "The Man From Snowy River II" is based on Jim Craig's return to the country as a snowy river after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells the story of change in the 19th century, about Australian history, legends and horses. The story of the film illustrates a touch of Hollywood in a lighter shade, an aspect that was completely absent in the first film, but it blends uniquely with the sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more lively than the first film, and much more flashy, with certain aspects of the former incorporated into the film, yet the man from Snowy II has all the essential characteristics of the first film; It is the second most impressive footage of the horses ever shot, and a very impressive and moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, which is the first equivalent of everything. Geoff Burrowes has done a great job in this film, and it deserves recognition, especially for the quality of the Australian film industry. The actors, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and Brian Denny, who has been well replaced, lead their parts with great passion and distinction such as the first film. As far as the sequel can be, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a very moving and inspiring experience again.
