When we talk about the Hollywood Hotel, we can talk about one of three things, the actual hotel, the radio program, and this film which was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell was host of the Hollywood Hotel on CBS, where Loyla Parsons took the weekly shovel on the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons launched the Hollywood Hollywood program in 1934, by 1937. Their fair share of the radio audience. She hosted Powell, sang, and kibitzed with Luila and her star movie guests. Thanks to the power she has in her column, she managed to get the various stars to move forward and deliver their latest movies for nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists intervened and asked them to pay wages accordingly and won the case. The Hollywood Hotel program ended in 1938. Of course, Powell and Luila went to other radio spots. The whole story is covered in Tony Thomas's film, Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before pulling the plug, the film appeared from Powell's studio on Warner Brothers inspired by the radio show. Powell plays the singer / saxophone player with the band Penny Goodman, who signed a contract in Hollywood. But when he goes to Hollywood, he intertwines with the selfish film star Lola Lane, her real sister sister Rosemary Lane, and the pork representative at Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in a civil war epic he makes with Lula Lin, it's Powell's voice that they use. Mowbray then gets Lina Lamont's problem when he is asked to go to the radio show at the Hollywood Hotel, which is broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel. This got the studio in tizzy. Let's say the problem has not been solved like Singing In The Rain, but Ted Healy, the Powell director, has proved to be wise. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiteing and Johnny Mercer offer a truly wonderful result. The big song comes in the beginning as the Penny Goodman band performs a band singing Johnny Davis singing Hollywood hymns, Horai to Hollywood. But my favorite is the vocals of Paul and Rosemary Lin, and I love a fish out of the water. Just listening to Johnny Mercer's words about Ginger Rogers, who runs the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without fans, is a synthesis of popular American culture in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley is designing dances here and while the film does not do you have high imaginary things that you did earlier with Warner Bros., the numbers are well organized. The big Berkeley moment is in a restaurant where Powell and Healy are forced to fill jobs. The figure starts with Benny Goodman from the Hollywood hotel, Let It Be A Lesson to You and then in Powell's car, Lynn and the whole place begins to join a song to entice the owner Edgar Kennedy. You'll know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's discontent. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman gets the reason why he was appointed King of Swing when the band was with drummer Jane Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton as part of his group. This along with Francis Langford singing as well. Perhaps the last member of the surviving cast of the group is a fellow radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th President of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always played with Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two men in the Warner Brothers team who were more helpful to the eager young player who is trying to make his mark. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood Hotel is a delightful, enjoyable, moving, yet enchanting picture.
