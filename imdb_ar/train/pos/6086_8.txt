I watched this movie about a year ago, and I found it laughing completely with a funny voice. A real winner, in my opinion. She had a stupid comedy underline, but in fact it was a real conspiracy as well. Much like the successful comedy, Elf, actually. A few dangerous moments passed, located between hilarious. When Stellar launched Black's Horse, a normal moment, you found yourself laughing at his mysterious instincts. You can actually find a common ground there, as I'm sure a lot of people have done something a friend did not want to know, lest your friendship end. <br /> <br /> When I discovered how much people hated this movie, I was totally shocked. That very horrible films like Napoleon Dynamite had higher ratings than I wonder about the rationality of people on IMDb. Take my advice and hire it. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for the rent. = D
