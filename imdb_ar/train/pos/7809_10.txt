This film has pushed me beyond understanding, and it will remain my favorite film of all time, mainly because almost all the emotions have reached 157 minutes. The hardest part for me is that whenever I want to hear the music and the amazing songs from the movie, I have to put them in the DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone knew who sang songs in the movie and where to find them, as I looked everywhere I could think of Intermittently over the past five years. My favorite quote from the film is when the lawyer says in court, "But your own words require direct confrontation, is not this a direct call to violence?" "Well, you and I are facing now, but I do not see violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
