** Warning - this publication may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got Game Cube in September 2005, and my first two games were James Bond, Undersecretary Undersecretary, and Golden Rogue. The next game I planned to get was "All or Nothing", because my friend told me it was better than the two games I had already done. I must say, I've been right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for a boss at HMV, and when I got home, I slammed it into my Cube and played it for consecutive hours. It was much better than my other game, and there was a much better and more interesting story. Graphics were the best I've ever seen (but now that XBOX 360 has been launched, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best known graphics for humans). The story was clever. A crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful followers (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with little robots, which, James Bond, you have to destroy on a train. The bad thing is that someone is hidden in Katya's breasts. You must then thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that it already has representatives expressing characters, such as Cleese Expressing Q. There are 27 levels, some are short and some are very long and difficult. <br /> <br /> Play - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Reset Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
