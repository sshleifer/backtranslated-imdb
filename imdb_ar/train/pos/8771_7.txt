ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles. He was a professional player from a deadly Irish family. He became the world heavyweight champion at the time John L. SULLIVAN (WARD BOND) claiming to be "able to overcome any man alive." Flynn Word Bond offers what may be among the best presentations they have made on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ra√∫l Walsh produced the colorful story in a strong style, capturing family life as well as warm, hearty scenes full of humor. All the Warner Bros. players make up a wonderful collection - including Alan Hull, who is always reliable as the arrogant father of Flynn, who prides himself on his son's combat abilities, and Alexis Smith, who makes the most of her role as a brave girl in the community. His etiquette is arrogant. <br /> <br /> All the atmosphere of the 1980s was captured in the glorious B & W, although it was so bad that Warners did not have much confidence in Flynn to do the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his career at the time, taking part in a widespread rape trial, and all the popular newspapers were busy sorting things out. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are among the best scenes ever designed, with Flynn clearly in good shape and very little use of doubles for most of the action. The scene in which Bond delivers his award to Flynn at a social gathering is one of the best moments in a long career as a representative of the characters. <br /> <br /> Summary: Keeps interest all the way, whether you're a sports fan or not.
