What a fun movie. It reminds me of the kind of film that was produced during the 1940s. A classic story, circled by characters and plot is no more exciting or complex publicly. Actually it was not more than anything. The story of Robert Louis Stevenson - quoted here on screen - reads like Jane Austen's Men. We have a story that has a love story in her heart, but there is also a lot of fun: the scenes of battles (some sort of), the escape from prison, the wrong identities, the swordsmen, and the lines that I have heard for years: "Only in Scotland will the names of the guests be revealed in a masked ball." There is a lot of joy and difficulty and not a little sadness as St. Ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and a life he barely knows. <br /> <br /> The cast is very excellent too I have seen Jean-Marc Bar perfectly fit in a starring role. Anna Freil is a refreshing joy, as Flora and Miranda Richardson approach the two bands of the movie as a hymn to her and mundane, and were there and watched Aunt Susan. Richard Grant offers a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This will not be the greatest film no one has ever seen, but its magic is undeniable, and the entire film is revived to some extent with vibrant energy.
