Have you ever had a pet with you during good and bad, and who you will lose, and who you love no matter what? They never even thought they felt the same way about you! <br /> <br /> A wonderful family movie. If you have a soft spot for the animals, this ensures you cry no matter how old you are. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a little boy, and I find that at the age of 16, I loved him as much as I did then. I could not make a decision about a favorite character at that time, and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but feuding family. I love Shans, and how he finally says he has a family in the end. Yes, but one must remember that it is supposed to be a family film, and performs this role perfectly. Sassy enjoys the perfect dose of "sassiness", and Shadow is the ideal leader / role of young adventurous opportunities. <br /> <br /> The way animals are superior to humans, but of course most of the dizzying moments to be during interaction with them (ie saving Molly, the end). Not to mention the stunning soundtrack that gives each moment more feelings, and the feeling associated with heart swelling. I give this 9/10. To compare (and even better classification of) cats, dogs and a door.
