I watched this film while it was under limited release, mainly because of the novelty of Pierce Brosnan's vision with Sharp, but it turned out to be one of the most popular films I've seen all year. It starts almost as a thriller, but it progresses steadily to a hilarious work full of energy and a great comedic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kenner. Also, while I say this movie is comedic, it does not forget that it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to. When I entered the theater, I did not know what I expected more than just a mustache, but what I got was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. When I left the theater I felt very satisfied with the film and planned to see it again in a wide presentation. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with well written text and a great drink.
