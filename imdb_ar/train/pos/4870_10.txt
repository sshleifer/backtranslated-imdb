The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world prepares itself for innocent people and pure souls and everything has a "happy ending", just like in the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great audio track and a mix of Serbian folk music and gypsy and jazz music. <br /> <br /> This film is a piece of very refreshing visual poets. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching like you has been absorbed in another colorful, romantic and at times difficult world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica must be.
