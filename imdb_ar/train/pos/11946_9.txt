*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian MacShane, Romola Garria. Directed by Woody Allen. Immediately after working with Johansson on "Match Point", the two return to "Scoop" on a comic trip from Corky and Zany and the fun. When a student reporter (Johansson) discovers a new scoop from a deceased reporter (McShane) when she enters the charming magician (Allen). The object of the shovel is for the new Tarot card killer in London who may be preppy Peter Lehman (Jackman); while playing Sundra and Detective Lord lies Soundra in love and handsome will be the killer. Allen has finally reached a mark, not as good as "Match Point" but definitely more fun. I laughed more than I expected, you should see one of the years
