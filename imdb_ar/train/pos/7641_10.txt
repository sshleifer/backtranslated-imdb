Everyone plays their part well in this "beautiful little movie". Belushi gets a chance to live in part of his life in a different way, but ends up realizing that what he was would be good and maybe even better. The film tells us that we have to take advantage of our opportunities, not opportunities that we do not have or can not get. If you can get this movie via video for about $ 10, it will be an investment!
