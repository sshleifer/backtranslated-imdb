I remember watching this movie originally at Radio City Music Hall when it appeared. I did not really understand humor at the time, but this movie could make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau Oscar really deserved this film. His performance is stunning - given the fact that he was younger than his character, Willie Clarke, 20 years old. His behavior is first class. ("You know what type of songs are written by" Sh * t! "And when talking to the Spanish-speaking man at the front desk:" No! No! <br /> <br /> Glory to Richard Benjamin, who played the role of Straight Man with Matthau. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it to be on a DVD, because my VHS record has become a bit old. <br /> <br /> No interest in seeing a remake with Woody Allen, because it can by no means match the original.
