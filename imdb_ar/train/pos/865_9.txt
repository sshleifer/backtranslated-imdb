Vincent Cassell plays the role of Paul, who is previously conceived in a desk job where Carla, a completely deaf secretary, meets when she has hearing aids too deaf ?? When not (played by Emmanuel Devos). Together they help each other evolve as people. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this movie is the complexity of characters ?? Not appropriate in stereotypes are obvious. Paul seems uncomfortable in the office environment, does he just keep working? This belief is dispelled when a job gets in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film contains some of the moral I find refreshing and shows how easy criminal conduct is, even if we think it is harmless or justifiable. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie full of wonderful and moving moments. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to please a screaming child. It continues to embrace it? But takes her hearing out for her comfort.
