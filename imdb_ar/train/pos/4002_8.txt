At the beginning of the film, we watch May and Tots prepare for their trip to London to visit their adult children. One can see Tots not in the best health, but he walks with him. When suddenly dies, the world of May begins, out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michel, based on a play by Hanif Kurishi, is a study of how this mother character is known with her new status in life and waking up in a world she does not know exists yet. <br /> <br /> May's life as a wife from the suburbs may have been boring. It is clear that her sexuality was next to nothing. We recognize that they had a short marital relationship, then nothing at all. When Mai loses her husband, she can not go home, so she is too late to think of her grandson in her daughter's house. In this framework, Mai begins to grumble after Darren, a young and beloved, her daughter's occasional mistress. <br /> <br /> Darren woke last May on a passion she had never known before. May respond by turning itself in front of our eyes. Mi, who at the beginning of the pony movie, suddenly starts to wear clothes, to become an exciting and attractive woman. She ended up falling on their heads with this young man who kept her clinging to the passion she had never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a few similar cases to this story, it was no surprise to me to watch May's reaction. Her own chance for a natural relationship with Bruce, a widow, ends up frustratingly for May, who realizes how great her sex is with Darren. The younger man, as we see, is only in the case to satisfy himself and the possibility of extorting money from May. Finally, Helen, the daughter, discovers what my mother was doing behind her back when she discovered the exciting paintings her mother had made. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. At Anne Reed, Mr. Michel found an unusual actress bringing a lot to May's role. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story because she is the one that must confront the mother about what happened behind her back. Oliver Davis plays a small role in the role of Bruce, the older man in Helen's class, who is very effective. <br /> <br /> The film rewards those you will see with an open mind. <br /> <br />
