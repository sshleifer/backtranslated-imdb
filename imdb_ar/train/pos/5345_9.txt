Yesterday I and my Spanish / Catalan wife saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is heading towards political confrontation again. That's why this masterpiece should appear in all Spanish high schools. It is an enormous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses the democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is amazingly striking in one of Uribe's most creative scenes ever. The colors are wonderful. The cruelty of war (can anyone tell me the difference between war and civil war?) Is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who begin to abuse power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like "El viaje de Carol" / "Carol's Journey" tells one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It is a better lesson in history than any book can contain. Once again the great work of the Iberica Peninsula!
