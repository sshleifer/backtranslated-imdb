What makes this film so frightening is the way in which Andr√© and Calvin are portrayed as ordinary men. Sure, these are not people who want to become professional filmmakers because they walk in front of the camera, forget the text lines, and so on. They make video only as memos to show the "lives of the survivors" how normal their lives were. Their parents just think that men are filming for a family home video. By searching for other children's attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what they should not do and know (usually in a silly way, "Andres and Calvins"). They might watch this video how they make bombs, get weapons, Falling before day zero (day of attack).
