"Panic in the Streets" is a somewhat unknown film by Elijah Kazan, made before his classic masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan already won the Oscars in 1947, before this film, so he was not fully known at the time. Still "street panic" is a movie passed under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is the Oscar-winning script. It has a very good concept and its excellent erotic materials with sniffing of crime / film noir elements. The dialog box in this film is also wonderful and gives the film a sense of realism and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is somewhat unknown (especially at the time of its release) but still features Zero Mostel and Jack Balance in one of their first cinematic roles. Palance is especially impressive as a tough, very strong-looking gang leader. <br /> <br /> The film is still long at some points. The film begins very well but after the start of the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of speed and from the point of view of the story that is listed from. <br /> <br /> However, "Panic in Streets Keeps" is a totally wonderful film, mainly due to the strong script and powerful dialogue that makes the movie a believable film to watch. For fans of this kind of excitement this is a wonderful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
