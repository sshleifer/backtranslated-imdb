First, there is no way that the new version can be good, because Japanese society is completely different from our society and plays a major role in this film, as described in the opening narrative. He adds to the humor as well as the warmth of this film. There are a large number of different characters / supporters. Is there a part in making this wonderful film. This film is full of comedy that is not vulgar in any case like most "gross comedy" today. However, you can still laugh out loud. In fact, in fact, you have no choice for those you work with or go to school with him ... etc. This film really confirms that it shows that the natural good of people can overcome minor differences. Not to mention that, it makes a lot of land and lots of humor. This is a story about a dance that has a story already, and a good story in it. There are a few background stories that were not misplaced, but actually support the main line. Really a well written film. Dance is also wonderful. I've been a fan of any movie with dancing of any kind, for this aspect. However, this film transcends any other dance, in fact, it is a story first and only happens about dancing in the Japanse community. strongly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
