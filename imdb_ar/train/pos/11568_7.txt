One of the many Merrie Melodies that American filmgoers enjoyed during World War II, "An Itch in Time" is filmed for the homeless Bob Clambett movie that settles on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little man turns into a real sadist while he is at home on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another hour and I will give you a bath!" Meanwhile, fleas place a dynamite on the dog! * This is not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer reads a comic book featuring Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. It is clear that Elmer and Baggs often participated in the tournament but Elmer never participated with Burke (unless you repeat the words "any bonds today?"). But for me, Elmer thought of reading these other famous characters of the same sex emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of its presence in his world even though it did not appear in this cartoon. <br /> <br /> Of course, I might go away in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon was intended for pure entertainment, and it is certainly entertaining. As for the "I might like this" line, it seems that this was something the sergeants did not allow, but somehow missed; I, for one, do not really know what it was supposed to look like. Was it something sexy? For the end, if I thought I saw everything, I'd be tempted to look for more, instead of doing what the cat did (although it was a clean trick). <br /> <br /> Of course, the people behind these cartoons have something for TNT, do not they?
