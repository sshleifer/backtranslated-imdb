I first saw this half-time ago on a black and white TV in a small village in Samoa, and I thought it was hilarious. Now, after seeing her for the second time, much later, I do not find her gay. I have not found anything hilarious anymore. But this is a playful comedy with a light heart and moves fast without faltering, and I enjoyed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> It is 1945 and Fred McMurray 4F dies to enter one of the armed forces. He rubbed a lamp into the scrap he ran, and the jackpot seemed to give him some wishes. (It's hum, is not it? But although the intro is no more than good, the illusions are very vital.) McMurray tells Genie he wants to be in the army. Poof, who walks along with the Washington soldiers at a warm and attractive USO where June Haver and Joan Leslie wear a lot of lace bedlinen or whatever they are, and lavender wigs. Washington sends McMurray to spy on the enemy - a red paint, Hesian speak German, not British. The hyacinths are baffled at Bierstube and sing a very bright song praising the virtues of Vaterland, "where the white wine is the Rhine / the Rhine's water / bratwurst is the mellower / the yellow hair is yellow / the Frauleins are jucier / the goose steps are goosier." Great descriptions, good like Sig Roman. Otto Breminger is a suspicious and evil general. "As you know, Heidelberg, there are 241 to 1 against you, but do not be afraid of this." <br /> <br /> I can not last long with these fantasies but they are all very funny, as are the lyrics. When he wishes he was in the Navy, McMurray ends up in Columbus and the fantasy is presented as a major opera. "Do not you know that sailing west means a high-cost investment? And who assumes that it provides the means? But Isabella Queen of Queens." When they see the New World, someone notices that it is wonderful. "I do not care what it looks like," Columbus shouts, "but this place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> In any case, everything is permanently corrected, although the harvest at this time is very drunk, and MacMurray ends up in the Marine Corps with the appropriate girl. <br /> <br /> I've made him look very nice, maybe, but he's cute. Children will enjoy blowing smoke, magic and a love story. Adults will get a kick from the most challenging elements of the story (who are they obsessed?) Unless they come across as university graduates, in which case they may want to stick to the leader and say, "Wow!
