In the same way that Frank Miller and the film-makers of Sin City used him in black and white to express himself (and the effects of his film Noir), as well as Christian Volkman with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It is the year 2054, in Paris. In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a shining gem and sparkling multi-tear. This gem is in an atmosphere of misery, injustice and darkness. Bright and beautiful on the top with under it darkness. One of those "bright" people at the summit, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is being kidnapped. Captain Carras (known as the new James Bond - Daniel Craig), known and effective, was tasked with finding them. <br /> <br /> The plot and planning are not overly original. This film is strongly influenced by Noir films, the smell of Gibson's neural laboratory and other editorial stories, as well as films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang Metropolis and Minority Report. There is a main plot, surrounded by other potential sub plots that all relate in the end. It is not difficult to identify all of this. <br /> <br /> The power and originality of the film lies in its intense visual presentation. Paris is a complex set of levels and sub-levels. In its base the most primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, its architectural complexity and brilliance are further enhanced. However, in this structure, the upper part is not equal with high ideals and human behavior. Paris was moved in a complex manner and was painted in brilliant white and black. The film is closer to his soul with Sin City (comedy) then Sin City was the film with his original material. This is done more easily, because it is still in the middle itself relatively; vital. In the same way the scanner pushed the visual aspects of storytelling, he did. Light and dark, black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time before us. The film shows how black and white can be both mysterious and clear at the same time. <br /> <br /> In line with the spirit of the film, I can be a critic and a lover. I love and hate the same light. It is definitely an experience I recommend to lovers of visual arts. So pour another Black and Tan, enter the space and enjoy the trip.
