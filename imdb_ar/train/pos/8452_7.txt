Electrified mobile allowances can eliminate entire armies - check! Weapons that do not need to be addressed and still eliminate everything - check! Mobile allowances based on angels - check! <br /> <br /> Well - it's the Gundam series. Enjoy this suite, Gundam Wing, a good development of personality, complexity in the real world, interesting ideas, and some lovely dessert. <br /> <br /> With the characters, initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although he is still completely surrounded with Heero Yuy, the main character of the series). Heero mentioned above, initially a cold and difficult butcher, becomes more and more humane, while still in character. The vision of the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whomm nomm de guerre Zechs Marquise) floats between OZ, self-employed, and the leadership of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also very good - reflecting how the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it becomes part of the responsibility not to use this complexity to its full potential. <br /> <br /> The ideas at the heart of the chain - the need to fight, the desire for peace, etc. - are those that resonate to this day. When going back, the chain was ahead of its time, including the "war on terror" and everything. But her exploration of these ideas, monologues, especially that of Teresa Kouchnerina, is an amazing piece of drama, and constitutes some of the best writings in the series. <br /> <br /> Sometimes good writing is also sometimes very bad. , Which makes him lose a great deal of his edge. <br /> <br /> In terms of eye candy, which this person has in small donkeys, everything from mobile suits to barges (not cotton clogs) are stupid!) well designed, and explode in large balls of The orange color (which is bad, because the best animation would have got better blasts). But who cares ?! Things explode, that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you missed some episodes, you missed a lot. Can leave you bad writing oscillating, sometimes make you cartoon go "WTF?!?!" But this is made up of the classic animation style, its size, the stunning dialogue and the more mature exploration one expects from Japanese animation.
