Twisted, strange, enchanting, and hilarious! I could not stop laughing at watching this movie. Darren Stein shows the films he made on the family video camera that originated in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at the emerging film director, his motivations and his ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a powerful word, but do not we all watch movies to manipulate them in one way or another? <br /> <br /> From the start, I was relieved by the fact that the boys in the movies looked as if they looked shirtless whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on emerging homosexuality, and you can see it from the hints (big hints!) Of the thumb at an early age. Maybe it was just Southern California warm weather, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a favorable environment, it was wonderful to see that his parents had supported him and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be fond of his youthful gifts behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Camera Mode On Me" offers a look into the untouched 1980s business. You will remember poetry, music and fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the trip back to the memory lane was welcome. No. The dance of synchronizing his individual lips is priceless and is promoted by T-shirt Frankie Goes To Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Movies are dark subjects at the right time. Child abuse, the Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social dysfunction. There is no childhood in very concerned, and the way Stein deals with these subjects is mildly interesting, and funny to look at you. <br /> <br /> Watch as soon as it suits you!
