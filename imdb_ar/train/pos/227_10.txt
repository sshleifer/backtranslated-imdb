Robert Duval is a member of the Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com film database. After watching this movie, you may think that Duval's appearance is reincarnation at best. One of my favorite films I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick was a CD or there was soundtrack available. Wonderful scenery and great music are all "very realistic", especially for those who live in the South or have moved to it. This is a "real moment in time." Life continues slowly, but "outsiders do not stay."
