Anyone who has not seen anything like the fighting scenes at The Matrix has never seen this movie. The scenes of fighting were designed by a mentally ill viewer in the animation scene Yuen Wu Ping, who also fought in The Matrix. Fighting scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Lee plays an outstanding role that does not feel pain, and now lives as a peaceful bookmaker (I've got it). When other sinister sales begin to kill local drug owners to take over the drug trade, Li cooperated with his fellow policeman to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are some very crazy things happening in this movie (one gets the badgoy on his arm parted from the glass and barely notices it). Battle scenes are filled with kicks and punches. Counting the body is the way out there. I seldom had the best, surrounded himself with a group of women who wore charming costumes (Yip kicks some donkey as a great colleague). Anthony Wong makes a headscarf as a drug lord (no surprises there; he makes a veil in every Hong Kong film). Unfortunately, they do not make films like this in the United States; I will not have to sit in all these horrible dubbing jobs to see this action I crave so much. Recommended.
