The daisies payment was a fantastic show. Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say it was created by Brian Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have much love for theater, cinema, musicals and the like will be upset. This is not a regular television program and very impressive for some. These people seem to need some linear and light tones to keep them happy. This program explodes in color, winks in old movie scenes, with Homs with stunning music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices that are made from fashion to fashion. The story takes many twists and turns, but it is all accessible because the talks revolve around love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was to end the offer and this was driven by the cancellation of the daisies. Do not deal with this as a typical TV show. Think of it as a night in the theater, then relax and enjoy!
