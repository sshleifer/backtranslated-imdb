Although badly damaged, Johnny Dangrios is one of the most famous films I have ever seen. It's a movie that needs to be watched closely; some funny shots are made to pass, and they do not have the usual attention. For example, watch the use of Michael Keaton's gun pricing in the pet store ... and also on the years of documentaries that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare movies that humor makes you unexpectedly, even though you know it's a comedy. Director Amy Hickerling is very sharp here - if you enjoy her famous films (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should give this one look. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is very lovable in starring role and supporting actors (Griffin Don, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) are excellent. Highly recommended.
