When I saw "Cry in the Dark" for the first time, I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw that, I was shocked at what I pictured. When I saw her for the second time in a semester of Australian cinema, I realized a second point: communication issues. As you can see, when a baby named Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) was abducted, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neil) were sad but did not show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, so they could mourn it. But when people across Australia saw their lack of grief, everyone began to think that Lindy had done it herself. <br /> <br /> The important point is that the erroneous message was communicated to the public, which made people opposed to Lindy. Although this was a pure accident, it did not happen. May be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of the media, regardless of the political views of any media outlet. <br /> <br /> As for the shows, Streep does a very good job in an Australian accent (not surprisingly there), and Neil's Medal is equally great. It is likely to explode as soon as you see it here. Definitely one of the best films of Fred Schepisi at all.
