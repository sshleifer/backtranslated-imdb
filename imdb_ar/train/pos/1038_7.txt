I loved the film so I loved most of its actors. But for me, Ms. Davis's experience is very weak in tone, and her harsh representation makes it very difficult to watch a convincing film. Seriously, if any other modern actress plays the same role as Mrs. Davis, she will laugh on the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she "contacted this role". Now if she plays the role of Mirna Loy or Ingrid Bergman in the role of wife, I would enjoy it much more. <br /> <br /> I think I do not get the "House of Davis". I have always thought of her as an actress "playing herself" no matter what role she plays. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many other reviewers will carefully explain (and I hope civil) in detail how I am completely wrong in this regard. But I will continue to watch the movies that appear because I love stories / writing / supporting actors, but I will always think of different actors who could have done better.
