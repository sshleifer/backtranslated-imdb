It's great how this movie goes to you. I had honest laughs. Do not bother because it's a low budget because the thing works for me. To be honest with my wife did not actually go the same way but prefer a different kind of movies. I have admitted though that it was very creative and was well placed together and probably was all on a string of shoes. These strange and troubled living characters give me something to connect to in my own world. Just hold on and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. In watching this film for the second and third time, I realized that there were some hidden moments I had experienced the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway I loved it. Hope to see more.
