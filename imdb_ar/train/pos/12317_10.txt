Masterpiece of comedy, masterpiece of horror, masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative can be said about the Chinese ghost story, the special effects may be dated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple premise: the poor debt collector must remain in an isolated area while trying to collect debt. Of course, it happens to be haunted too. <br /> <br /> What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie is that it is one of the most influential love stories I have ever seen; this without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will make you stitches. Unlike some Asian movies, it is not hard to swallow the Chinese ghost story for those who are not familiar with Chinese culture. In fact, he plays on immortal themes of cultures and romance. <br /> <br /> I think Evil Dead 2, if they had a wonderful love story in this mix. This film is real, although it has been ignored by many. It is among the best at all. The ability to combine the best aspects of multiple species and transcend cultural boundaries in order to attract humanity everywhere is no less remarkable. Highly recommended, 10/10.
