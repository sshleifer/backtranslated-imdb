I always followed Dakar, so when my husband bought a DVD home for Race to Race to Dakar, I could not wait to see it! Of course, we watched the race broadcast when the actual race was running, but that did not give the background and teams never set. <br /> <br /> If you see Long Way Round, you will not be surprised by the language I find frankly more amusing than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that bothered me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but I felt it before Dakar, so my feminine need went back to accuracy; however, "I could have lived without the" torch, "as it is I was almost crying when Charlie broke his hand and won every bruise he suffered during training .... Of course the death of Andy Caldecott ... was a terrible tragedy, but then every year there Something. <br /> <br /> Ross leads me to the nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the dialectical irony of the LWR. Now I'm in full swing with Charlie. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this Odyssey was - 1. Do not let Scorpion ever prepare your car for anything! - They had months to prepare the X5, and the day before the team left for Lisbon , The scorpion did only half the things to do, and the car was painful throughout the entire race; 2. Dakar organizers needed to do more work in the driver / driver recovery plan - leaving the dead (presumably a large number of other riders / Which they have done was not less than gross negligence; 3. Charlie has a fond enthusiasm for the "cruel and difficult" Finally, Charlie and Iwan plan for another of these epos called Long Long Down in 2007, and I can not wait to put my hands !: D If you really like cycling and / or jokes, "go ahead" You see it, and I guarantee you love. It is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for Simon Buffy - you are Sir Champion, I was very impressed by the way "quiet achievement" and the fact that you have really finished ..... just incredible given the difficult race memorial he and Charlie and Matt The rest of the team - complete marks to pull it. To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much admiration. You are all wonderful.
