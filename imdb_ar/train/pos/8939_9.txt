Robbie De and Carol Dehanhan played straight in her old age. , Tell their story in the memories of the past to Amy Hill Hirth (played by Amy Madigan), a reporter for the White New York Times. Flashback and present day scenes do not have as much inspiration as in the book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of sisters' lives are not presented, such as the background between their mother's race and the reasons behind their father's strict personality. You need to read the book to understand these things perfectly. It is also so, because the book is very cool! Apart from those flaws, they are accomplished and managed admirably, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very strong and educational film.
