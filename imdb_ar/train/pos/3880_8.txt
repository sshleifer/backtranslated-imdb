Well, for starters, this was actually the most elegant Clausen movie yet. <br /> <br /> The man has always had characters of their own humor, but I think he adds in this film an incomparable dimension to anything he did earlier. His work has been accepted - very clearly in black and white - by the broad public, but not so critical by critics. We always appreciate his sense of humor, his ability to blend with human problems and a way to let the public know what he needs to say. <br /> <br /> "Villa Paranoia, for the first time, is surprised by invisible wisdom and respect for minorities, not only ethnic people but also ordinary people in Gotland - in the country - dealing with the eternal cause of lack of love, but In a harsh and sometimes brutal manner that makes you look and keep you focused.Everybody is able to play from the real b / c who wants the right thing but has no idea how to get there and therefore people suffer bitterly. > <br /> I must say that it is one of the best films I have seen this year and I very much expect his next film.
