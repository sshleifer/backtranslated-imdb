In my work, I sometimes contact independent filmmakers trying to publish their film. When I can, take a look at these low budget films and often make me think that the future of Hollywood goes to dogs. Nevertheless, there is a film born of passion and pure desire, as if it was created to remind the film industry that good films are still possible. The short film "Broken", directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and deserves a second look. <br /> <br /> "Broken" goes on in 20 minutes, trying to tell a compelling (but surreal) story without any back story. The audience is dropped in the middle of the event with no idea what is going on. A young woman (Samantha Jin Pulai) awakes from a dream to hear a gunshot and then is abducted from her home. When you wake up, surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who seem to be at home in a comic book. These guys and girls are worse than life. They're all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> Kicker here is that, despite being a low-budget film, he does not play like one. From the beginning, the feeling was that B R O K E N was shot, edited and produced by professionals. It seems that something might have been done by Quentin Tarantino on the day of his vacation when he was crawling with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, looks good and looks like something great. <br /> <br /> Acting is much better than I usually see in these small movies. Paulie and Paul Gordon (who plays the role of killer Duncan) were chosen well. Being one of the few roles I spoke in the film, it is up to them to carry the film. There are no special effects, however good, that will save this film from misbehavior. Fortunately, Polay was able to convey real fear, and Gordon was able to emerge as a true psychologist. Some limited roles seem to be filled with less talent, but they barely appear. <br /> <br /> The downside of B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes long. The story ends with the evolution of the Twilight Zone, which seems a little intrigued and barely accurate. When I saw him, I felt like I was supposed to have some diver, but there was a feeling that it was much more mundane than I had hoped it would be. The film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that keep viewers talking for hours at a local coffee shop, but it seems unsatisfactory. I still think that this is the first 20 minutes of the long film. <br /> <br /> My ratings: 8 out of 10.
