The quote that I use for my excerpt is almost halfway through The Good EARTH, where the commander of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (Philip Ahn) is apologizing to the mob for lack of time to shoot more thieves. It was only called back to the front lines. Of course, the next thief to be discovered and shot is the main character in the film, the former slave girl of the kitchen O-Lan (won by filming Louis Reiner, 99, her second best actress Oscar). <br /> <br /> The next scene reveals that O-Lan is bringing her bag of looted jewelry to her estranged farmer Wang Long (Paul Muni), putting a classic double movement on a rising male. Mobility is the direct opposite of its moral degradation. <br /> <br /> For a film dealing with a subject including slavery, false accusations, hatred of women, starvation, domestic invasion, eating of family pets, mental retardation, murder and exploited refugees, riots and civil war, summary mass executions on the streets, marriage of relatives and beatings of children , Adultery, incest, and insecticides of biblical proportions, The Good EARTH is a heart-warming film. <br /> <br /> In another classic quote, from O-Lan itself (during the development of a valuable soup, her son just admitted to stealing an old woman into the cooking pot after the husband angrily threw Wang Long on the dirt floor across the block from their hut: Meat is flesh.
