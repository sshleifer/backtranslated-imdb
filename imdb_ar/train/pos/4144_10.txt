For a while, I was stuck in a trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself because I loved her. Greasy bus pays is the exception. It is the truth. It's the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> The "bad" of this film seems to come naturally. Halfway through the devil's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Brilliant Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a shop dress. Take the eccentric couple who continues to try to kill each other forever on the walk in the stairs. Jesus walks into unusual pictorial music. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his term to advise a film project for an elderly person. But it's the honesty of how bad it makes it so wonderful. You have the impression that the manufacturers knew it would be bad, but you never had to. <br /> <br /> Will never be repeated in wonder, offer Fatty. Highly recommended.
