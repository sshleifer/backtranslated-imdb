I watched this tape, then prepared it right away, saw it again and laughed twice. I highly recommend this bar to those who do not hate, but uncomfortable around transsexuals. It shows you that transistism is an advantage, not a single object. Comedy is not a single issue. This guy is brilliant. All comics must look forward to a level of candor, wit and talent.
