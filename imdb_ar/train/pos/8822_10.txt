A wonderful film in eight minutes presents an unusual mix of genre: mystery, excitement and music. In short, let us tell the story: A girl comes to a European cafeteria and then ... easily moves from mystery to narrative logic. In no time, there is no way Vivalondo can create B / W by imagination and despite (thanks to) narrower budgets. <br /> <br /> Because of the time span, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost haiku). Spain, the land of quick hair in B / W (¿remember the early Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> One must see to emphasize our faith in young cinema outside the United States.
