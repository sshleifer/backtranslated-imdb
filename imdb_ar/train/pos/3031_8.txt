It would have been better if he had been directed by someone with greater experience. Schumlin did not do a bad job, but it is not a great work of film art. <br /> <br /> However, it is a beautiful movie. I've loved it since I used local channels to show it. Graham Green is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some bad films were made from his novels and stories. (Many people like "The Fallen Idol" but I'm not one of them.) I think I saw "Brighton Rock" a few years ago and I was impressed, but maybe I think about it very well.) That's great. Charles Pu'er does, correctly, come across Spanish. But he seems to enjoy the perfect temperament of this character - tired, cautious, caring. Lorraine Bacall attracts the British girl in front of him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Pacino is excellent. Its performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I'm back to the director. Peter Laurie, whom we first met because he gives a lesson to Boer in a universal language similar to Esperanto, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> Wanda Hendrix may break the most difficult heart. She comes early in her early teens. Personal want to be useful. She is doing her best. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reservation is, in the first place, it is a bit solid. But the story and the behavior can not be improved.
