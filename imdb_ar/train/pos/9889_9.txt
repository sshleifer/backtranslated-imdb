Read Eric's review again. I have described this feeling to the film more eloquently than ever before. I just write here to encourage you more to search for it and see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen him for many years on TV, I think IFC. It is a unique film and I hesitate to make comparisons. Filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless rugged terrain of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Dornagu, Mexico (for John Wayne movies) in Sedona, but it is a truly barbaric place. I have to find the novel now to check the original location of the story. Like the site, this movie is strange, mysterious, fantastic, strange and not at all for everyone. This kind of production is what encourages me almost to study the film. <br /> <br /> I have not forgotten this film already, it is indelible. However, over the years, you have forgotten their existence. I do not know anyone who saw him, never read it, and saw no sign of it. Erendira is an unusual name, so I forgot the title. Well, I'll look for a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since its publication, I have become a great admirer of Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, so I'm sorry I have not read it before. <br /> <br /> As for MsMyth's comment below, the film was filmed in Mexico but the author is Colombian and did not comment on the history of Mexico or Mexico in any way, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying hard to find a copy of this movie for my library. did you like the movie? You have to read the story and then write everything else. By the way, the original site was in the Columbia story.
