Wildly, Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death at the age of six on the night of Halloween in 1963; on October 30, 1978, he fled a mental institution and set a new era of terrorism in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being followed all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Plains) who knows exactly how evil this young man is. <br /> <br /> It starts violently, setting a suspicious and distorted atmosphere in the air, in fact surpassing the many slanted images that helped inspire it. It's accurate compared to many bad blood baths that those subsequent films were; subtle, and frightening. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated views. How many movies do you already have, which can go on in terror even after someone has seen them before? Not too much. <br /> <br /> Latifa is wonderful in what may be the final role of his career. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first film appearance, became a good-humored Queen of Screaming after her "Halloween" as well as some of the subsequent slippery images, a deliberate victim worthy of rooting. <br /> <br /> Co Writer / Director John Carpenter knows what works in this film, taking advantage of shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after dark. Through this picture, he and his former assistant Debra Hill invented a privilege that led to the emergence of seven comics, many imitators and a re-imagining of the future. <br /> <br /> It is highly quoted - who would have forgotten Dr. Chetav Pleasence, in which Michael Myers described the leader (Charles Sebers, a trusted player in many previous Carpenter works)? <br /> <br /> It's great, and worth searching for. This is my favorite film John Carpenter of all time. <br /> <br /> It is not completely infallible - there are holes in the text, but in general, a strong impact occurs. <br /> <br /> 9/10
