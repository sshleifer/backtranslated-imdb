De Sica became one of my favorite managers, but that was for me. The smiling young man becomes the leader of a group of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and fascinating story about the innocent poor masses, full of evil capitalists and happy police with the trigger, but slowly evolving into a magical fairy tale, while the boy asks Tutu to develop unlimited powers. Got it here with Tutu always smiling after 10 minutes and when he took over the magic, I left in the dust. There were a lot of great staged shots, and a lot of good characters among the settlers, so much so that I kept thinking that it was a waste because the film was no more dangerous with its material. The juxtaposition of neural realism and imagination as an experiment of the kind of "look what we can do as well" rather than a very sophisticated work / art piece.
