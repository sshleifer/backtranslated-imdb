"Full House", in my opinion, is a classic ABC absolute! I'm not sure if I have not seen each episode before, but I still enjoy it. One of my favorite episodes is the marriage of Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Laurie Lovlin). If you want to know how to make it funny, you have to see it for yourself. It has two parts, so you have to see both parts. One of my other favorite episodes is the closing of Jesse, Stephanie (Judy Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) at a fuel station on Michelle's birthday. You should also see it yourself if you want to know how it happened and why. I have many other things that I like too. Everyone was always doing well, the production design was amazing, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although you can see it in the guild now, I strongly recommend taking it if it stops working well.
