White Man + Progress + Manufacturing = BAD. First Nations + Nature + Animals = Good. Simple formula. In fact, in the past days, the same kind of propaganda has been used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. However, I believe that the film succeeds in overcoming the politicization of the hijacker because it meets the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that attracts everyone. Along with the film's editorial review of how the West is winning, it may not be lost. But anyone can feel a sense of longing for days when horses can run free in the western plains. (The film also avoids the fact that there were no horses in America before the wicked white man brought them). Anyway, I loved it. Quality Animation - Especially Shot Open - Incredible.
