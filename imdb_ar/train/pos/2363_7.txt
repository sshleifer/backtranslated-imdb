This adaptation of the short story of MR James "A View From A Hill" was first shown on British television in 2005, on BBC 4. I saw it a bit. Go, remember the successful BBC adaptations of the 1970s from Mr. James' other stories, including "Whistle And I Come To You My Lad" and "Signalman". Although they are not in the same category as these antiques, the "View from the Hill" is often a fun and exciting drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives at a small rural village to see a collection of the recently deceased collector of antiques. While in the countryside, Deira was in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with the old pair of binoculars and the heinous legend about the named gallows? What does the country's flooded country and its servant know about the situation? Although I was not scary in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and the run time was longer than 40 minutes, it was a really great adaptation. As it is, everything feels a little rush and more show to adjust the mood will be welcome. <br /> <br /> Give it 7 out of 10.
