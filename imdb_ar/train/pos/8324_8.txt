This is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matau, and his friends play a match with his niece Meg Ryan and talented auto mechanics Tim Robbins. The interaction between these key roles is enhanced through a wonderful support team of well-known personal actors. This movie is nice and fun ... "Good Sense"! Hearty recommendations.
