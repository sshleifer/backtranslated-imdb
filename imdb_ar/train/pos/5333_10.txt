How did this film become a cult I do not know. I think it was unfortunately overlooked as a truly ingenious comedian! <br /> <br /> Runaway Car tries to pass itself as a fast-paced movie, but with good behavior (good God bad), the story, the practical aspects of possession of the satanic car and the child's evacuation scene in mind, there is nothing you can do Only laughter. And will laugh. Movies are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they can be an indicator of the value of the film. I laughed from this film to its climax in entertainment. At one point I felt shortness of breath and stifled me, it's really funny at some points. When the child was airlifted from the sunroof in a separate location by a helicopter with an automatic pilot that managed to maintain a constant speed similar to the car and a perfectly flat flight, which meant that the hook of the hook did not tear the car roof into pieces, I laughed hysterically. But when the child started swinging into the air, almost bumping into the bridge and the rut in the tree, the tears were pouring down my face. <br /> <br /> It also happened to me that the black policeman was the man who played Jesus in the video "Like A Prayer" for Madonna. It seems to be reaching everywhere.
