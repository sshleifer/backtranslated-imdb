I was waiting to see this movie from a long time. Boredom gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I found it was good. Most traditional romantic films end after the devotees finally marry or start a happy life after marriage but there is really a major adjustment necessary for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and a new life. This is what this film is about when a newly married couple, Fardeen and Asha, get married in a arranged marriage and begin their honeymoon life. Representation is really a spell binding though I think that a living has remained a bit quiet and that it can use some fonts for itself. The story was well knit and the dialog boxes were fairly appropriate. The process of editing and direction was also good. Meghna Gulzar did a good job here. To summarize, I would say it's a good drama love story, a real mix of what Bollywood can offer for clean entertainment.
