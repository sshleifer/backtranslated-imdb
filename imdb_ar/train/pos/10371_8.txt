It is a very powerful story-film based on reality and can cause anger to be seen. I say this because, to what extent can the press be a savage pursuit of people? In this case, an innocent Australian couple has been charged with murdering their child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of appreciation for her performance when this film appeared but I thought Sam Neil was good. Let's just say that both were excellent but the role was more difficult for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (I learned it well, I had difficulty understanding it in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, all I can say is that this movie will destroy you emotionally.
