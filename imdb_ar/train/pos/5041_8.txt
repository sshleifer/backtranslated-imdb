Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for client Wesley Doyle (Bowers Booth) in his FBI office. Claims to have information about a serial killer chased by the FBI. When Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is his dead brother. The client asks Doyle some evidence, and tells the man his life story, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his father was the widow of Mix (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his two brothers gather and tell them that the angel of God has just visited him and entrusted his family with the destruction of demons. What happens next is one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and watched yesterday again, now on DVD. Despite being a low-budget film, the film scenario is extremely sharp without any drawbacks. The cast is wonderful, but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary in the role of the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role played by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is fantastic. There is no apparent violence in this horror film. Great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title for this film: "A Mão do Diabo" (Devil's Hand). If at least "the hand of God", it may be acceptable. But describing this film as "the devil's hand" is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, screenwriter, did not deserve this lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
