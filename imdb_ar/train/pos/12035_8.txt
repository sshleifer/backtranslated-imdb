I recently stumbled across this TNT movie five minutes later while I was on vacation in Florida ... (Should there be some time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart with any length of features. Movie on TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" was not really old, was it? <br /> <br /> But I hung up and was quite surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as Jennifer Gold in an excellent way. The supporting cast (Nick, her ex boyfriend con, Karen, her best friend, her dominant parents for life) added a great deal of credibility. The twisting in the end was a nice closure of this story for a girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
