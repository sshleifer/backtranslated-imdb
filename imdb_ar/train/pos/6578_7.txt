Ironically, a play is not available in the film or video for a long time. ARMS has been on stage for many years since it first appeared in 1894 - in part because of its inspirational advance with a strong satire on Nature. Of the tournament and the act of war. The more the world sinks into strife, the ARMS seems to be rising more than ever before. <br /> <br /> This is the play that Oscar Strauss (leaving most of the best of Shaw's ideas) turned to the successful operetta, the chocolate soldier (when Hollywood arrived, * excluded the last vestiges of Shaw instead of paying for their rights) Oscar winner at his right). Although the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and dialogue rather than his bare plots, the plot also shines in ARMS, while the director runs happy endings for all involved. <br /> <br /> Young Rina (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of an officer and the richest man in her hometown, is being addressed to a police officer in the Bulgarian cavalry and everything seems to be fine until a swollen Swiss horde (Pip Torrens on the other side climbs) As usual, in Shaw's spelling, there is nothing as apparent for the first time and societal conventions stand on their heads in the light of a simple reason - not simply that there are no "good men" or "bad men", only People from a variety of classes get their best intelligence - just like the best life only - and of course with Shaw, the wit is done In 1932, a film version of Shaw's special theater satire, the most traditional and traditionally funny, was one of the first to achieve real success on this side of the film. The Shaw has never sold screen rights to his plays - licensed only for 5-year periods, and it seems that with rapidly evolving sound technology, making the 1932 films seem primitive after only a few years, Shaw has not renewed the license to show them. As a result, we strongly condemn the BBC for finally releasing the 1987 version in a DVD box with nine other sparkling plays. (Unfortunately to a certain extent, PYGMALION, seen by many as the best Shaw, does not offer good success in this collection in production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even the couple, His DVD, with the least impressive film, is a man of arms, an arm and a man making a real treasure. <br /> <br /> After cutting her teeth on televised roles like this, Helena Bonham Carter followed a great film career that would bring many viewers to this early role. They should not be disappointed, because Mrs. Carter is performing in line with the audiences of innocence that viewers expect, but under the supervision of James Sullen Jones to a certain extent (and despite the material physical production and the BBC's BBC) Reduced in the last quarter) are calculated by only 80% of their potential. <br /> <br /> The same can be said of the real star of the piece, Pip Torrens, such as Bluntschli "Switzer". It is a wonderful and attractive performance, but it does not fit the implicit physical comedy in the early scene where the young soldier can not stay awake despite his deadly danger. <br /> <br /> Despite these reservations, this powerful reservation produced a wonderful play that was transferred to the small screen with aplomb. It deserves to be widely seen, and ideally, a new large screen, vibrant and new-style version of Wilde's AN IDEAL HUSBAND. Almost * any * weapon * and man should cherish, and with a lot of luck, maybe we will eventually get to the original 1932 version. Even one of the other surfaces, this production will satisfy any person who likes Xu well.
