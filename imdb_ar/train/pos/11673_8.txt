After seeing Charlie Burman on a long tour with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested in seeing how Charlie would be in his own show. I thought Charlie had come across as a beautiful man based on the ground. It is nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it is only their flesh! I do not know much about bicycles, but this offer bothered me from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems enormous. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am intrigued to see why Charlie and everyone else do this and to what extent. I love the pace of the show and the music is upbeat quickly. I can not believe he broke the collarbone, I really hope not to be the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
