"The Groove Tube" was initially featured on the video, in the first "video theaters" here in Boston. In one room, there were TV screens on high platforms, with old cinema theater seats, in small groups facing the displays. There were old refrigerators filled with Pepsi, and York's mint pancakes baskets. In a smaller second room, there were no seats, only large cushions. That was a "smoking" room, in other words, people up there. This action was added only to the joy of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent viewer"; most of the scenes I liked and remember so far are: Coco The Clown, The Crump Family Kitchen (Crump Easy Loop Shorting), Safety Sam / VDSA, Chevy Chase Hitchcaker W / Naked pass through the jungle, Pallet Finger what was eventually revealed to be naked body of women. The last element was very reminiscent of Ernie Kovacs. Now, I have lost many readers under the age of 48 ("Who is Ernie Kovacs?") But trust me, it's funny. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I made "frequent scenes" was that I and my friends brought other virgins from Groove Tube to see it. We sat quietly watching the "virgins" as PSA "Safety Sam". When you slowly push the camera on "Sam", wait for it "OH!" Of recognition on the face of "Virgin". Every time it was more hilarious than the past. Then the "virgin" will attend a friend to watch the show, and repeat what we did. To get this joke, you should see the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some are dated, but most plays, movies, television and now are videos. Look only at any video produced in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" in the theater as a movie, a grainy transfer from the original video. It was cut, missing some of the original highlights. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, sparked instant reviews, "This is the guy from The Groove Tube, so it was an introduction to the Chevy series. <br /> <br /> I can not look at a box of shortcuts without hearing the audio, "Prepare your hands with a large amount of Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening ..." and think about the recipe "Kramp Holiday Loaf". It always makes me laugh in the Baking Needs arcade in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 1970s were fraught with danger. "The Groove Tube" was new and new and had a "Humor of the Age". He introduced a "vibrant generation," humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
