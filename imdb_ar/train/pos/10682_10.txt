A few years ago, the channel promoted U.K. Gold space to repeat "men acting badly" with the hype: "Ha ha, the original sitcom to share flat!". This was actually not true. Man Around the House was also a common jigsaw puzzle and was run from 1973 to 1976. It was the brainchild of Johnny Mortimer and Brian Cook, the creators of the famous sitcom "Dear Father." When it was over, they decided they wanted to do something more in tune with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) arrange their apartment at Myddleton Terrace after a wild party when they find a man in their bathroom. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a student at Southampton School of Homeless Cooking. While drying his clothes, wearing a women's dress and prepare a meal. They admire his cooking skills so much that he invites him to stay. But there must be no naughty work. So Robin must pretend to be an idiot ... <br /> <br /> In "Love 1973" on BBC 2, which appeared in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that "The House" showed her an enviable way of life on her. She was not alone. One of the most iconic images (for me, anyway) of British television in the 1970s was Sally Thompson coming out of the London Underground with an umbrella, while a "blind" man does a double job while swinging her swinging bottom. <br /> <br /> The man who lived with two girls was a time-consuming subject, but Mrs. Whitehouse did not need warmth under the collars, she was innocent and good fun. Mortimer and Cook's scripts approached as far as possible from reaching the edge without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan was still playing "Pinguam" in the film "The Doctor in Charge" when he started. In fact, the second round of "in charge" overlapped with the first of the "House". Born to play Robin Crazy. The song "Chrissy" was released by Paula Wilcox in the direction of the street more than "Beryl", and her character played in "The Lovers", while the song "Jo" to Sally Tomset petrified. Over time, he became like a big brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Joetha Joyce stole the show as the warriors Robbers. George lost interest in sex, but Mildred did not. They continued their own show - George and Mildred. The late Doug Fisher was of good value as a friend of Robin Liddoy. He has been working well and has become a regular game. <br /> <br /> Within a year of his debut, there was an inevitable film spin-off. I'm not a big fan of "Man for the House" because I think it was extended to fit the big screen. Most of her characters never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> Co-ordination was sold to America, where it became the long-running "Three Company" of the late John Ritter and Susan Summers. It was more obvious than British origin, where Somers is often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> Six seasons later, 'The House' ended with the marriage of Krissy of Norman's older brother Norman (Ashley). Fans were ruined to see Robin failed to get the girl she loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he also landed his own program - "Robin's Nest".
