I've seen this movie more than once. He was on par with many of the scary things that were appearing in the TV movies at the time. The only problem I encountered was the title for obvious reasons ... one immediately thinks of the famous snack cake by Drakes! If we leave the first part, "Hound of Hell" is enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is always able to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But this was an enjoyable Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna made a trip to a mysterious country to find the mystic who would help him overcome the evil monster. The taxi driver asks how to find this man. A great dialogue between the original taxi driver and Crenna in terms of cabby distorted the ethnic beliefs of his people. "Excuse me, Mr. Barry, I left these things behind me when I came down from the mountains ..." - in reference to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one really knows how to communicate with him. <br /> <br /> With regard to supernatural fare, this movie is still fun.
