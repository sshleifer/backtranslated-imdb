This appears to be the second version of this film, which was filmed before in 1911 and 1918. It reminds me in many ways of the last film, YANK AT OXFORD. Both films relate to a knockout hit to one of the best schools in the world and both eventually show hard learning slowly about teamwork and fitness. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival "Bob" played by Francis Bushman. In a supportive role, Jack Beckford - always remembers that he is Mary's brother. Of these three, Beckford is at his best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes a friend of Tom - already has some decent scenes in addition to an exciting moment just before the big game! All the usual cliches are present and the film, because it has been done many times before and since then, offers some surprises. However, it is a wonderful movie and fun scenes. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better silent university film, try Harold Lloyd's The Frishman - more exciting and frankly funny football scenes from Harold and sympathetic to Tom Brown's spam. FRESHMAN may be the best university image you can find in that era. Another reason is that William Haines played essentially the same unwanted character and bombs in the same plot again and again (as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others) - and if you've seen one of those movies, you've all seen them . Well made, but definitely not original! And because it is just a reworking of his other films, anyone who gives the film a grade of 10 is strongly advised to watch these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I've reviewed and just watched this little movie was the top rated film on IMDb since 1920 !! We're talking about being overrated! There are dozens and dozens of best films - how this film became number one is guessing anyone.
