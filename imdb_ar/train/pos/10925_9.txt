I really love this movie. I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire it. I suppose this is one of my criteria for a great film. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. Give us 6 characters. Each one has a very unique and extremely deadly kung fu style. Each of these characters is trained by the same teacher but their identity is kept secret from each other. The dying teacher sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to correct the mistakes he suspects of some of his students. <br /> <br /> How will the other student find other toxins? How will any of them know bad? The way you answer these questions is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also see poisons fighting each other in each group. It is interesting to see how their patterns correspond to each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to know if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. Do not get better than this.
