A unique film ... one of the best films ever made. Acting, scenario, degree, Quincy Jones, cinematography, editing, etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on the book by Truman Cabot about the famous killing of the Clutters family by two young men during a misguided robbery. I have never seen a movie about the real story brilliantly to a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Actors are strong in all areas, but the focus is on killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team that haunts them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. He is arrogant, energetic, and without empathy. He is very charming, fat and reasonable. Robert Blake as Berry Smith is also unusual - lonely, at the same time sympathetic and cold blooded. Who can fold these properties into one individual and make us buy them? He does, he is awesome! The main point of this book is how the intersection of these two socially different people took a great deal of time to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and hideous crime, and these two actors make them work beautifully. Each had moments in his later career, but these performances are high watermarks, and this represents the representation period. <br /> <br /> The police are also wonderful. The investigation leads John Forsythe, but the other three investigators are also wonderful. Unlike contemporary films where producers feel it is necessary to provide the police with supernatural assets or weaknesses, these are just real flat feet designed and efficient. Looks very real. I have not seen police on the screen very strong in their health; I have seen most of the criminal classics go back. Really one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> The upcoming PARTIAL SPOILER (this movie is unique in that you already know what happened, but I am wary of the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best crime and film shows are interrogations - the intellectual fencing matches between police and fraudsters, Manu Manu. This film contains the best scenes of interrogation you'll see in the movie. Dick and Perry watched as they tried to fool their way and slowly disintegrated, unaware that the police had the goods on them. But the police need to carefully prepare the suspects to break the alibis and hopefully get confessions. This is some of the best representation you'll ever see. Glengarry thought Glen Ross was under showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and appalling angles of this real story, the ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I have heard that Clutters are played by film students to give them a real sense. it's working. These look like a decent, simple folk. It makes the crime clear and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. It's not a great movie, but it's one of the best films ever produced, and it's unique, it's a mandatory show for every film buff.
