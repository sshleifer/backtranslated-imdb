This is one of my best favorite songs. <br /> <br /> If there is a drawback in the movie, it comes to you like a raging bull. Does not involve the viewer as much as he attacks him. '' Scarface '' is a sinister and inexhaustible production like Tony Montana himself. There is nothing left for the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> The weaker Moroder scenario fits the procedure to the tee. Like the choir in a Greek tragedy, it bends and catches, and catches the locomotives, a constant reminder of Tony's ruthless fate. Torn across the screen with an unstoppable force from a runaway train.
