Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gina Roland performs a stunning performance for a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. Trying to escape from her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the ghost of death for a little girl. Self acceptance, and the human condition, despite its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallels between the drama series and the film itself are puzzling: it seems as if the theater has become a way out of heroin. If all American films can only be of high quality, they deal with human relationships at the adult level, and do not try to blow and unite feelings ... It is one of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
