I first saw this film about 11 years ago when it was recommended by a former accounting professor at the college. I was surprised that a 1968 film could capture the computer crime in a coherent and fun way. Maggie Smith is delighted and Ostinov plays the role of "retro pirate" ideally. "O Nolo Mio" !!!!!
