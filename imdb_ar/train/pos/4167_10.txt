The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a really good movie. He acts well by actors including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. Music is nervous and gives a diabolical cold! I liked the influences on the dog and I think that the creature itself looked really great with its horns, as a gift part of it on his neck, and he was really blushing! If you like horror movies and have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and be able to find this rare movie and buy it, then do it because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll disappoint me!
