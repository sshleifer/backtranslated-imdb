The "inspirational" stories about "the triumph of the human spirit" are usually great spells for me. The most amazing thing about men of honor is how much I enjoyed myself though. The film is predictable and vulgar as it gets, but it works. Much of the credit goes to the delightful performance of both prospects. It is an ideal role for Cuba Gooding Jr., which has been beautifully restricted here. We have expected a lot from De Niro, and he does not disappoint me. It creates a funny image darkly. Director George Tillman Jr made an old-fashioned flick and came with a winner.
