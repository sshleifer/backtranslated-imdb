The greatest film is Pressburger and Powell. David Neffin plays the role of the Royal Air Force bomber pilot who missed his death but was given a second chance of life when he noticed that AWOL was sending an angel to investigate. The scene in which young soldiers, men and women, in black and white, who were all killed during the fighting, arrives in paradise to be addressed for eternal life, unbearably influential. Also watch out for Roger Lipsy, the highly regarded actor, and Kim Hunter as a love lover (later, of course, Zira in the Planet of the Apes). By the way, Steven Spielberg filmed the actress who played the role of the principal Angels (Kathleen Byron) as an elderly wife of the private sector called "Save the Soldier Ryan" half a century later, a work on volumes for the eradication of film illiteracy.
