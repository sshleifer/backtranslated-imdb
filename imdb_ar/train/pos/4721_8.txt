Sad story of the pilot dropped by 17. Brady was shot down over the occupied territories. Local shepherds have extended kindness and protection at the expense of their own lives. I have never heard of this film and it has been interrupted for two hours. After the film ends, I'm glad I took the time. It is an entire story told to illustrate the shape on Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
