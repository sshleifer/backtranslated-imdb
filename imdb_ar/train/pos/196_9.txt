This to me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davis. It's not only gorgeous but hilarious in this movie. (I think Lucille Paul may have designed her career later in the Davis style, which could be called "beauty of Zani"). The Fedor's direction is light but sure, the story is of course chestnut but the acting is wonderfully contemporary, and adds a star-watching element to the silent-time lovers, with many engravings, to general fun. It combines the slap elements with adult drama and old timeless romance very well. For all movie lovers who react to watching silent movies, sit in this movie and may change your attitude. <br /> <br />
