Tommy Jones and Matt Dillon make the world of gambling proud. It was necessary to learn the different moves with the wrists because throwing the crap was a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As much as we feel today, I fully expected that the "good girl" would cry over his grave, rather than his girlfriend. Especially with her remarks about "going to the funeral of her best friend" when she met Matt for the first time. And then, of course, Matt expects to kill the man who threw the battery acid in the face of Mr. Allen, and he smacks it (an interesting role Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of Hollywood's other ends are happening, but the writing is very excellent, so be careful so that you are not happy. <br /> <br /> The music is out of this world. We return to the fifties of the last century when the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley "our original passion". Even a little bit of racism cuts its ugly head in Chicago, but in a wonderful club called "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag that supports racism. I'll see it again, just to hear the music. Something good that I have a FACTOTUM sound track, so I can hear it in the car. See both of them together, and you'll see how Matt died .... playing bar room characters in both. Although he has a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York City, he is likely to have a great opportunity to do his studies. Great representative, just going out to town. It shows accurate performances accurately ... good and evil in his characters. His "little boy outside the farm" is a wonderful study, made especially impressive because of his eyes wearing the bass. He makes love, also convincingly. Since he was in many films with Teen Diane Lane, I wonder how it was ... a love for an actress who grew up on her. Adds conviction, I will say so.
