Louis Sacher's disguised classics for children revolve around Disney like Freddie Krueger. You've got murder, racism, facial mutilation and deadly lizards. <br /> <br /> It has been carefully planned, a multi-layered and interconnected story spanning history to reveal Stanley's legacy and the secret behind the holes. They race from the greenish green of Latvia to Camp Green Lake with a pock mark (hint: no lake or green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is to recreate novel environments convincingly - the design of the collection is superb and without gloss. Plus other casting. Rising star Chea LaBeouf (Charles Angels 2, Green Light Project) may not be the fat boy in the book, but his position is right and far from the usual hero. The rest of the cast is filled equally well, by Patricia Arquette as a thief turned into a school teacher turning to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is pop music soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the feeling turned to full size in the end.
