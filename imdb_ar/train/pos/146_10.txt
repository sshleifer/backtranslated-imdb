I came to the end of this and I almost screamed, "No, no, no, no, you can not end here, there are a lot of unanswered questions, involving dishwashers, Mina Husseleb's disappearance?" "coma"? Little brother saved by his father? What about the head ??????? I then read that at least two of the team members have passed and I must say, I know it probably will not be true to see Lars von Trier, but I would be happy to look for alternate representatives just to see the end has planned! On someone to play Helmer as well as deserve personal ... Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have not yet seen a more self-indulgent, obscure personality, and an avatar on the screen! I know how it ends!
