Very good start. I was a bit surprised when I found the mechanism very undeveloped: it should have been more distorted, to match our view in the original series. The cast is interesting, although Lady Vulcan encounters it as a very small person. She needs a school on Spock, which is, after all, the model of this race. Too bad they could not choose Jerry Ryan. I love Ms. Park, the Korean lady (?). The doctor has odds. The other males, except the black man, were not sorted. He's really loved. Bakula needs to find his place - at QL his strong point of view was his sense of humor and his willingness to experience anything. It is, of course, big and strong enough for the tournaments. The heavens were fine, although I did not like their makeup.
