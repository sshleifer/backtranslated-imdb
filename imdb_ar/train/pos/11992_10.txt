Since I remember, I loved airplanes and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot license and am looking forward to becoming commercialized. I never remembered why I was so obsessed with the subject that the old Tail Spin strips bumped into the basement of the house and hit me. My parents bought every bar they had and this was the only show I had seen as a child. I had a subject to memorize and I grew up and can still mention it today. It's very amazing and I plan to buy DVDs soon! It is really a wonderful thing for kids and adults and is never without. I can not get enough of this show.
