It may be interesting (or not) that the only reason I made this film in the first place is that I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in its CASABLANCA (10/10 role in the best actor Oscar) I will still give But Paul Lucas did a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I saw this movie, because I enjoyed it a lot. I think the film might be a little promising, but not only was I not an artist, I enjoyed the speeches and I did not feel Bored with them. <br /> <br /> The acting was great in this film, and Lucille Watson (rightly nominated for the Oscars) And the House of Davis (mistakenly not nominated), and George Colores, and strange, Eric Roberts, who plays the role of the Middle Child ... The philosopher ... he just cracked me, and even the name of the characters (Bodo) funny. <br /> <br /> , In which Lukas was forced to do something he thought was wrong even though he was doing it for the right reasons, and he also worked with me, agreeing to why he felt he was doing what he did, and understanding why he could not explain it completely. Good and noble, the scene (home sense) is beautiful, the representation is excellent. Watch this movie if you get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
