I remember walking on my way to Spain at the age of 25, getting a lift, and what turned out to be two fleeing Italian scammers. They were doing so much outside the law, but on the other side they were carrying a small picture of Jesus in the pocket to protect them ... just and unfair, good and bad, criminal and true where here in a new group, outside the classes I used to know. Les Valseuses, despite the film and not real life, gives me a picture close to my own experience: the intensity of each moment as soon as you leave behind and go forever, no matter how you come your way, it is another state of mind and also a form of "Dangerous" forms of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready to do so and who want to persecute you for "theft" and so on. This film touches on "values." It is a story about "what is right and wrong": morality. It is a resurrection of the individual who fights himself against "false morality" and matching ... There is danger along the way, because how far can you go with your own "freedom" and beyond your moral limits alone? What do you do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot you for things you do, like "stealing" some gasoline from a multinational oil company for your fifth-hand car? Les Valseuses revives these questions in me, because ethics, in contrast to the usual "media message", is very complex ...
