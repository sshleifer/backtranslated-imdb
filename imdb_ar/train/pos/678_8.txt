The first international success of Peter Ware, the recent wave is essentially an effective cooler with a wonderful background story based on the legend of the indigenous people. Richard Chamberlain performs well as a lawyer to defend his life becoming increasingly unstable as he delves into a murder case involving indigenous tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlain through the Dreamtime world, a reality / alternate schedule of Australian original history and tribal customs. Drowned in the atmosphere, ambiguous in conspiracy, the film builds on a worrying conclusion that is somewhat diminished by its bad effects, probably because of budget constraints. However, it is an intriguing film, which will keep the general impression of the mystery and horror that lies beneath the surface of what we see as "reality."
