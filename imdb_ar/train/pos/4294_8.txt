There was no drought among the public yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema after seeing the jewel from a movie in a house that was sold as part of the Hamburg Film Festival this year. The tears were all shedding laughter. This film was a joy, and there is no other way to say this. There was not one dull thing in it, and I laughed with each other of us three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alan Sharp was very impressive. A clown is big if necessary and dangerous if the situation calls for it. The performance was of course quite high, but that was exactly what the story needed and what made it work well. Equally so was Charlotte Ginsburg, whom I loved to see so much, and the mother was also very strong. The sisters could have been more elaborate in the literal text, but apart from that, there is nothing to mention. I had a great time watching this film while Hamburg was drowning in the rain outside, and I hope that films like this from France will be on a regular show in Germany. But the distributors are that this country does not seem to understand that the French are making good films. I can not wait at least to find a DVD that offers subtitles (hello Australia? Please?) Because I need this film at home to watch it several times!
