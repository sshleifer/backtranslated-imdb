I saw this day with my 8 year old. I thought it was nice. I agree with the other poster that I can not remember anything like the book, but we still enjoy it. All children are very good and entertaining. Billy is a new kid who accepts the audacity of bully school to eat 10 worms a day. If lost, he has to walk into the school hall with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film was set to show that Billy suffers from severe stomach ache and pain in almost anything. It follows hilarious with a variety of different ways to cook worms. Good message about standing on the wits and of course happy happy ending.
