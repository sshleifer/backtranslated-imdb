Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I watched this movie: "For the First Time" with Korin Korky Nemik. It was the story of Michelle and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the most important love song scene in the Micheal bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy, this movie has not been programmed for many years and I do not know how to find the song. Thank you so much for helping me! I love this movie! It is very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Sheryl Pollack! Jessica
