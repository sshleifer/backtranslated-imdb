When my 14-year-old daughter meets with her friends on a night of film, one film insists on watching it again and again: I guessed that, the K-911, the third installment of the highly successful K-9 franchise, Belushi. <br /> <br /> People, you know it was possible to wear a VHS tape, but a DVD?! This was played so often that he began to skip; no joking! But of course you will have that when you have a very charming, wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Of course, we should thank the only person and Tom Hanks for our definition of the beloved Cop-Dog. With turner and hush. However, even this film does not amount to absolute excellence in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some great people say that Belushi ran out with this third film in the series. Poppycock, I say. Although you may suspect that a third release - direct to the video - may not seem worth watching, you prove that you are wrong after watching this good movie. <br /> <br /> I will not get rid of this plot, but I will say that Belushi and his partner are giving their best performance so far - which will make you laugh! It is a shame that John Bluche is not alive to see the great steps his brother has taken in the world of acting. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that your teenage daughter present this movie to BFFs at her next concert in Slippet. Do not forget the puppy Chau!
