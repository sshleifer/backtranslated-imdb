In fact I liked this film very much. Not because of the plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it, because it is one of the worst movies ever created. Very bad, very bad, so it becomes terribly funny. Some jokes are really wonderful, but the rest make me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter. "White men" are stupid and stupid, so you can not do two things. Turn off the TV or wrap it on the floor laughing (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
