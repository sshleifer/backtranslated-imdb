After reading some totally negative reviews for this film, I was not sure if I should get some money to rent it. However, they were pleasantly surprised. I have not seen the original film, but if it's better, I'll be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise offers a strong performance as a seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than just a smile on his legs (for the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia born on July 4). Penelope Cruz is fairly light-weight, but it fills its demands in turn, as do Diaz. The only disappointment is a little cute Kurt Russell. However, in the film, acting is not really impressive - it's filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe is in the lead, giving him a quick change in the pace of his welcome from the usual Chetick. The increasing madness of the film is performed ideally by Crowe (the short sequence where Cruise walks across an incredibly blank Time Time). The soundtrack (characteristic feature of the film Crowe) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot appears to be a bit tricky, but the issues that have been explored behind it can be debated indefinitely. The film is not perfect, but its rapid change in the pace of the cruise and the microcosm and those raised on a diet of Hollywood glitter, should be a revelation.
