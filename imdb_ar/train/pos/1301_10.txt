I loved all the cream works, even if there was such a small and precious catalog that you should do. Even when they go for up to twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are notable examples), they still rock the socks for more than half of any rock work that works today. This ability to gel on stage is one of the most anticipated rock concerts ever with her performances at Albert Hall last year. They may be older, as are their fans, but energy is still there, with wonderful arrangements for classic blues songs as well as their own songs. Solo Clapton has a form that he sometimes does when he is on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker said. Jack Bruce is strong enough with his vocals still has the kind of power that Clapton could not get by himself. Bottom line, if you want to see the best deals that you wanted to watch last year (well, some may have seen it), all this is on this DVD, with great special features.
