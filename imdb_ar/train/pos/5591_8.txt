The alternative title of Ecstasy is the Love Symphony; a title that appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talk, and may be a classic film well, if released during the silent film era. This film is a visual experience, proceeding deliberately so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual musical quality, which is presented in a low-level artistic manner. The director's style is clearly European. The theme and approach to sexuality was much more complex than it was in Hollywood at the time. Consider the US Control Act, during 30, which largely sums up. Hady Lamar, one of the beautiful beauties of all time, was an ideal choice for the "Love Symphony".
