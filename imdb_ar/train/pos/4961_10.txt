Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the couple who interact in the car and perform tasks according to one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful humanist, tied to one and the other, while Paz Vega is the treasurer behind the 10 Items or Less line, which frightens customers and fills her mind. Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other. To do this, of course, they must be weak, interested in change, and have a sense of humor, and they all have. I hope this film is realistic, and I hope that this kind of story happens a lot, and I hope we do not go to the movies to realize that we can actually communicate with each other even if we came from completely different backgrounds. The film's message is based on the open heart, and makes us wonder whether there is another world where we can meet - a world in which peace can be possible.
