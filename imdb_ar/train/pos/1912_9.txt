I will keep it short and concise, and the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius, the actors are just ideal for the roles they play (legendary CJ characters) and they have a lot of chemistry on the screen which makes it a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episodes, which may be just over 6/7 months ago, I wondered what happened to Paul. I stumbled to find out that he died when I was browsing Google. He was very funny and played his character towards perfection, an overprotective father who likes to keep his daughters out of the spotlight and away from the boys. <br /> <br /> I think comedies have gone from strength to strength, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think most people will enjoy watching it.
