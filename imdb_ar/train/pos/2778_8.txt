I saw this with a few expectations and I loved it perfectly! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical film about a somewhat atypical girl. This is the prominent role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), where she plays Jess, a teenager in England caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (this is our football from North America). Although she is much older than her character, she plays an ideal role in playing. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship - specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who will also go through family issues, especially with her mother, who wears purple nail polish and small arches on her shoes, To be more feminine, wearing white lingerie and flirting with children and terrified that exercise meant that her daughter was a lesbian. Both Jules and Jess love to play the game and have problems trying to convince their families to let them pursue their dreams. Both, unfortunately, both love the same guy - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Reese Myers). Triangle love causes some pressure in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham is located in cliches. In other cases, the scenes continue for a very long time, and perhaps this film has benefited from the most compact editing. <br /> <br /> But this was a fun and enjoyable film about your upbringing, cultural conflict, and love of football. It's about empowering women, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is a little movie that can ... and did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 10/08.
