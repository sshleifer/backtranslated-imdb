I have just returned from showing my "left foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel comfortable and refreshed. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Christie Brown, the Irish writer and painter, based on the biographical biography of my left foot. Christie was born with cerebral palsy, so that the only party he had good control of was his left foot. Doctors advised his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother did not give in. As Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, she helped him make a breakthrough by learning the alphabet and then reading, writing, and painting. <br /> <br /> This film won the Academy Awards for Daniel Day Lewis (Best Actor) as well as the best Supporting Actress for the actress who plays his mother; she also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired psychiatrist and family therapist, while many movies may enjoy me, many of them often leave me to overlook the overall narratives or possibilities of realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> This film is not an "interest" at all in portraying typical Irish roles and behaviors (see, for example, the typical Irish families in Ethnic & Family Therapy) and the maturation of Christie Brown Emotional Emotional - Some of the immature personal reactions that were amplified more by picking up his father's features. <br /> <br /> The film presents the greatest truth in changing certain sequences in its development (drawing and writing) and intensifying many important people in one person, in order to tell a coherent and honest story, not burdened with small, fragmented and less important realities. (See Kristy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version we showed contains some English translations that were a great help in understanding Christie's speech (and some Irish speech); the initial release of the film may lack this. (If you see this on a DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> Daniel Day Lewis's performance is one of the most touching jobs I have ever seen. Really wonderful, fantastic, super. <br /> <br /> My "left foot" bears more resemblance to a more recent film, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly", where everyone depicts the life of a real person who has overcome prison and isolated a severe physical disability. <br /> <br /> In doing so, resonates with "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley who begins: "From the night that covers me, // Black as the hole from the pole to the pole, // I thank all gods may be / / My spirit is invincible. "
