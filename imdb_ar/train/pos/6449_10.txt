I was quoted to this movie by a friend and I was skeptical of a Swedish movie with a translation. However, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. The unnecessary cruelty that people can bear with confidence is portrayed without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a few short seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope for the tragedy has been illustrated from a new and satisfactory angle by a group of characters with very natural flaws and features. I was particularly impressed with the way in which the film managed to address various aspects of hypocritical human behavior concerning prejudice, discrimination and the sacred pretext. An absolute gem of a movie I will encourage him to hear.
