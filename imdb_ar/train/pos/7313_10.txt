Some spoilers If you're a fan of big horror movies, you'll know that Halloween has paved the way for many abandoned films. This film is often a true and never-repeated tradition, a real horror film and is certainly one of the most spectacular, if not the most terrifying, films ever. <br /> <br /> I've already watched this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other seven films before watching this film, and that's what happened. But I would say this strikes each other away. It's really scary, seeing Michael coming out from behind a bush or wandering around in the dark sending the cold down the spine. My favorite part of the film was when Michael stabbed a man, leaning his head to one side. It is one of the most beautiful images in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Later slashes, such as Friday's movies, were more fun and less intense than this one. I love the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a fearsome villain because he is realistic, you can imagine a crazy man like him revolves around killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film is that it does not rely on nonsense or humor to entertain the audience. It is just pure terror. It's very bad that the last films of the series rock from this film, because this is a great example of an impressive film when it comes.
