This film was very decent original, courageous movement of all involved. I do not care if it is not the most beautiful movie of all time, and the fact that Eddie Murphy is doing an opposite job, and I do not know what will happen next, makes it a favorite for me. I hope more films are creative like this video, rather than the old version of entertainment.
