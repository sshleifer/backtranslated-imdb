This movie is one of my favorite of all time. Carrie Grant, Victor McGlagen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ... What a crew. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, motion, adventure and comedy all entered into one. The scene of the last battle that continues to this day gives me chills and the result always makes me cry. If you do not see it, I will strongly recommend it.
