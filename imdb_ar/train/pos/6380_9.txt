Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better film than I thought. I never thought this film would lead to my expectations. True, the film started slowly, but with its bounce the film became more appealing to me. The story unfolds in 1914 and revolves around a man named Milo. Milo believes in the legend of Atlantis. Along with his grandfather's friends, he embarked on his own amazing adventure. Along the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The sound crew is awesome. Sure, they know how to carry movies with their audio talent only. The music is not special but lovable anyway. Animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. In general, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this 9/10 movie.
