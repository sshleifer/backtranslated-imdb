I was not huge in IMAX movies. It's great, but once you get over the initial rush, "Stop, it looks like we're flying!" The films themselves are usually vulgar and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The strong exceptions were Everest, the lively Wild California and now the BBC's Human Body, a super-sized look on the sides of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of unimaginable complexity. This 50-minute film can last up to 10 hours and still can not reach all the systems that work side by side as I write this review and listen to my radio, and most of us consider it a Muslim. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inner part of the pumping heart (similar to the alien spaceship), inside your lungs, the tiny hair in the eardrum that handles the sound, the growth of the baby inside the mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few ... or , Less attractive functions that I thought would stay away from (pimples, stomach acid scattering ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has a rather unconventional style, which distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we have all seen that sperm find their way to the egg, but have you ever seen it match the "Let's get" tone? These are creative moments like those that make the "human body" not only a healthy lesson but also fun.
