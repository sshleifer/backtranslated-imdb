I saw this film without knowing anything about it at all, and I found it similar to my theme Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on the troubled father / son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father into mines and dreams of a better life far from his hometown. Both boys face ridicule from their classmates and have a strong female model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I have found between films is that October Sky was a very interesting and enjoyable film. Laura Deren performed impressively, and Chris Cooper plays the role of a reluctant father as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his meticulous output, which is quite different from his other output features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
