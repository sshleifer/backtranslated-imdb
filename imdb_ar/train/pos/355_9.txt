I, like many horror lovers, have been forced to reproduce Hollywood with the same huge budgets and three years at MTV High School 20 years ago. Here, finally, an original horror film depicts all the correct squares. <br /> <br /> You want a hot leading actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool cars, you want blood, lots of them, by carrying a bulldozer - you've got them. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent choreography and supporting role of Queen of the Same Hammer cry Stephanie Bocham, these are really wonderful things. <br /> <br /> Despite its low budget, by choosing to use 35mm stock and adding high-quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves created something bigger. <br /> <br /> The old school must be terrorized by fans.
