Well, I do not really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they are kicking ass. They just ... run against each other. <br /> <br /> For example: close to the end of the film, Ricky and Julian are telling "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and walk. Finally, Ricky and Julian show that they are in jail for two years. In the experimental TV series, the first clip they show is the same clip as Ricky and Julian screaming in "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, they are supposed to be only in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> Also, they give us the impression that the story line in the film and the storyline in the TV series are linked (because of the screaming scene between the players). But some actors portray completely different personalities. Of course, Patrick Roche plays the role of "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in the series plays the role of Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the players who drive Ricky to annihilation, then Sam Lusco plays in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the film, men snoring coke instead of smoking fragmentation. The thing is, they did not actually confirm that the lines of the story are linked anyway, unlike the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to continue tampering.
