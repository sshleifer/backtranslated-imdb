As a senior Prince fan over the past three to four years, I can not really believe that I could only understand seeing a "Purple Rain" tour. Led the new special edition of the two-disc anniversary to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I was not prepared for how long it was already electrified. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are not limited to astonishment - he really has movements in this film. I am very familiar with the classic Purple Rain album and all his songs, but seeing it in the context of the film completely changes your perception of songs and lyrics - such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, when the doves squeak and the purple rains themselves. There is something indescribably hypnotic about the scenes of the prince and the revolution. The closing songs BABY I I STAR closed and I would die for you to show how much energy and talent the Prince was full of in his mid-20s (it's overflowing!), He blew me away. It makes Michael Jackson seem non-vital even in peak years. <br /> <br /> The prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - led to a lake, jumps out, and then runs out - very fun things late. <br /> <br /> Some scenes from the 1980s are unintentionally fun, but this adds to the film's overall fascination. Morris Day is the coolest cat in the block (and funny), and when his group The Time the BIRD, you'll see Morris Day and Jerome Benton spotlight the Minneapolis funk style - I love dancing in this part, and how Benton provides Morris with an average performance in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I already can not wait to see it again, I can not actually! The additions are fantastic - especially the vision of young Eddie Murphy before Beverly Hills cop admits to being "the prince of a group".
