Here is one really funny movie at every moment covered. How can this movie not be given the role of creative stars from South Park and directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this film, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent for acting and writing was very impressive. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that they really died and trey, later on. Humor is sometimes rude, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes wonderful, sometimes light, sometimes noisy, and sometimes stupid, but in general, this is the hell of an undoubted film, classified. Well actually, it's crazy. Totally crazy.
