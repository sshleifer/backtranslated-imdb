Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, Scarface draws a picture that can not be easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns into a staggering performance like Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee to become a powerful player in the drug world where he runs mercilessly his criminal kingdom in Florida. This gangsters are harsh, violent and noisy, gross, unpleasant and must keep a record of the word "f-k" most of the time. Nearly three hours long, and yes it can get disgusting. A solemn constitution keeps you in your seat chanting the loss of the ruthless master of crime. <br /> <br /> Also interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Stephen Power, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and F. Abraham Murray, and the Angel of Salazar. Pacino proves that he is one of his greatest generation. He managed to realize the reality of his character that left a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone to let you think you've moved away from disaster. Is this strong enough for you? Crime does not pay for a long time!
