Leave it to Brick to make a good offer. Finally, he and Zorak live their lives outside Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I must say that I love both of these shows. They are exactly what the adults started swimming. Brak achieved great success with an album released in 2000. He may not have been platinum, but his show was really popular with many people who like Adult Swims. I must say that among all the adult shows to swim without any plot, this must be the offer that is unprecedented. That's why I liked it so much, it's just a classic game in adult swimming history. I think this is just a fantastic show, if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons of hates and tons I love.
