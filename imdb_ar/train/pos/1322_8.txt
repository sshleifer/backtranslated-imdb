What a wonderful movie. Even if they were not built on real life, Forbidden Lies was a wonderful image of an artist con in her element. A kind of film psychology students can learn to learn more about compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, has been revealed as a media fraud, but this move really gives her a great chance to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns you take in the documentary maker are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie I did not read the book but I heard good comments and went to see it on a boring boring afternoon. The journey that takes you out of this movie is smart, interesting and completely enjoyable.
