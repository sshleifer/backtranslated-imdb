I do not know why critics broke this film. I hardly agree with them anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been more frightening - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to myself to see her in the daytime. I do not need to bother! ;) (The cinema was also full of children, heh!); ... Liam was as wonderful as ever. I also liked Catherine Zeta-Jones (Theo) and Lilly Taylor (Eleanor Neil) <br /> <br /> The house was very Gothic and very nice in a nervous way. The special effects and sound were fantastic. I also liked the degree of music, especially the gentle Lenore songs and her journey to save the children, how she grew up from her idle routine and her life and gained strength, peace and freedom in the end.
