Returning to the third room is a comedic sequel to the 36th epic chamber of Shaolin, where Gordon Liu played the role of Shan T, the young man who became a monk and a wonderful fighter. In this context, Liu plays a losing loser to learn Kung Fu after he has hit his friends. He mimics the original Shan Te, tries all kinds of tricks to reach the Shaolin Temple for learning and finally gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses. It is a story of classical martial art, with the values ​​of the Ace production of the Shu brothers and the direction of the certain foot of Lui Chia Liang. The design of dances is wonderful everywhere, be it fighting or humoristic comedy and Gordon Liu's performance, as others do, especially the friendly monk works perfectly on the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the other works of the stars, and there are certainly the films of Shaw Brothers greater, more violent and sweeping. But few of them have a magical blend of tape-rigging, unique training and fighting, with a subtle yet warm tale of a useless man doing good. Filled with light joy, it is impossible not to give this higher score.
