I watched this last night after I had not seen her for several years. It's really a fun little movie, with a bunch of faces you did not know. Arkin shines as always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it has just been released on DVD and unlike its packaging, it's widescreen. Transportation is fairly bad, but at least a WHOLE video. ;-)
