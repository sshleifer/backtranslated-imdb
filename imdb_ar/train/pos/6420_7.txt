This is a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding collaborated in a very powerful and powerful film industry. This is the true story of the first black submarine in the US Navy and the obstacles he faced in obtaining his testimony by an apartheid master. Along the way, he must also face a normal old fanaticism from all his classmates, and none of them wants him to be dismissed. They leave the barracks when they arrive. In the end, he earned a degree and continues his career as a diver in the US Navy. Watch this one! It is a wonderful story of courage and honor. When the story unfolds, we see racism slowly dissipating and everyone begins to respect men one by one.
