The great use of the technique of exaggerating the image shows the highest optimism in the current Christmas celebrations. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa Pedro summarizes the behavior of the society looking for the telescope) is unique (and Jean-Luc Godard, though precise, was clearly stolen in his film Pierrot le-fou). Highly recommended!
