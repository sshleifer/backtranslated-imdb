I really enjoyed this. I thought it would be a documentary, but it revealed itself as a good part of the tongue in the fun of the cheek. <br /> <br /> I think this has been well executed, largely a television show extended to a movie, but because of characters or rather original actors wanting to have fun and entertainment, this work helps in an old fashioned way Innocent. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the original TV series then I'm sure you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Q.
