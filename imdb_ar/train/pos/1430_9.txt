This was playing on our stage in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see had been sold, so we went into this, without knowing anything about it except that it was a documentary about the planet. We were very happy because of our misfortune because this was a very strong film about life and the delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the earth's population. This film contains some of the most watch photographs I've seen in a movie and taken me to places of deserts to the ocean to the rainforest and showing things I have never seen in a movie, television or book! "Earth" is a film that every student must see before he becomes reckless. I will encourage my niece to see this film because it will inherit the planet we leave. It is also a movie that can be viewed on a large theater or television screen because photography is very strong and strange.
