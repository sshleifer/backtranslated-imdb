The most striking highlight in this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. Turn comedy wild and terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than Autol? I do not think so. What a wonderful face this man has! <br /> <br /> The story is very strange and disturbing and emotional in parts (especially in the end) but also oddly influential and successful on several levels. However, I felt that the film was basically about the performance of Peter Otol and I was sure I would not enjoy it even if it was half.
