I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would say it was worth the effort. However, you must be aware that this movie will last for 210 minutes. If you do not have the ability to stay, place it on the tape and watch it for 2 nights. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you do not have a mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexander is a mixed pom, a giraffe and gigolo. He lives with an older woman called Mary. Mary owns a retail store and believes in Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had already vaccinated Gilbert, who lived with him. Gilbert threw him on a less attractive man whom she did not like because Alex abused and beat her. At this point, Alex was ready to get a job and help raise his child before discovering that Gilbert had aborted him and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By coincidence, Alexander meets a nurse called Veronica and they establish a relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the scary sex she had seen with men in the past. Mary and Veronika are struggling for Alex's affection and had a mnage à trois to boot. Finally, she revealed that Veronica was pregnant with Alex's child and asked Alex to marry him. We assume (as mentioned in the Gilberte case) that Alexandre will get a job and be supplied to his new family that is found. there is hope! <br /> <br /> "La Maman et la putain" concluded that Jean Eustache was concerned with the character of François Lebrune Veronica. She was a prostitute and then became a mother. Thus, the mother and the prostitute is the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (but not all) highly talkative, political without purpose, preaching, theatrical, unclear, and exam-taking. Lebrun and Léaud played their ambiguous characters well and grabbed the movie together because part of the script became lost and a little detached. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort. 10/07.
