How to lose friends and people are all honestly one of the best comedies I have seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. Not one of those "bold" comedy films that rely heavily on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at a reasonable pace and will be easily connected with the unexplored narration. Simone Beige taps him into the coffin with his funny portrait of an out-of-the-water character and soon breaks up with the trio he once belonged to in England (the other two will be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). It's hard to do at the top of the Hollywood food chain as we can clearly see with Pegg, and his first hit in the lead role was David Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run but he received lukewarm reviews from critics and fans alike. His second attempt was this film, and got pretty positive reviews from the majority but was flop at the box office. I, for someone, have not lost faith in him and will remain there when he wants to take that third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters have been well shot from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. It is amazing that Kirsten Dunst in my opinion was good in this film as a love angle for Pegg's character, but the spark that I saw in an interview with a vampire is still missing. They need to be found, quickly or suffer the consequences of loss in the land of "rom-coms" forever.
