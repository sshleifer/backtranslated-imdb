I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How did you come to see this wonderful film three years after it was released? He made me laugh, made me cry and ready my heart. Great moment. It's hard to describe my corrupt English - but I have to try anyway: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent all the time - from lead to supporting roles, fantastic acting, wonderful dialogue boxes and a completely edited movie. <br /> <br /> I think Farrelly Brothers' films are often underestimated - they are not a light comedy - they're deeeeeep! They talk about what life is about (I will not tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie confirmed what the relationships are all about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: let them go, let them be - try to share their passion and pain and be always honest with each other . <br /> <br /> I'm not averse to sports, but I'm definitely ignorant of sport. But in this movie - feelings get you. I could smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film has shown me what sports fans can mean and what wonderful families should be fans of. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot, Pete & Bob! <br /> Note: If you do not see it - please check KINGPIN!
