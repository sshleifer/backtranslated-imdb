Classic real, ten out of ten! Each representative is ideal, script is a painful series of suspicious scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this movie already exists on the DVD, because it should be displayed in a widescreen version. I saw this film in the late 1950s, maybe three or four times, and we have not forgotten it since. I remember that it was one of Warner's first films like cinemas, a process called Warren Scoop, which gave a very elegant film. Shelley Winters and Jack Banks have won the Oscars for their performances. The only thing I can criticize is not being directed by someone, like Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension.
