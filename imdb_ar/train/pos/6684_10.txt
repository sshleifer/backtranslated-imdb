This is a great movie. I love it more every time I watch. Most comedies can be lame because you know all the gags, but the mysterious men have a great deal of integrity in the writing and characterization they see again - as Ben Stiller cries over the bonnet in a limousine, or Hank Azaria talks to Louise Lasir, or Jeffrey Rush flashes his frenzied dances, or Tom Witts swaying while he watches the news report, or refuses Jeanine Jarvalo's kiss from Paul Rubens - it's fun. This is the perfect pitch representation band. The story evolves directly and consistently, and the sequences of work are creative and not very dominant, all set of rewards by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and been there for some time, watch it again and if you have not started then. You can not see it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Stodie, William H. Messi, Experiences Scene ... Lots of goodies!)
