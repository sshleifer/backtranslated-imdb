This is an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way they care about each other and help each other during their crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do, a number of bad choices, but they do not manage their backs on the family, they work to solve problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from middle child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family, it is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, grows up whether her father wants to happen or not. One thing they all share is that they are missing their mother. Danny (father) and Joey Uncle Jesse love these children a lot, and it is evident in every episode.
