I found this movie to be the usual French slap in the face of America. The camera often focuses on fat people, slow houses, and rusty rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize with fans in the small town and introduce them to the audience, the cinema exploits and degrades them. No doubt there were people who could be seen in Glinko and elegant orderly houses, but Malle chose to show us the worst that could be seen. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American directors go to France to reveal their worst elements to the American public. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that everything is not so good. Foreign migrants are not easily absorbed, leading to severe social inequality. But the Americans are not keen to reveal the French mask of its bias toward its citizens and their envy of the United States, so it is unlikely to watch films on the subject.
