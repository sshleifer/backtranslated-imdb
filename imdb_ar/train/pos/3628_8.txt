The film had many basic values ​​for family and love. She expressed human feelings and was an inspiring story. The text was clear (it was very easy to understand which made it perfect for children) and was fun and humorous at times. There were a few charged icons to search for. Cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of the experience of many filmmakers today (the silence that started to alert you a bit). He was clearly photographed but he had a nice soft quality for it. Although editing might be better, I thought it was a nice movie enjoyed by the family. You've been organized, something I did not like but it was a good movie.
