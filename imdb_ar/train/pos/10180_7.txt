Indian directors face great difficulties and have to compete with films such as "Lajan", where 11 male caravans defend their village and half are idiots. Devdas, a miserable foreign return, is oblivious to forgetfulness, with characters walking in endless corridors, oblivious to anyone's feelings or feelings - and unfortunately living in red-stylized ladders and a queen contest. But to make a good film, you have to walk with a tight rope to satisfy the front-runners who represent the stunning core papers with Split skirts and Dechom-Deschum's battles, preferably a prominent actor in Netwit's Bollywood, which is marginally handsome. So that she can communicate with a director who wants to tell the story of the head of the village of Leonin, who in his own words "defending his village" is a violent or very masculine film of a male audience. There are very few actors that can convey anger and compassion like Nana Battikar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you in his yard and watches him make fun of the politician when his loyal fans burst out laughing with every word he mocks while his daughter bathes his grandson. This is an authentic sight you can see in the countryside. India. Nana Battikar is the principal actor who belongs to the old school of work and whose dynasty is disappearing in Indian films. The violence portrayed is a complex part of storytelling with the dance and dance dances that have been offered to the actors without whom they will not sell films, which is sad but real. The faster this is changing the better for "Bollywood". All that was said and done is one good movie.
