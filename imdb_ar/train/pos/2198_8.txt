Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard, the third of its kind, is more dangerous than Hands Of The Table and The Princess Comes Across. It's another way to adapt to the Burlesque play that was apparently popular in the day. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque play on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season ran for 372 performances, the role played by Carol Lombard in that Barbara Stanwyck originated in Broadway that she brought to Hollywood. Nancy Carroll's version appeared in the early days of the talk, and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey there is still another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album released by Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler of Lux Radio. This is interesting work, believe me. <br /> <br /> However, both MacMurray and Lombard do well by the old chestnuts. The story is now in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz musician. Note the wonderful performance of Dorothy Lamor as a Latin alopecia that gets between Fred and Carol. Anthony Quinn in one of his first films as a wolf in the Lombard industry. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low has a nice real picture today and I will not be surprised if we see another comic version of the 21st century.
