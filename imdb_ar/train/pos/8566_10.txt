I really liked the 101 Dalmations when it was released in 1996 and now after 5 years I went to see the 102 dalmations in 2001, I thought it was great but I think 101 is better because I think it's funnier and more humorous and also this movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version One hundred and one (1961) I wonder if there are plans for the Dalmations 103. I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe not, all dalmation fans should discover that if there will be 103 dalmations in the future.
