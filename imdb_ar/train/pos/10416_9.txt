Like "Arabian Nights", this film plays with storytelling voices in order to make us feel that there is conspiracy, conspiracy and more conspiracy: it begins with what appears to be a frame device for a blind man telling his life story, then drowning the flashback that takes us directly to the present blind man, Where we discovered that about half the story had not yet come. (It must be recognized that the second half does not fulfill the first promise). Like Arab nights, he tries to squeeze as many of the popular Middle Eastern forms into his work as possible. A freemasonry, a beautiful princess, a volatile carpet, wonderful mechanical games, cruises, a busy market, a wicked minister, jewels ... I do not know why all this works, but it works. Everything is very nice. Beautiful collections. Jun Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's degree is particularly beautiful. As usual, it looks Hungarian. But somehow he managed to convince us that he was Hungarian in a Persian way.
