Despite all the respect and appreciation of this film by the Kung Fu historians, it still lacks clarity in two key areas: movement and scenes of fighting. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most authentic I have seen in the martial arts film. Five deadly poisons is undoubtedly a must, not only that, a movie you can watch over and over again; but I must say that after watching it feel like it could have been better. Let you somehow want something, you want more. Zhang Chih prepares the story beautifully for possible masterpieces, but does not follow by giving us more of the activity we want. The fighting styles in the film are illustrated (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad) and are shown, but the battles are remarkably short. The toad and snake styles are particularly interesting, and they were supposed to be much more, in fact, the toad was killed by the middle of the film. Interestingly with this film, the lack of a continuous movement or fight leads to the development of a big plot, and this is one of the few kung fu movies that you are really interested in and are interested in the story results. This movie has a dark and sinister tone, and you're attracted to it. Use evil weapons and torture methods throughout the film and add to the feeling of movies. To start the film and introduce a Poison Clan product, Chang Cheh moves us into a dark cell. The final fighting scenes are definitely good but they look somehow muffled you expect more. This is still one of the best Shaw Brothers movies and it's very fun. My general impression of the film will end with this: the patterns used by the fighters are shown to us only and are not shown in detail. The sad thing is that the director had something unusual in his reach and did not expand it. . I have left wondering what it would have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 of 10 on a scale.
