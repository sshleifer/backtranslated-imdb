Henry Thomas was "great". His personality held my attention. I was so "in" the story that I forgot it was not real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person was. The other people in the story were necessary in the composition of his character. The way they gathered together to help each other was really wonderful. I like movies that show the true side of human feeling without having to put you down, because you're not smart enough to explore things yourself.
