The first slanted film in Australia is moving strongly on screen. And a stab. And a slice. Shouting or two. A lot of blood, fear, red herring and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are lots of first pieces surrounding Cut - it's the first version of Dave Warner, although he has many other options either, or in negotiation; it's the first major film by the director and Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; he is also the first film producer Martin Fabini. For a group of men who dip their toes in this type for the first time, they certainly know their stuff. <br /> <br /> The story of a group of Australian film students who heard of a hot film, Bloody, is never finished because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who played the psychological killer in the film. <br /> <br /> Although their lecturer (who was an assistant director on the night Hilary died) warns them that when someone tries to start a Hot Blooded movie again someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) Hester (Sarah Kants) Go ahead and complete the movie. They collected a crew and managed to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbull (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, to the original location - to complete Hot Blooded ?? After 14 years of filming. <br /> <br /> Of course, since this is an obscure film, it entails a lot of bloodshed ?? Long ago with a lot of laughter, a few good concerns and Australian rocking soundtrack. Stories show that Australia can produce a good horror film in the markets, as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a carefully crafted feature, with excellent special effects and a distorted and deadly plot - Scarman - it's welcome as well as the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddie.
