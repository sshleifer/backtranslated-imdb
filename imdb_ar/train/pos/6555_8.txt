I have read more than 100 books by Nancy Drew, and if you are not bright enough to follow them, Nancy Drew was YOUNGER Nancy Drew, not an 18-year-old who does not go to school from books about. That was when she was sixteen. Of course, they were not as smart as those in the book given that they were in grade X only. Other than that, I thought the film was very nice. They were clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. They were clear, in character, and courteous. I loved the embarrassment that Nancy and Ned had around each other because obviously they were not old enough to be in a serious relationship as in books. PG was nice because I, unlike most people in my age, enjoy movies without sex, drugs or obscene words.
