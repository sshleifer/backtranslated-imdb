In New York, when Luke Wilson's shy and lonely project manager meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the subway, he invites her to dinner and dine with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, having sex and revealing her true identity, saying she is the powerful superstar G-Girl. After meeting his co-worker and friend Hannah Louis (Anna Fares), Jeannie became in need of jealousy, control and manipulation. Matt followed the advice of his famous friend von Haig (Ryan Wilson) and emptied her heart. Jenny's life turned into hell, while he had a love affair with Hannah. However, the legend of G-Girl and his former lover of Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Isard), suggests Matt to attract Jenny to strip them of superpowers. <br /> <br /> "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is ridiculous and funny. This romantic comedy adventure has many fun moments and is very entertaining. Locke Wilson is a wonderful role in the role of the idiot, Anna Faris is very exciting as usual, and Uma Thurman is a wonderful role in the role of superlative superheroes who remember Glen Claus in "Killer Killer" or Evelyn Driver in Play Misty For Me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
