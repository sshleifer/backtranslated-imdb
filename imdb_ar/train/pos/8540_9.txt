It's funny how you can change your life in a second ... to attend The Waterdance for the first time, it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life may seem frightening, and I noticed that other people are suffering from a similar attitude that may help you Continuation. <br /> <br /> The performance of Eric Stoltz, especially Helen Hunt (oh man !, Helen is the purest and the most beautiful woman in the earth ...) is wonderful, as Wesley Snipes surprises in one of your last serious roles. A simple and deep film at the same time does not leave us indifferent to the message being broadcast: Enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Truly a film unless you attend an hour! (Sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
