Prisons are often not brought in conversations about the best horror movies of the 1980s, and there is a good reason for that because it is not one of the best movies ... but since you're browsing the classic movies that show the decade, it's certainly one of the best known / small films. The film has some connection to the movies. For starters, it's an early directing effort for Rene Harlin; the great director behind a number of motion films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly, we have an early role for Lord of the Rings Vigo Mortensen. The film is not entirely original but the line drawing is interesting. We are focusing on a prison that was reopened several years later. This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being put in prison by the prison governor. Of course, the spirit of the dead man does not rest in peace; when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead escapes for revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is not exactly Shawshank Redemption, but it takes into account the building of its various characters and while the main point of the film is always horror, the prison drama behind it all form an interesting base. This function is also good because unlike the basic premise, there is no really "plot" in the film and we rely solely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror that appeared in the film is sometimes strange but never finished, which may in fact be why this film is rarely remembered, as it was released after a decade of excess. Homicide itself is fairly good and fantasy, however, provides some key points. As the film progresses, we begin to delve into the backstage story of a vengeful ghost, and although somewhat interesting, some of the things around it are illogical and the film moves down a bit. However, everything is summed up in an exciting climax and overall I have to say that prison is a movie worth pursuing.
