Cinderella was one of the first films I ever saw, and for me it does not stop forever. It is a beautiful looking film, with gorgeous animation. My favorite animated scene was the dress scene - I just love those mice. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Snow White's, but they are delighted to sing, and remind us of Tchaikovsky. Dream is a desire that is love? Is the forerunner. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella perfect and powerful, mice provided great comic relief. The sisters did not do a good job, as did the devil. But I loved the best father's wife, she was really evil, compared to a great figure named "Godfather of Fairy". It is true that the film takes a little longer with the strangeness of mice, but it was really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overpriced, do not you mean? It seldom runs on TV, but a really bad sequel to Cinemagic on a regular basis. If you want to modify a wonderful Cinderella, try the Ever Ever wonderful experience or the luxurious Slipper and the Rose, which is not good. But whatever you do, avoid the supplement, which you have mistaken for, because you will thank me. 10/09. Bethany Cox
