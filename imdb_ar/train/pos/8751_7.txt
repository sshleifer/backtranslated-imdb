Two adventurous teenagers, the best friends, make a trip to Thailand for one final experience before they break up and go to college. It seems like a fun time to tour a strange land, so they meet with a stranger who attracts them to a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their bags. Are being arrested by local police and find that justice in Asia is completely different from justice in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is the main story line of "Brokedown Palace" and it was a good story. The film does a good job of portraying the abusive and corrupt justice systems of Third World countries. In fact, the picture was fairly moderate, because prison conditions are often much worse than filming. It is a reminder that no matter how bad our belief is that our judicial system is a basic one compared to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many fabricated cases in the film. Which hampered the story. The whole escape attempt was a fake fake. To believe that friends would be able to smuggle money for bribes to a prison in a padded bra, not to be discovered by guards who systematically scrutinized everything brought from visitors, presumably guards or spectators were totally in vain. <br /> <br /> The story also failed to put an end to the annoying question of how to take drugs in the backpacks (Claire Danis). Have you actually agreed to transfer drugs? We have left to guess. It was interesting to keep guessing about girls' innocence throughout the film, but we ended the film without really knowing whether one or both girls were guilty. Except for this big imbalance, the end was excellent and the results were unexpected. <br /> <br /> Claire Denis and Kate Beckinsell were very solid. The Danes, who were over-sold and under-represented, actually arrived as an actor in this film. Although her portrayal was often immature (as her character was), she improved as the film progressed and conditions became even more severe. By contrast, Beckinsell was flying under the radar throughout her short career and lighting up like Judy's shoe, which suddenly found itself in prison. It was the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was wrong as a lawyer. His angry and outrageous style has always been a feature in films like "While I was asleep," but as a lawyer in a Third World country in a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The tourist view of Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> In general, an entertaining movie has become absurd in parts by introducing some ridiculous scenes. I gave it 7/10.
