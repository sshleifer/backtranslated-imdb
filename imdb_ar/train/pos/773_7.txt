I was expecting something different: more passion and drama ... again another failed attempt at originality. I am sorry to say that the film is located in old clich√©s "youth" that may be appreciated by 15-year-olds. Not very convincing and common lines, lacking any intelligence. The sound is still well and well adapted. I can not say that this film is completely floundering, because people watch it but it does not meet the expectations of the public and sank into mediocrity. So, in conclusion, production keeps you in front of the TV for about an hour and a half, which is important. So, I think it's worth watching if you do not get annoyed
