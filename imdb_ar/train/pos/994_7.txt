I have seen this movie once and have seen it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good in the film, I feel they could have used a "less funny" character like Alvin Sanders. Fox scenes for example in prison when Edgar Clintin faces (David Morse) is very funny. David Morse once again is a wonderful picture of a cop. His tough but mostly quiet features are perfect for his role. Morse meets again with Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up falling heavily on Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in every movie. I personally like this quality in a film, where the actors end up in the same position as a previous film, as did the two people in The Green Mile. Overall it was a very good movie.
