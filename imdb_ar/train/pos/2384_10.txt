It is a well-known fact that when Jane Roddenberry first showed Star Trek on NBC, the original episode, The Cage, was rejected for being "too brainy." When the series had another chance, Rodinberry thought it would be fun to set up the events of the rejected episode as a law, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which is characterized by the unique distinction of being a sequel to what was, at the time, still an unfair episode. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, where they visit the former commander of the institution, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenny), now horribly distorted and paralyzed by an accident. Pike joins his successor in the spacecraft, awaiting an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who used to work under Pike, actually hijacked the ship and identified the path of Talos IV, a planet outside the boundary (death penalty) since Pike and Spock's last visit 13 Years. Of course, being a logical creature, Spock delivers himself and arranges a military trial to justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say more about the plot, because the rest will play in Part 2. What is really impressive is how Roddenberry creates the relationship between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek world, by going out with a certain type of flashback More will be too much) which allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what it can be to Trek, if not NBC rejected the original project. In particular, it is interesting to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not get back in the Menagerie) playing Pike as the most dangerous leader of Kirk and the days of Nemoi the first Kaspuk, who has not yet fully substantiated his personality: this is the only time in the entire series that Vulcan smiles Everyone's favorite is automatic. <br /> <br /> In short, it is not just a wonderful "puzzle" episode, but also a treat for those who can not be bothered to track the Cage in its original form (available as part of the Season 3 box set).
