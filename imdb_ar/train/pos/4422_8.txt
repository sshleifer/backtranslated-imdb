Well, if you're one of Katana's movie nuts (just like me), you're sure to appreciate the flick of the metaphysical Katana movement swinging in the blood. <br /> <br /> Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu starring Daisuke (Kajimusha). This samurai war between the Hicki clan and the Genji clan touches the peak of the final confrontation on the Jojo Bridge. Countless people. <br /> <br /> The demons, magic swords and Shinto priests versus the Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions offered by Maestro Sugo Ishi will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese flick off a rainy summer night.
