I attended the Chesapeake camp. It was located at the top of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in Maryland. It was a summer camp of a similar kind with a cabin. Founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started in the young vehicle and later became a new and young consultant, then waterfront manager. If the camp continues, I would do anything within my authority to become the camp manager. Unfortunately, YMCA authorities decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of M. I visited the former camp a few years later on a boat and was scared to neglect the MD's condition and natural destruction by its mother nature. The 350-acre site served a lot with all the advantages of connecting with nature displays. There was a black man named Curtis Ford, and his family of residents and caregivers of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and teacher. I am his idol every object. He could not even swim was a waterman. If I asked him where the fish was biting, he would set the place, and I had a ball. There was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
