For many here, I can not but praise Cast and Crew, who developed Talespin and others who made it throughout my childhood. All of those who commented here enjoyed quality not only in animation but in story quality, fonts and characters. <br /> <br /> To categorize this artwork as "animation" can never achieve justice in talespin, in fact it is an insult to its classification as "Cartoon", Talespin is a cartoon and nothing less, obviously the greatest A genius work is being produced at Disney so far, when Disney "pulled" out of the air a bit they realized what they did and I'm sure their spirits have been tortured by regret ever since. <br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain it, from the first one who is duck to another who I think is Duck Darkwing, Disney is plagued by failure because of the correct political and quantum leap has been taken back since, they prefer quantity on quality now let alone the full room With Monkey's for the story, I could not ask my children to see the amazing "cartoons" they are now releasing, fearing that they will all become Simpson sometime in the future and that 50% of the blame will be on them to watch it. I have all the offers from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s on the Harddrive, so in one For days it was not possible because of the damage to my children "Cartoon Crap" for your day and taste another piece of my childhood and I hold them and I owe it all to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin is undoubtedly the best animation ever produced in the world because it's depth, charm, lightness, compassion, passion, lack of quality and really bad story lines that many of them have today. None of this content in the words "Ed, Edd, Eddie, or anything else you can think of?" The trash produced today can be likened to the 3-year-old Hyroglyph, which depicts Picasso. <br /> <br /> The next time you see the E episode of the Talespin. Take a look at the wood grain on any wooden object or building like Higher for Hire and hear the quality of the workmanship and effort in the animation, and even the backgrounds of the shot were made as if they would be used over and over again. The Buildings look real to Art Deco, Well, not all episodes were great in animation but the lower-grade scenes were covered with high-quality scenes. Everything was the same at the end of the episode, and you might never notice at all unless you were a center You have to take care of the details. <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about this is what I love. You want to call "intentional errors" or "intentional errors" in each episode and some have two, for example in deep sheepskin. Rebecca says, "You're something Palo "Palo replied" Who am I! " Innocent as a pupil "take a look at the eyes of Rebecca, I won" do not spoil the rest of the Baloopers but you just have to watch them next time. <br /> <br /> All comments are 100% authentic and 100% authentic, I have nothing else to add to the fact that others have not already said it here, Disney, wake up coffee tattoo, I've been sleeping for more than a decade, stopped producing garbage and returned Quality to animation and stopped producing "cartoons", we've seen evidence of what you can do and want it again as soon as possible.
