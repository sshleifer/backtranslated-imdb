Find Your Game Man Your Man Jean Harlow, a Brooklyn working-class girl with Clark Gable, faces all kinds of problems. The film begins as a film, but over time, the focus definitely shifts to her character. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Gable as he pulls out a game he is fooling the street with his partner, Garry Owen and yells the mark for the police. While chasing Babel Gabel in Harlow's apartment and being a charming colleague, she protected him. <br /> <br /> Long before her participation with him and unfortunately with his speculations. Jable, Harlow and Owen tried to pull Greer's game on Paul Hurst drunk, but then Gabel would not continue with her. Of course, when Horst realizes that he has been deceived, he is still sore and fighting and Gabel must be expelled. But then it ended up outside the Harlow apartment, and this blonde blond hair makes it easy to select. She is a partner in manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a movie and modified with life in prison. Her interaction with other prisoners gives her some very good scenes. I think some of the material has been used later in the classic Caged MGM. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets a title song, and is done as a torch-style song, very popular in those days. She speaks / sings in the manner of Sophie Tucker and in good health. <br /> <br /> Gable is a good actor as he develops a conscience, a role he often plays, especially in my favorite film, Gable, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> Harlow who shines in this movie. I think it's one of the best I've done at MGM, its fans should not miss it.
