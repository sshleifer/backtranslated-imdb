Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are perfectly perfect for the roles there. I love the relationship between characters. If you do not see this offer, I highly recommend it. Although this program compares to Star Trek much of the time, it actually can not be because it is completely different. I'm a fan of the Star Trek, but I definitely hold this show much higher than any of the star flights. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and did not get Stargate on our TV, so if I wanted to buy, I have to buy DVDs, and season 10 has not come out yet, so I can not watch it for some time (which is very critical). But this program is very good and must be seen, but he is warned that he is very addicted. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda tapping).
