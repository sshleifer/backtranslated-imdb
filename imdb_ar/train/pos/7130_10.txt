Well, when I saw this movie before that, I was not sure if my tea cup was ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, a real family classic game. The story of a young man who was evacuated and his new father, Foster. This film beats all the boxes. I have not read the book (maybe this is a good thing and I mean I enjoyed the movie more) but as far as the story is concerned, I can not really think of any bad points and therefore scored 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything requires the highest marks! ). By the time William announced "I can ride my own, Dad!" I would delight my heart (anyone who sees it will understand, I'm sure). Really intimate, definitely recommended.
