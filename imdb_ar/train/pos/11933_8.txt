I think this is a pretty family movie. There are lots of funny scenes and warm moments you can spend throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects are well implemented throughout. Danny Glover plays the role of George Knox who runs the terrible baseball team "Angels" which is wonderful throughout the film. Young actors Joseph Gordon Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd are as wonderful as the Angel family and their influences are impressive in Disney's first film. A touching and heart-warming film that everyone should enjoy.
