This movie is very cheap, it's loved !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn), who offers the most exciting screen titles in the history of the film. I have two copies of this film in a video ... On one of them, Ralph Machio is discovered and is actually rising in the background at Major Vaughn while yelling at "HASH". It is clear that they forgot to modify this error outside the film, but it shows how funny the film, when the actors themselves can not maintain a straight face !!!
