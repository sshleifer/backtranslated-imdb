This little-watched film is a small and comfortable Jialo. Deviates from some cliches of the genre and adopts a more flexible approach. She is about a woman looking for her missing boyfriend; a psychologist suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason. Her search leads to a villa inhabited by a group of eccentric individuals. In real giallo mode, killing is never away. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o 'Nails Tails) and Sybil Danning (80's scream queen). Principal actress Rosemary Dexter, and although I'm not familiar with them, they do a good job of leading the picture. <br /> <br /> A distinctive feature of Eye in the Labyrinth is music. In the style of Gaillo, featuring jazz music. This result, written by Roberto Nicolosi, reminds us of Miles Davis, especially his work in In A Silent Way. It's excellent soundtrack and really gives this film a different feeling from most gialli movies. The melting gully accentuates the weak atmosphere and complements the sunny, sea-facing landscape in which most of the film is formed. <br /> <br /> This is Jialo so we really need to talk about killing groups. Well, this film is a little short in this regard. They are certainly not free of these but few and far between. The opening between the opening dream may be the best in the show as well as a series of memorable burning cars. But this is not really a particularly violent film. However, I do not think it should disappoint a lot of seasoned fans of this kind. The mystery is somewhat convincing and has enough eccentric characters (Saro's stupid boy and an unusual dialect to worry about?) And strange moments to please; while the corruption factor is clung to the nudity all the time. <br /> <br /> Play Eye in the Labyrinth is like the giallo version of Agatha Christie's puzzle, which includes a group of non-sympathetic characters in the villa, all on suspicion of murder; we have memories of mandatory memories that separate their links with the last hours of the murder victim Not very sympathetic). Although this is not an example of classification, it is certainly a different catchy type, because it does not borrow heavily from other films of this subtype. For giallo fans, I give this a thumbs up and one day wish to get a good DVD transfer. Definitely worth the treatment.
