9/10 - 30 minutes of horror on a net holiday. Well, this is not scary. But it is certainly fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper tells the story of fear of leaves, giving us all a Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That is. Bwahahahahha. You must be really careful about what AX Santa is doing. Do you have a scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Well, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Well, so in the story, a greedy wife (the best screech in the world, Mary Elaine Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who is whipped to death) in ANOES 2) for the money. However, her plan was destroyed when a crazy killer wearing a Santa's suit (Dr. Giggles "Drake) came on her way. <br /> <br /> If you look at YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (3rd offer). But if you do not see it, I suggest you do it.
