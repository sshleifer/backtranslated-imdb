Every now and then, the filmmaker brings to life a unique group of people and allows you to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Cassden did this again. I've always felt that theBg Cill was the anthem of his time and was able to do it again at Grand Canyon. Often we find ourselves at a stage where we have the opportunity to choose life and often we pay it. This film about people find the courage to choose and experience life because of this choice. The combination of small and large events that allow us to see how trivial most of the things that concern us are truly genius. I have watched this movie several times and am amazed at the depth of the emotions this film is going through. Danny Glover and Kevin Klein play their roles with great affection and portray Steven Martins as an invaluable exec. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
