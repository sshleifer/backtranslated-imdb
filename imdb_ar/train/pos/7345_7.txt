I picked up the movie at the flea market for $ 4 and definitely did not get my money! I could care more about the kids hot but the animation blew me away after a steady diet from the Simpson family (sorry Mr. Groning). Best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple sights with some great tunes, intimate friends and two cold tunes!
