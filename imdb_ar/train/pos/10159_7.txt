There are a few films or movies that I consider my favorites over the years. The Gospel was one of them. I saw it when I was young and wanted to see it again. My favorite part was that Jesus was blond, and the last supper was a great meal. <br /> <br /> 3 / I love playing with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and forever. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film was not sound from a theological point of view or of high quality, my heart was touched at the time. Besides I admire Johnny Cash and it was a brave adventure. If it appears on a DVD, I will buy it for purely emotional reasons.
