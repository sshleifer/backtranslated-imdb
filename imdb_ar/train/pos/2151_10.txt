Funny. Sad. Wizard. These are all the words that were raised in my head while I was watching this beautiful and simple film. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a film to really move me, but "Do we dance?" Done with grace to spare. This gentle humor mixed with hidden torment has sometimes been one of the best experiences of film-watching history. You left me with a sense of calmness with delight, but with a small touch of mixed sadness. <br /> <br /> Dance, oh yeah, dance. Even if you are not a fan of art, or can not put one foot in front of the other, the steps shown here will take your breath and make you want to register in the classroom as soon as possible. It was quite enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama (which Kogi Yakusho depicted impressively) hit the steps when he was learning to dance at first was beautiful in a comical, childlike way. However, this film was not entirely about dancing, but was about more details about human behavior and feelings. We see a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance teacher who rediscovers her love for art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful support team. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Feelings. All the love and little pain of life is expressed with the exact feeling of a wonderful Japanese waterboard with the emotional power and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
