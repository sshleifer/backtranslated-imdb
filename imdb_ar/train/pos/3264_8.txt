What is the loss of the death of director Emil Ardolino! He could take a light text, and with a proper voice and editing, he would flash it and make it shine like a star. This special star may not be the smartest in the sky as it is with great romances, but it is certainly the one that keeps you waiting until the end. You really want to know how things will go. <br /> <br /> The script is ideal for Cipler Shepard, who was in time to take advantage of her success in "lighting the moon" for the new generation that was (fortunately for her) perhaps unaware of the number of big men on the big screen after A very promising start. In this film, everything returns in her form as a widow still eager to live through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson on the stardom threshold that will culminate with "fried green tomatoes" two years later). It may sound too small for this role, but it works well in the way the story unfolds. This is her film, but it does not exceed her limits as a leader. <br /> <br /> Shepard allows Robert Downey Jr. to take on a large part of the film and shows a more mature melody than in his earlier films. There is considerable support from Ryan O'Neill (in his best role for years) and Christopher McDonald. Mysterious charm naturally charms the coasts largely on its own, either to have or have a way of making its character look like a refreshing breath with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino takes advantage of sex actors in the same way he did with Dirty Dancing, but this is not surprising, so you can still see it with your parents if they happen to be in the room. (Use your best, understand your parents after all.) I give this movie a high mark because it's very easy to use, and romantic comedy lovers will find it awesome, and those who watch with them will only find a lot of humor to enjoy too. <br /> <br /> Once again, thanks to Emile Ardolino for making the most of the Randy and Perry Hawes scenario. (Where are they now?) The next Ardolino will be a phone call for "Three Men and a Child", but his last act of "Sister Act" will finally give him an overwhelming nine-figure hit. Mr. Ardolino, a cinematic touch missed!
