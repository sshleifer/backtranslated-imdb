Maxx is a deep psychological introspection camouflaged as a strange supernatural story. Julie Winters is an "independent social worker" in a dirty, unnamed city, blended with crime, and all the people she knows have a lot of issues to solve. Maxx is her friend and client, or a streetwalker who is thought to be a superhero in fashion - or is it the opposite? <br /> <br /> Maxx is not to be missed for the same artwork or story or great vocal work - especially the late soundtrack of Barry Stegler, and the wicked expression of the main villain, Mr. Gunn. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this, do not miss the opportunity.
