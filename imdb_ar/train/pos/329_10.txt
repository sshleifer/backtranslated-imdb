Of all the versions of Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story of this matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true in the original story - with some minor aberrations and omissions, for example the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus disguised in his hut - a realistic scene of representation and original fashion all contribute to making this a truly memorable masterpiece, not some Swords and Sandals B-flick Although the dialogue and subheadings are entirely in Italian, if someone is familiar with the story, they can still make headers and tails of what is going on and what the actors say (provided you have good handy text for the handpiece). I did, at least, and it prompted me to study Italian to appreciate the film better.
