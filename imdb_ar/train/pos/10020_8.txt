The legendary Boris Karloff finished his illustrious career by making four claws in Mexico. This is a period of Gothic mood horror entering the horror of a bunch. Karlov offers an interesting performance and a creme like Matthias Mortifal, the old eccentric patriarch who invites many of his frail, greedy and poor relatives to his reckless castle to read a will. Soon, the disgusting guests will be shocked by real-life people who fill the place. Andres Garcia, the Mexican sex symbol at some point in the movie "Tinturaira," the hero of the lost policeman hero, looks very charming as the only female character. In the words, the thick trend, the digitized text, the filthy dirty filming, and the murderous murder of the irony (a fat fat smash explodes directly in the face with a small cannon!) The largely depressed, largely owned, melancholy atmosphere (Karloff is especially excluded) ), A mild gourd gourd, poor dubbing and firework all add to this horrible lemon a kind of amazing luster, and thus the strangest charm of the rat. Shouted a real Camby.
