This film is a horrible, non-stop riot that includes all the usual components of the comedy Dawood Dawan - struggling heroes, supporting characters, puppets for the bad guys, churches, and comics. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda play double roles of policemen and men. Amitabh's heroine is Ramia Krishnan and Ravina versus Govinda the policeman. The heroines are just stifled pillars as usual. Conmen does not have the heroines. Barish Rawal carries his malicious actions in the David striker (played a role Don in the Khibor also). Asrani shines in a brief role. He is remaking his famous film "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is as flawless as usual - as a respectable good humorist Pyaare Mohan and as a fraudster Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the style of Indian Bihari speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, dwindles compared to him. But AB is still fine. Madhuri Dixit plays a veil in the song "Makhanna". It dances like wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is great. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for any LOGIC because it is a comedy and enjoy a completely comfortable screenplay. Just enjoy yourself.
