Cliffhanger is a decent criminal adventure with some drawbacks from director Renny Harlin who admires making this film about an expert climber who finds himself being held hostage with a friend by a gang of dangerous criminals searching for suitcases full of cash stolen in rocky mountains. Sylvester Stallone Impressive as an expert climber Jackie Walker is special in the sequence of motion / fighting but some of them are definitely on the unreal line. For the film though I am willing to suspend my non-ratification. Other actors including John Lithgow, Michael Rocker, Janine Turner, Rex Lane, Caroline Goodall, and Leon, are supporting characters in the film. The sequence of motion / fighting is performed well but as mentioned by some it is not very realistic no matter how strong you are. However, the climbing sequence is very well done because instead of doing the whole movie in the studio somewhere, the sites they choose look very real and Ariel's views of the mountain ranges are wonderful and add a touch of reality to the film. The deaths are innovative and others are predictable. The bad guys are solid, but it would be better if they focused on one more central rather than focusing on many of them. The speed of the film was a bit slow but the good was worse than the film. If you are a fan of Harlins or Stallone more opportunities, you'll enjoy it too. In general, Cliffhanger has a personal twist with enough movement, drama, some thrill, excitement, excitement and good performances by the crew that makes this movie worth the time to watch.
