Give this movie 10/10 because it is worth 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matau and George Burns - collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in the film - director Herbert Ross - all of which makes the modification of the stage a reality. Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the seventies. I like the kind of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh hard. <br /> <br /> I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was only $ 3 cheaper). I watched him as soon as I got home, but I had to see him again because I kept missing a few parts for the first time. The second time I saw, I felt much better, and laughed a lot. I will definitely re-get this on DVD because I see special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how it happens. Two people work together as artists / actors / performers. They are on stage, but they really argue on stage, they can not survive with each other, and then 15 years later, they want to reunite for a private television show. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns was fantastic in this film. It is a shame of shame they died. George Burns deserves that Oscar. Gave a strong comic performance. It was also 78 when the film was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academic award in old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also wonderful at this. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. I deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people may disagree with what I'm saying, everyone has made a strong performance in this film. This is an instant classic comedy. I strongly recommend it. Another thing: all who hates this movie is "Boots"
