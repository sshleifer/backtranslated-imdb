This is one of the best movies out there that says a lot that it was for TV. I really wish to have it at d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt performed such a harsh performance. The rookie cop thrown into the serial killer case is played completely. When it collapses because it kills another child, it was wonderful. She is alone, so she gets it. When you talk about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber where the serial killer was so awful! He really brought her into his dark world. Oscar was worth it. When talking about killing children, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really do not make them anymore. It was a real film without being Guria.
