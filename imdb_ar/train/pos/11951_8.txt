Something happens to Sondra Branski when the magician's box enters the stage in London. Sondra does not know the spirit of the newly left journalist Joe Strombel to ask her to check out the man someone told him, on his journey to another dimension, the murderer of Tarot the villain who committed a crime in London. The only problem is that the accused man, despite all appearances, is a respectable man of the upper class. <br /> <br /> When Sandra tells her experience to Great Splendine, also known as Mr. Waterman, the magician is stunned, but decides to live. The two will attend an invitation to a club where Peter Lehman goes swimming. Sundra, which falsifies it sinking, attracts the attention of this great piece, which you want to see more of them. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the two will catch up in all ridiculous situations until the mystery. Revealed at the end of the film. The real killer in Tarot does not think he can fool a firm Sundra who proves to be more tricky than he has given her credit. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with lots of laugh which is just what one needs out of the heat to a perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has performed well, yet this sunny comedy will prove his past failures. In the movie "Scoop", Mr. Allen took himself from the romantic leadership of his brilliant wife. His brand gesture is something that this funny man will not get rid of, as he seems to be his trademark. The movie contains some funny lines that will appear on top of viewers who may not care. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of Scoop, seems to be Woody Allen's perfect chip. She plays the straight part while Mr. Allen does his unique work, a perfect combination. Both are excellent at joking throughout the film. Miss Johansson is pretty a knockout in her own red swimming suit, although she wore her mashed clothes in most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lehmann, a decent man from the city with the right proportions. He appears well in the film as a man chasing Ms. Johansson. Ian MacShane plays the role of dead journalist Fleet Street on his way forever. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film for a hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
