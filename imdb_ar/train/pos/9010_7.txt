The taste is a little strange and limited; but clever enough to be worth watching. Jane Schatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) joined a young woman with wheelchairs, along with Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of a human journey. He makes a plane in his vehicle and plans to fly it. He wants to revive his turbulent life by taking care of the independent Jane, who is dying, and suffering from a neurological disease that left everything but her speechless motor skills. A wheelchair full of soul, and her hope of death is to lose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who will not help her directly; but he is willing to steal a bank in order to pay gigolo to do the deed. I found this ambitious flick and humor. Even in this role, Carter has an attractive personality and admiration.
