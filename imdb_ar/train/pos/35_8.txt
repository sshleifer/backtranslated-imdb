When I saw a detachable DVD box for this horrible Red Queen statue, I felt sure I was in a big disappointment, but a surprise, a surprise, I loved it. Nonsense of course It is unforgivable that such complex complexity should be so rampant that it is barely able to read the translation, not to mention the funny interpretation. These quirks, however, the film is a dream. Beautiful women in wonderful clothes in a wonderful atmosphere and everything is always in motion accompanied by Bruno Nikolai wonderful record. Moriconi may not be but in these light pieces may be. Really fun with lots of colors, lots of sexual activity, some murder kills and minimal police interference. Excellent.
