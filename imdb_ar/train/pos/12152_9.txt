I watched this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a really tragic love story! I appreciate the fact that the man in the heart of the story has lost use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving a physically disabled person. The love that grew up between that character and the woman who enters his life depicts well how love to think about love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... All 27 when I made this film ... It was wonderful because the woman is full of life and she is able to revive this man's heart. Unfortunately, because his family is wealthy and does not have, the "problems" are evolving. <br /> <br /> She plays on HBO several times this month.
