For those who commented on The Patriot as being meticulous (and who basically mastered English), it was fun to watch this movie. By all accounts, this was the bloodiest war the Americans ever had, and they were the only nationality. So it was very refreshing to see something like the historical accuracy coming from this part of the Atlantic Ocean and did not paint America as martyrs or saviors. In general, what the film brought home was the real horror of any conflict, and how all the acts committed in war only led to worse deeds, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. It was not a movie that anyone encouraged, but he was sorry for and hated everyone.
