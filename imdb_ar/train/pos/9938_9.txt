We bought a DVD set from "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... life" (English) for our bilingual children because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German). The series "Man" (English) (the parents have seen us as children) has surpassed the high expectations! The series is very well done, does not show its age, and our children of all ages love to see it at the same time. The series covers everything related to the human body of organs, all senses, blood, infection, antibodies, and much more in moving rings From 20 to 25. Subjects that some people may find "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in a delicious, confidential and child-friendly way (the reproductive cycle begins most often as the child begins to grow), while still (as usual) rich in information and fun. /> <br /> Children are often intrigued by how their bodies work, and through the rings, they gain an understanding of it in the context of their environment, the coordination of rings between the outside world (a family with two children) and the inside of the body moves, for example, The wound is accidentally injured and the loop covers how the body interacts with this. Similarly, the rings on the senses, for example hearing, seeing, linking what happens inside the body to the outer world context and a loop on breathing and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers a whole life cycle including (briefly) where oxygen comes (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs ever - I would say it is essential for every family with children!
