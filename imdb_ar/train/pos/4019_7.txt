Since I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, he made me more careful to check this out. I remember that he was interviewed on Jay Leno, and he refused to play in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in this film. It is clear that Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he was acting absolutely. Snoop will not overstate his performance in the "Tenants". There's definitely a rapper / best actor, like Moss Dave, who could have done more through his role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good" job. He can not seem to get rid of some of the body's trademark movements and his vocal anomalies, but this is something Jack Nicholson even has trouble doing. The key point is that I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and the character of Dylan McDermott captures. By the way, McDermott offers the best performance in the film, although Snoop is likely to be blocked by his hidden representation. Being a great reader and ambitious writer myself, I could only find the characters and paint a little bit. This has exacerbated how I will ask Snoop's character to constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and rebuke him for his criticism. But did you know? I'm sure a lot of writers like that. His character was supposed to be flawed, as McDermott was in his own way. My only moderate criticism of the film will be its end. For some reason, I felt a strong rush for me, although the decision was certainly logical and motivated by characters, rather than conspiracy.
