Well, it's not a perfect film in any way, but I do not agree with IMDb public opinion that it's really bad. I saw a lot of Hong Kong granules in the 1990s and loved an expensive era. I did not see a "black mask" at the time and I only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the embarrassing poor dubbing that did not give me a DVD copy with the option to stop, the film contains the primary energy and adventure that dominated Hong Kong films during this time. I still stick to my style when it comes to work, these guys, regardless of their budget, add an element of magic to the screen, no Bourne or Royal Casino or the mission is impossible (I do not touch these films - Spontaneously this one and I feel very organized) will ever check. What is that? It's a feeling that filmmakers were experimenting with while filming and editing, and were not afraid to leave in some impurities to learn lessons next time. For me, this makes watching movies more fun and dangerous.
