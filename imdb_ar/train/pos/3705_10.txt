I do not understand the low 5.7 rating in this film. It is a pleasure for people who like a strong hanging plot and a dark atmosphere. The tone reminds us of a midnight night in the Garden of Good and Evil, down to the local settings (Savannah). The representation is strong, and I was amazed by the southern dialect of Southern Kenneth Kenneth. Famke Jansen is wonderful, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. Naked scenery is full of her, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but implemented effectively.
