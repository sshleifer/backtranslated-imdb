I've seen it several times and plan to buy the full feature. I love every comedy Jason Steele. It's very different, unique and very fun. I love indie films and this one is awesome. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film revolves around a modern spoon called Edward. The arrangement of events is a bit mixed, making this movie very enjoyable to watch. At first you see Edward fighting spoons, but the focus changes to pre-life. It's a silly movie, but of course it's still wonderful. I highly recommend watching this movie on www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. he is very funny. Humor may not match everyone's taste but watch anyway. It will take only 16 minutes of your time, which is free. GO Watch Madness Spoon!
