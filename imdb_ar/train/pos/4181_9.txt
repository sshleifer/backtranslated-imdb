It has been a long time since I saw this film (at least 15 years) yet I still have a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <br /> A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts is being captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mine-laying mission at a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> These men in prison expect the same treatment as any other prisoners of war, but what scared them soon is to learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies because they were wearing military uniforms when they were captured. The consequences of such a violation, under the Japanese Self-Defense Act, are the execution of beheadings. <br /> <br /> Despite their pleas, and the sympathetic sentencing of the prison guard, the day of reckoning is approaching like a ticking time bomb. The tension is too high, you will actually hear the tick sound, although it may be just your chest beating with the rhythm of a march execution squad. <br /> <br /> The end is so painful that it can not be revived in my head to a lesser degree. Write it here. But I can promise you - you'll never forget him. Good luck in finding video in the United States
