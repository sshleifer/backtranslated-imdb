This film begins with joy from about 15 seconds, and continues throughout the film. I can not remember a scene in which I did not turn to looking at people laughing at me. He is the ideal representative of this list because of the way he looks and the way he is dressed. <br /> <br /> The comedies were wonderful to see from the actors are not great or very popular. As you can see people who like this movie, it is currently rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be at 250. To put it this way I have not seen this funny movie since the American Pie Movie or the original holiday. See it if you want to laugh. I give this 2 film from the top of my thumb that I made since I discovered IMDb, the wonderful movie site.
