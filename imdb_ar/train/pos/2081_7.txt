I saw the first 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Sydney Sydney Monastery): a good record for farmers in China and their rise to the forefront and conflict with what Mother Nature has given them. The film is based on an award-winning novel that chronicles a family that begins with the marriage of the master son of a slave girl. The film does a good job of keeping your interest in spite of the somewhat strong performance of Paul Muni. The film tells Wong Long (Mony's character) how he buys land, buys more land, and eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land where the original originated. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Louis Reiner, is the main thread of the story (along with the land itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, it does a very good job in presenting the country and people. MGM obviously used funds to create a really good epic with this period in an era they could probably bear. The scene with Locusts is done very well and the rest of the film looks really good and deserves the Best Film Award at the Oscars that year. The final definition of the epic is what this story has pulled out well.
