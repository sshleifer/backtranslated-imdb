I've seen this movie more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the scheme afterwards. But then - this is part of the Petzold game: it plays with genre rules. <br /> <br /> It is very nice, and how the story that is so intolerable about how to meet the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) is again reflected in another story, even more likely, that girls make up for casting. This film is a journey between reality and fiction, it relates to possibilities, things that may have occurred in the past or may occur in the future, more than mere actual events. It is a fantasy, so - so appropriate that there are many motives, Freud may have found an interest in the analysis of his dreams, such as all the forms "doppelganger." <br /> <br /> Also, I think that "Gespenster" might be interesting to see compared to the current Asian cinema of Strange: Petzold's daily architecture also feels strangely inhabited and strangely unfamiliar. This film is not about what is obvious. Calling it the story of two girls meeting and eventually becoming friends and lovers, or a story or an orphan, looking in Europe for her lost daughter, she clearly does not remember much about the "Gespenster" nature at all.
