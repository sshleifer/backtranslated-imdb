There is a certain attraction I have always found in the discovery of the big (unknown) film. These discoveries have always been almost dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, motion and horror are unknown for very good reasons. You've found "High Tide" on your video in an unwanted store, mixing countless scores of different quality tapes. Of course, this is the only place I find it, because it still does not exist on the DVD. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Judy Davis (like Lilly) throughout this movie, I was sure I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I have already seen Davis in several small parts - and the role of a single tournament in "Passage to India". But, although it was brilliant in the above film, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently watched Gillian Armstrong's latest film, "Charlotte Gray", I was quite aware of the kind of actress she liked. Davis draws more than a passing resemblance to Kate Blanchett - in terms of form and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis's performance is amazing, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an amazing relationship on the screen with Claudia Caravan (as an ally), another great actress in this film. There is a lot of quiet drama and humanity that they share together, and I will not assume their details here (see for yourself!). There are plenty of goodies in the "high tide" that must be covered in one review. In fact, I do not care - the film speaks well about itself. In conclusion, I would like to commend the scriptwriter Laura Jones for her amazing dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors, and the great Roselle Boyd for his wonderful and wonderful cinematic portrayal (see his work on Tender Mercies).
