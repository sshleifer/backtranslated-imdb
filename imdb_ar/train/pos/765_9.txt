I think when "Beat Street" appeared nationally, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem of "Flashdance" is that there was only one dance scene for rest and the rest was jazz and ballet. That was one of the reasons why Beat Street was the best. The only film that can compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both films focus on how people use dance to express their feelings. <br /> <br /> Dance scene scenes at "Beat the Street" come before the middle and end of the flick. I love them all. Almost all of the restroom tricks were shown in jam scenes: breaker, torches, head spins, suicide sit-ins, crazy legs, humans, the other face, figure four --- almost everything. <br /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has gang-related violence in the hip-hop world ... but in a less violent way than before. The only major fighting scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who was shortened in the film as "Ramo") was chased by a member of a rival gang on New York City's subway tracks. The third rail are both electrically dead on those railways. Well, although this chase scene ended tragically, it was better to die this way instead of exploding the blood than a shot of a gang. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang elements in the click were hip hop, culture and rap. A lot of rap music has appeared in the click, because hip hop members have used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the distinctive song of the film, which closed the curtain to the click, was not only a tribute to hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> Incidentally during the dance scene Tango, Tango, I think that the drummer in the pit orchestra performed by actress Ray Don Cheung was Sheila E.
