Interesting old horror movies, a lot of yelling, lots of shouts, and lots of humor to keep up with it. "The Blob" is a classic game in its work. Steve McQueen (1930-1980) plays the role of a teenager trying to be a hero in his town. Going out on dates with his daughters is fairly normal for all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same falling objects as the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him get the best he can. When it comes to teen power, this movie really provides. I know that most teenagers have had difficulties when they act, and when the danger happens, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When adults in the city end up learning the hard way about running "The Blob", they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get better. The sleeping juggler was fairly pleasant a day and in my opinion I thought it was JELL-O! When everyone starts to stop this danger, the city becomes safe again, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Gilo and watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Gilo, the hardest! Rating 5 stars
