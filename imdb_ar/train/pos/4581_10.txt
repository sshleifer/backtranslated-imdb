A French novelist, disgusted by the friends of his wife's community, goes to North Africa for a break. There he faces a gay and talented Bedouin girl living in poverty. To enrich his wife, who loves Maharaja, decided to train the girl and teach her to the Parisian community in the name of PRINCESSE TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The brilliant role of Josephine Becker in this French film was very enjoyable. With her enormous eyes and infectious smile, she communicates with the viewer's hearts instantly. Her great personality and sheer joy in performance make it a pleasure to see her. Becker makes us care about what happens to the poor woman during her transformation and is introduced to European customs. <br /> <br /> Albert Brygian works very well like Pygmalion to Baker Galatia; George Bitlett is also effective as a half-secret servant, and Jan Jaland as a mysterious Maharaja. <br /> <br /> The film is very handsome and well-made, and appears a little in the Busby Berkeley movies produced simultaneously at the same time in America - despite American films in this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM did not have any racism. It should be noted that there was no Hays office or production code in France. Some of the dialogue and movement are somewhat exciting, but it must be acknowledged that Baker sings and dances to "Under the African Sky", as well as her performance culminated in a Parisian nightclub, two of the most memorable moments in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The actual location of the scene in Tunisia greatly enhances the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, in a very poor family. However, her talent and ambition in leadership soon led her to move to the East and was briefly a wonderful member of Ziegfeld Follies. She realized that America in the mid 1920s imposed great restrictions on a black-talented woman, who managed to reach Paris, eventually joining Foli√©s-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French love her and become an adult celebrity. A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked in the resistance during the early days of the war. Becker moved to Morocco for a while enjoying the Allied forces stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Becker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial and personal difficulties. For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to stay in the Principality. Josephine Becker was about to return when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> After appearing in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich and Robson as one of the real legendary artists of her generation.
