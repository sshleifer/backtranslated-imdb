I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and really loved Dana Plato, who later starred in different hits like the Kimberley Drum. I do not think it's garbage. It was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary. It's just a cute kids movie about 3 kids chasing men who are trying to find the creek beast. Men are hurt and saved by the help of the creature. Hunting footage of the Arkansas marshes and landscapes were clean. It is a good film for children, there is no real violence for a little fear but good fun for young children.
