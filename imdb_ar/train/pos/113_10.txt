I have not seen this film since about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite films, this is what I seem to always remember first. There are some films (such as "Dark City" and "Breaking the Wind") that seem to touch a place inside you, a very protected and hidden place, but very sensitive, leaving a lifelong impression on the viewer, no different from an event Changing life, such as ending a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "shocked me" when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional headache that lasted for several days.
