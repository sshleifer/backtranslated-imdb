Ettore Scola, one of the most famous and biggest filmmakers of our worldly compatriots, is not yet available on DVD ... (It's the summer of 2001 right now ....) Secrets that interest the mind. <br /> <br /> These grand classics returned to the theaters in my town thanks to Sophia Loren - back to the summer retrospectively, and to see them again on the big screen after all these years watching them on video - the tape ... it's a real gift . <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism, however, try to prove a point: my younger brother took me to see this film. He has never seen the film before and "does not like these old Italians ..." Like all the others in the theater, he was fascinated by this wonder. Even at the end of titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This special day is really special. A wonder of refinement. A great loss if you do not see it (yet) ...
