This movie is so wonderful her marriage is likely to be the characters of the 1940s and Meg Ryan is struggling to be known as "smart". In addition to Tim Robbins is very nice in this film. Everything around him has a magical feeling towards him. Every time I see her I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, I'm a girl, so I admire it. I also love music. The violin is wonderful. But besides that I think it's a nice story and everyone should see it.
