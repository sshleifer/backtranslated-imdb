I first saw this film in 1990, and died at all laughing through it. I became a favorite of my group of friends, and we quoted it at a hat point ("I'll go home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor still exists, 15 years later. I found Halloween candy to be much better with your tongue planted tightly in your cheek. This movie provides all the emotions, suspense and love. No return and nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano offers amazing performance, such as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in the "faces of Dr. Lao Seven" as a bad person faced a bad ending. Here, you really feel the old man from the start. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will lose some levels of humor in this movie. Creators have come to true accuracy in many ways through vulgar comments, fine-grained artworks in other science fiction movies, and even a scene copied from Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Do not spend too many thought processes trying to analyze a film, people - this is a fun fare without having to pick, it should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know they are being exposed) Ridiculous ..) . <br /> <br /> - Now if you excuse me, I'll go for a "Zag-nut" bar .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, DJ / Karaoke DJ
