As a popular sport, surfing was a favorite for many people. After watching the documentary directly, I realized how dangerous it was. In fact, surfers are also afraid of big waves. So someone killed. But they continued to ride the waves and enjoyed themselves. Only brave people can do this. <br /> <br /> According to surfers, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave came on them. You have to adapt to your best and avoid a direct hit from the big wave. When you win, this will clearly bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Amazing cinematic photography can not be overlooked. This enjoyment is very visual. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 10/08
