I went to this movie do not know anything about it, and I really ended up. It lacked authenticity and credibility - some of the things the characters said and done were quite strange, and it seems that much of the text was written (maybe this is a model for Woody Allen?) But the entire audience in the theater was laughing hard. It was not even in the jokes in the film itself, but in the entire film itself. Seinfeld reminded me of the acting, where he tries not to laugh at his jokes - they are boring, but if you do not take the film seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of actors, not characters. If you're looking for a random movie, and you love Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
