One of the most exciting documentaries in time, you'll see it at all. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate view of the political dynamics prevailing in the Western Hemisphere. While a key chapter in the story of the US-Latin-backed coup, this film chronicles what can happen when the poorest people are armed with political savvy and courage! <br /> <br /> The political ideas presented by this film are invaluable. One gets clear examples of private media, as a powerful force for collective deceit and propaganda. We see the poor Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American policy." One feels a clear sense of impending loss if people fail to deal with the blatant tyranny that the conspirators suddenly and illegally. We also see arrogance and fascism, support for private media, clerics, and CIA-backed generals who conspired to bring Venezuela back to Washington's hegemony. Although President Hugo Chávez has led efficiently, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly abducted by dissident generals. Their response is the highest point in the film. If one tries to get an excellent picture of what the US government, Hugo Chávez and Venezuela are all about, this is the film!
