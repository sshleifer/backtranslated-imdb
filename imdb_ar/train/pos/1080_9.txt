"Comedies" nowadays are usually 100 minutes of humor in the toilet and foul language and kicking. Modern comedies attract the lowest common denominator, the slow subterranean. Sure, a good comedy will appear from time to time, but it has become scarcer all the time. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings his dream home" explains what Hollywood was in the 1940s capable of achieving, which is blatantly funny. Jim and Murrell Blandings (Carey Grant and Merna Lowe) decided to build a house on the outskirts of Connecticut. The film follows their story, ranging from home fishing trips, home-baked construction, to the final home - through the zuzz-zuzz water disinfectant. <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are ideal for their roles, of course (Grant is especially funny because he watches the house costs out of control). However, the film was stolen by a wise lawyer in Blandings, played to perfection by the Milphyn Douglas. Douglas managed to steal every scene he saw, Farhana while Blandings watched from crisis to crisis. Reginald Dini as an architect in Blandings and Harry Shannon as a hard-boiled old water well is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie many times and it makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need an elevator, whether you're building a house or not.
