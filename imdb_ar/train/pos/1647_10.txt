Excellent. The real and wonderful picture of the pioneer farm life in the western plains with a focus on the role and status of women. Animated film, lovingly made, based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget, independent film; no money provided. Definitely not Hollywood's unrealistic romantic version of leading life.
