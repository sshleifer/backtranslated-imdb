E! TV is a wonderful channel and very funny soup, in a flash you can watch changing loops. We want more funny writing written by the best writer ever Stan Evans .. Pastor of the Stray Masses ... He is a truly talented writer, actor, playwright, producer, director and creative consultant. But he was not the billionaire $$$$ so he left him a billionaire. Many superheroes wanted to make films with actor Stan Evans, who plays the character of "Clark Gable." He must make many films. Perhaps with Steven Spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers. We wish him a moment of fame with great luck to win. Did he produce any fictitious play? Or maybe any docudrama ?? A project about Bernie Madoff will be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios? Is it under contract $$$$$$$$$$$$ billion contract with Disney? He must earn more than $ 50 million ... He can also write a TV movie about the late king of pop Michael Jackson. We want to introduce more and more Stan Evans in movies and on TV. Thank you so much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
