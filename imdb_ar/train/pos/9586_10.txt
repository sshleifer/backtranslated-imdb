The film really challenges the concepts of identity and society in which we live. It is well designed and very strong. People in the film are honest and reveal the world outside the normative ideological perspective. I think it gives a great insight into a subculture that shakes the same thoughts that a viewer has about society. It is sometimes shocking and more powerful because of it. It was difficult to observe some parts, as with reality, but it is not over yet. It's good the first time you see it, but it's better the second or third time, because you've had the chance to get around the topics they discuss and challenge.
