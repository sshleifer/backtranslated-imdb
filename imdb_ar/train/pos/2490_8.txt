There is no doubt that those in the era of "immediate satisfaction" of horror films will complain about the pace of this film and the absence of undue effects and the body count. The truth is that "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how to do independent horror movies. <br /> <br /> If you avoid independent shelves because you are tired of annoying teenagers or twenty something that kills some bad guys who can come back from the back of the Count Chocola box, "The Empty Acre" is the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> In the ruins of the American rural dream, "The Blank Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old child. With the breakdown of the weak couple's relationship, a larger story emerges in the background. At night, a dark, shapeless mass of arid, sun-shaded acres appears in their farm and seems to be devouring anything in its path, leaving no sign that it was there at all. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with mysterious characters and visual clues about what happens, ending with a well-executed ending that resonates with enough questions left to validate the writer / director's faith in an intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a subtext about the death of the American dream, but I hardly call it a symbolic story. The well-designed, technically-designed "The Empty Acre" is one of the great little characters that horror lovers must think about.
