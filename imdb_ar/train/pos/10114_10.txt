"The Haunted World of Edward Wood, Jr." is the final documentary about the life of a man who brought us films like "Glenn or Glenda", "The Bride of the Beast" and, of course, "Plan 9 of Outer Space." This great film goes far beyond other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion." Many of them have died since filming and offer a frank examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic for the fact that he looks back in the dark corner of Hollywood's old, emotional dealings with the director (up to the haunting music), this documentary is a must-have requirement for anyone who likes the director who failed that day. The two full hours of the film work on the love and retroactive effect of Ed's life and the sudden death of the viewer. Watch the best at 3 am while wearing an angora jacket.
