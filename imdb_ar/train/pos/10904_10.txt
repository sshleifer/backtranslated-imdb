The most exciting and truly open documentary. I cried all the way from start to finish. Watching the show is instantly captured by the struggle of the man to live without pain, to live a life we ​​take as a matter of course. The first time I heard the title, I was almost afraid to see the program, it was hard for me to understand living in suffering every day of my life. I really felt him. The most sad part of the documentary is when Johnny picks up his coffin. Can you imagine doing that? What's more, although he was suffering from unbearable pain, he is still opening his charity. (DEBRA) Johnny is one of the only people worthy of true respect and admiration, he is a definition of role model, who is a real hero can not be denied!
