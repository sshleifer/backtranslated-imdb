Elmer Vood laughs as he sits on his comfortable chair reading his comic book, while his dog sits comfortably in the vicinity of the fireplace. Everything peaceful until the flea comes bouncing. (Fleas in a farm-type outfit with a large Sombrero carrying a bag named "A. Flea"). Take out his binoculars and monitor the dog. (See a big shot of the dog's butt and flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-bone!" And then sings, "There's food around the corner; there's food around the corner!") This story puts this A cute but unpleasant flea tortures the poor dog. The buster is hilarious because it interacts with fleas. <br /> <br /> His huge teeth chirping drawings near the smart flea fleas and the dog's dialogue made me laugh loudly several times. This may be the craziest dogs I've ever seen in a cartoon! Poor poor, under the threat of having to shower, is not responding when stupid fleas cause him pain. It is almost painful to see fleas and use crushers, condoms and the like on a dog. He puts fireworks in behind the dog. It's brutal!
