I highly recommend this film. It is located in the future of Bladerunner-esquire of 2054 in Paris, which is mostly a classic film text Noir: a lady in danger, a sister trying to find her, an honest policeman fights everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotyped and combines a very good story with interesting innovative images. The movie may remind you of "City City" in its form, but it has a clearer look and a graphic and is really appealing. Each frame, each sequence seems to have been able to be pulled out of the office of a skilled graphic designer. For stories and artwork, you can find gestures dating back to the 1990s (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and films like Casablanca, as well as looking forward to a bleak future where our business is governed by companies. Make any excuse you need to watch this movie.
