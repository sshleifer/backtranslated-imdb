In 1928, the Russian immigrant filmmaker William Powell casts his epic on the Russian Revolution and employs a former general of the Tsarist regime Emile Janings to play the film. The two remake the drama and memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent) 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> Try what I might do, I feel it is hard to heat up to the "last command" of all its advantages. "The Docks of New York" was a wonderful film, and "Underworld" is a film I've longed for, but "The Last Command" is too heavy. The premise is fantastic, but the treatment is still a script script, with the exception of specific sequences in Hollywood, depicting a production line for plugins and bootable film production machinations with the latest technology. </ p> <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is, as expected, a wonderful Russian general, strikingly distinguished between the former, shocked and disoriented former general, indignant at his misery and the jolly and powerful officer in Yuri. <br /> <br /> The finish is great and well worth the wait, but to get there, you should be prepared to feel a bit bored at times.
