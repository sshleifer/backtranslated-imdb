True film lovers will love this original film. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who classify this movie as one star and describe it as unrealistic. Although I do not have the background or come from the heroes' environment, I spent many years working in low-income neighborhoods and the working class and felt that acting was real and representative of how teenagers behaved. I do not know what is the basis for others' comments that the film is "unrealistic." The dialog box is awesome. <br /> <br /> The low production value of the budget did not bother me a bit. I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the story of the story and the development of the character rather than on the presentation of Hollywood's attractive melodrama. <br /> <br /> I totally bought the person's motives and reactions. The representation was impressive and impressive for new and ineffective actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you enjoy good character dramas, look for them. <br /> <br /> (For negative commentators, "trolls": click on their names and you will not see that most of them do not have other reviews or negative reviews only)
