The previous reviewer has said that exactly. I saw him once, he was mesmerized, and I saw him again when he was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first broadcast. I still remember some scenes. The setting is the opening of the twentieth century, and the war referred to in the title is "World War I". One of the scenes was set in a women's section only in a public place, and this was an interesting historical observation. The moment that one of the other women touches is one of my great moments of film. I do not think this is a "gay" movie, it's an interesting and fascinating love story, where it happens that the two presidents are women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it came out on DVD.
