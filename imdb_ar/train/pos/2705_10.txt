This is the scenario that Ed Wood has been working on for 10 years trying to get it. Finally, Ares Ilyopoulos got the wooden film to film the scenario of saving him from his burning house at the expense of other precious things passing by. <br /> <br /> This is a film free of dialogue, and some might foolishly describe it. In fact, it's a totally noisy movie, without deadly chatter for most clicks. In the hands of these directors, music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any Hollywood scenario mill, especially as the stupid movie Billy Zane last was in "Watch Out!", "Oh no!" - J. Cameron. ... ick ...) I'll have the wonderful Zane mono communicative in this film on the blank dialogue on any day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zani heads a team of players who obviously wanted to be in this film. Ritchie Radiant As usual, the gods shine when you put the name of Sandra Bernhardt, Rick (y) Schroeder, Martha Kathy and Andrew McCarthy on the same label. <br /> <br /> Perfect design, In general, this is a chaotic and wild masterpiece lovingly designed by Ed Wood Jr., the author and filmmaker, and we must see for anyone who truly loves films in the way that Iliopulos and his actor are clearly doing. If you made it yourself.
