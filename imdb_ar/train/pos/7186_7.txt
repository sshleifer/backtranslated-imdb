There have been a lot of Zorro movies that have been produced over the past decades, but it's a shame that one of the best films may be one of the least watched. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is a little different from other Zorro movies. First, it is a republican series in 12 chapters. This time, Zorro does not play by the top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Bauer or Antonio Banderas, but instead is actor-like Reed Hadley. Although Hadley does not represent a strong presence in actions like others do, he does the right job, helping him not be the only hero here; as the title suggests, he has a fighting corps to call. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that setup is not California. The story takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, where a man who stands as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a group of outlaws to help him plan his overthrow of the newly created Mexican Republic. Something is planned, Zoro, and a handful of followers to do anything they can to stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment for each episode, from the "twang" bow to the sound effects of the funny representation. But overall, this is one of the best Republican serials of all time, and perhaps the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most serials and does not become incomprehensible or zigzag. There are so many exciting things - Indiana Jones fans will notice a lot of pieces borrowed from this series.
