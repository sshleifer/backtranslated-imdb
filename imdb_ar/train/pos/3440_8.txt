I love Rosario Dawson, I think she is one of the best actresses of modern times. <br /> <br /> It seems that getting down is about self empowerment more than anything else. It's a consistent swipe at everything in the film. The dialog box is flat, and the characters seem to be deliberately nice by one. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in characters and Rosario's journey of self-empowerment to loss of empowerment and return again. <br /> <br /> Making it classic for rape is inappropriate, and perhaps that's why so many people do not enjoy the film. Ordinary audience "rape" is not particularly favored this film, perhaps this is the point? The film poses more questions than answers, and faces the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a strong relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not applaud the audience with self-aggrandizement, it draws viewers to what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> Descent is a good film hard to severely assess his IMHO.
