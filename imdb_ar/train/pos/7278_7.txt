Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that hold you and do not leave them to the end, especially when you see them as a child. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to recognize that it is not all that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains a collection of great mysterious scenes (especially those involving the scary mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is None Doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in a new RV; the rock scene is very sexy and very scary. The scenes in which the main person discovers his mother's secret are very frightening. <br /> <br /> Well, acting in the film is not very great and the film sometimes looks a bit boring, but in general ghosts that are still walking are fun. Too bad a few people watched this movie, this film really deserves the best. I just want to say: Mr. Flickr, I've done a good job! You are Hollywood producers there; if you want to reproduce a movie, re-make this movie!
