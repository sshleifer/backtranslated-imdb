Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After discovering that her dead aunt left her some things, Elvira goes to England to receive her, hoping it will be some money. But for her horror, the Elephra discovers that her aunt has left her home, her dog and cookbook. Elvira decided to settle down at home anyway, but with its stunning dark features and stunning features, she would not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors now turn the whole town against her, and with the harsh attitude and the appearance of Elvira, everyone is watching because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun watching Elvira in all these adventures, it's great. The whole movie puts you in the mood for Halloween, of course, it's ridiculous and jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure watching it. I would like to give Elvira, dark mistress 8/10
