On December 28, 1895, in the history of Grand Café in Paris, the history of the film was written while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all individual shots, to a paid audience. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first film to be screened and I wish I were there, not only to watch the film, but also the audience's reactions. <br /> <br /> We start with closed doors from the Lumiere factory. Apparently, because the picture looks like a picture, people thought they would only see a slide show, not something they were hoping for. But then the doors open and people flock back to their homes. First a lot of women, then some men, and one man on a bicycle with a big dog. When all doors are closed again. <br /> <br /> Whether this is the first film or not (some say that "L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat" was the first recorded film of Lumière), is an impressive piece of cinema in the early days. Being bored with this is impossible for a variety of reasons. One simple reason: only fifty seconds long. But also for people who like special effects movies only, there must be something interesting here; you can not see historical things like this every day.
