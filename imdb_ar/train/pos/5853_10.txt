I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena and curtains and the overall look was interesting to me for some reason. Anyway, this could have been one of Summerslam's best games ever if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, and now it's time to have a fat man versus a strong man but I'm glad the times have changed. It was a major event, just as in every game Lugar was terrible. The other matches on the card were Razor Ramon, Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers, Heavenly Bodies, Shaw Michaels and Curt Hening. This was the event in which Shawn was appointed as a big monster for his personal guard Diesel, IRS for 1-2-3 Kid, Bret. Hart takes first, and then takes Jerry Loller and things with Hearts and Loller was always very enjoyable, then Ludwig Borga Marty Janetti was destroyed, and the giant Andreteker company Gonzalez faced another terrible match, Joking Jones and Tatanka on Pam Pamilo and Hedhrenkers. Yokozuna defended the world title Against Lex Luger this game was boring and had a terrible end. However it is worth 8/10
