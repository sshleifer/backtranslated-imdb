I read a lot of comments that I also shared about remembering this movie and I wanted to see it again but I did not know the name of the film. Luckily, because of doing the research and finding the address on this site, I read the comments that I left here and realized that this was the movie I remembered. I then searched and found the movie and I was very happy to be able to see the movie again after 40 years. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I managed to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well. The VHS version of "Call it Courage" was in a Disney world that included two films, the second being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." I have now felt as much as 40 years ago and now have my own version of it. I think it is only available on VHS. I found this on the ebay site and saw several copies of it there. Enjoy it, I know I did! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle who cared for him. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the eagle boy was fired because he was not allowed to kill. After forcing the boy to leave the tribe for punishment after liberating the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more, taught him how to survive. The rapprochement between the boy and the eagle in the wild was moving and the photography was really wonderful. What a wonderful era this was. I have not seen anything so close to this movie!
