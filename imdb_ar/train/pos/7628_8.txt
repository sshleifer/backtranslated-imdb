This movie is one of those "WOW!" Movies. Not because it is the greatest film of all time, but because it surprised me. It was not just a TV movie, but it was on Elvis. I can safely say the greatest number of assholes because there was only one Alves, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russell became very close to being the real thing. It was one of the greatest representations I have ever seen. He had my belief that he was really his. I learned a lot about Elvis life from watching this movie. And do not lead the television part of it lets you stray - it's actually a really wonderful movie! Kurt Russell could have been twins for Elvis :)
