Do you want to solve the puzzles? Do you like complex novels? This is for you. A wonderful film, clever by Francis Leclerc (the son of the legendary French Canadian striker Felix LeClerc). The exhilarating image and intelligent editing is the word Leclerc, helped by the powerful Roy Dubois who plays the leading role. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Alexandre Tourneur, a veterinarian in his forties who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by an unknown person. Tornor struggles to remember who hit him as he ends the suffering of the deer on the road. Throughout the struggle, he has a strange behavior and seems to have something taken over. <br /> <br /> It's not a scary movie, but it's very mysterious and well played. I have my hypothesis on the end (I think the Indian caused the accident) but this end was open to any explanations. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommend 9.5 / 10
