Home Room deals with a colombian-like school portrait in high school, but instead of dispensing with the event itself, the film depicts what happened, what happened to the survivors, their trauma, their guilt and their denial. <br /> <br /> * The spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no movement footage of a non-SWAT commando paramilitary reaction after the shooting of a high school killer. The film contains three heroes. Investigators investigating the crime, in which none of the culprits were found guilty, and two teenage girls who survived the incident, played by two very young girls from Erika Christensen and Posey Phillips. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing to do with the images being released together and the drama that followed. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although there are only 24 people around the block to the extent that film viewers are aware of her strong and reliable acting style. Phelps, who was three years older than Kristensen and unknown to me, was amazed by the sheer power of the screen. This girl was the main part. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful film and is linked to you by its intimate focus on the fragile and growing relationship between the two shocked girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) looks good, but it seems almost superficial compared to the Home Room when it comes to taste and drama. What I can see this movie only gets a little screen time and exposure - much more loss to America that suffers from psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
