First of all, the reget is fabulous. Good comedy and mystery stirring at the same time. A lovely mix of the strange "Creed" style of storytelling with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no "end." To me this is unacceptable. I was thinking ... How would it be possible to continue the story without Helmer's lessons? ... I have some idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure that Part III without Helmer will not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mabel is a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes the experience. So why not make a small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create a puppet-animated cartoon (for example, "The American Team" from Trey Parker) or even three-dimensional animation on a computer. I know it's not like the real actors, but in principle I think it can work ... Only in this way can actors be activated again. For Riget fans, this should not be a big difference - if the animation is done well, the normal "observer" will be normal after a few shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. It is quite understandable that Riget 3 can not be created with actors these days. So why not play with animation? And ... Look for the possibilities it offers you! So one marketing! A great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using a puppet animation. Only dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 days ... or even to see text only. I'm curious how the story ends ... and as I expect - everyone here is doing. <br /> <br /> Greetings, slaj <br /> <br /> Note: I am not talking about the "kingdom" of the hospital "by Stephen King ;-)
