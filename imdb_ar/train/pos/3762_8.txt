Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves come back from San Damas, who are sent on another trip because someone from the future feels exactly the way they did in the first film. The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. When they meet with Grim Reber, they get a chance after age to play it to get a chance to return and prevent the two evil robots from destroying the future they were supposed to have. Besides playing their roles ... ... perfect, they are also playing (and reviving additional sales in the process) some classic games (I even have an original Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I like this movie better than the original is that it deals with "what might be the case" instead of "what it was". Without spoiling the film, I can not give you information about it (I think you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
