I've been a fan of pushing daisies from the start. It's been thought out wonderfully, and Brian Fuller has the most prominent ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable how much TV needs from a creative original show like "Push Daisies." It is a great pleasure to see an offer, unlike the rest, where, if compared to some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you will see similarities, which are tedious in the moments of viewing the shows very close to their identity. <br /> <br /> With great performances, great text and delight in every episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most popular shows on your TV.
