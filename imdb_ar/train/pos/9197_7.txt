This is actually a gorgeous little flick, absolutely no budget is made with a clear clipping on the video curl. Take some time to warm it up. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a magician-like charm. After a few scenes, stop noting the embarrassing lines or sound that has been tested in some deliveries. All characters develop a quirky charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, the Maidens is the guy that I've been playing for mentally ill. He seems to enjoy it very much! The scenes of Gore Madness and Zombie Shit are mixed with some visually effective shots of the title character, Midnight Skier walking around the campus with a black headdress, looking for the whole world like a cross between the Grem Reber and the Say, Silver Surfer. These snapshots make the sometimes silly things that characters say about Skater look almost ominous. The soundtrack features some of the most interesting Garage-Punk tunes and its crisp, loud medium, which fits well with the mood of the film. Excellent rookie, I say.
