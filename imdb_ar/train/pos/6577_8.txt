With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays have disappeared from the theater these days. The arc is too large, it seems very operative to be the general judgment. This version of the BBC (BBC) is one of Shaw's most enjoyable plays. It's definitely a tacky arch, but it's also awesome. Because of the quality of the British theater, it is ideally portrayed with actors - perhaps except for most of us who have never heard of it - except Helena Bonham Carter. Carter is as wonderful as the Bulgarian girl who hosts the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and is later in love with him. One might argue with the funny interpretation of Sergus (Patrick Raikart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge to the enemy and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role calls for over-representation and Ryecart was obviously over-effusive. Other players are the perfect message. Carter as the astonishing Bulgarian "aristocrat" and "Torinese" as the soldiers of Swiss wealth in the center of the play, of course, they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a shot. But you are unlikely to see Shaw's film betraying its origin. The plots are generally clever. However, Xu is all about dialogue. Work is minimal (even in St. Joan) and non-physical collections. Enjoy this for what it is.
