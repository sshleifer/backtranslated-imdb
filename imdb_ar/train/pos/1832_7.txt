I saw two films at the end of the week, one of which was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in Bollywood, but they are different. The main difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw presented his indelible mark with "Ankeen", one of India's best comedy films. His casting of Charecteres is perfect. The story is apparently taken from the Gujerati play, fantastic, wonderful treatment with some exceptions. In Bollywood when a movie is put together, the first thing a Bollywood director can do is record a way out of the music and that person (the average owner in this case) is obliged to fill six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease Finacier and his grandmother who can not get enough of these numbers. There is no music outlet that can produce good songs relentlessly as is evident in this film. None of the songs contain any sound, and they clearly delineate the narration of the story except the background music and Western version of Natyam. Fencing and roles that play the role of father and son are a good act by Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt sights are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds good actors and is ready to wait until a good story arrives as in this wonderful film. Then we have a cheap tasteless product like Shahrukh Khan who will go down to encourage a trash can like Cal to enrich himself at the expense of improving art, and surround themselves with the talents of the border strip, and recover. Invest before you get the floor. These are the Bollywood locusts who are planning an unexpected audience for the "Knight Movie" awards given by Bollywood Chamsha and most of them in the media.
