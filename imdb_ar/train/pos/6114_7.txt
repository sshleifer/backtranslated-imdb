It's a really great movie and has some similarities with the 2001 film "My Sassy Girl," but it's able to charm most of the time. Big applause should go to the prospects. Ha-Neul Kim Sweet and Strange At once, Sang-woo Kwon is attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG plugins to highlight the images and offers impressive fighting scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I loved it a lot more here than in the High Volcano. This boy has a future - those looks, fighting techniques, and romantic leadership. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can make it short: a beautiful movie. My rating: 7/10
