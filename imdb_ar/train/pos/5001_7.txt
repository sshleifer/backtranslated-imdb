Ardman does it again. Beside Pixar, Aardman Animation repeatedly demonstrates how to do animation correctly. <br /> <br /> I spent a wonderful time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for the American public. My only fear is that most fans will not get a sense of humor in this show. <br /> <br /> After you were a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew what I was when I sat down to watch this. Animation artists have done a great job of matching pre-recorded sounds with perfect matching animals. Look at the first episode with the goat, who appears stoned, and the dogs on the street that continue to communicate with each other "Doug". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not by long shot. In fact, I'll be happy to see the last show for the entire season. But as I said before, the masses will not understand it.
