I liked the movie. Twist Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my best favorite actors and one of the best actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I have seen most of her films but all of Jeremy Jordan. The thing I do not like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is caught and "Jennifer" criminalizes him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite film. My first is goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
