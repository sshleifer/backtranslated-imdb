Valentine's Day is now one of my favorite bright films. Death scenes are meticulous and most acting acts are good. Marley Shelton has performed wonderfully as a female lead (much better than Jennifer Lov Hewitt in "I Know ..."). David Burinaz, the main reason I saw him in this film, had a small role, but he played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. It was awful in this. It was the only scene I was happy to see * SPOILER * The scene of her death. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before watching "Screech" or "Know ..." again.
