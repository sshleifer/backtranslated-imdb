The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic and will not act like the other hackers who comment on this film. <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie did not do "you have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very good, the acting was great and the filming was great! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I think this may be a mistake in recording a DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely be out of the recording. Other films produced by Brain Damage Films ! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, representatives and staff, thank you!
