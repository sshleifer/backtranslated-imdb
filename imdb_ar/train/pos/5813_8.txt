This movie is awesome. <br /> <br /> Now, I like to have my films heavy on story and dialogue, but every now and then, something like Moonwalker comes, which is similar, despite many flaws. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than Michael Jackson's ad. From the fatal video of "Man in the Mirror," a montage listing his achievements and small parts of his career, he goes through all the high levels of his life, and then collides with a really amusing piece that serves as a funny music video for "Bad" "And" Speed ​​Demon ", after the adventures of MJ running from the fans of the obsessed mania, and then finally dancing on rabbit uniforms. Traffic is not as bad as some think. It's acceptable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the great video clip for "Let Me Alone" and directly to the main feature. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is laughable. very funny. We see Michael coming out of a building, then being called thousands of soldiers. Then we hit the flash buck, and we showed the MJ and three children stumbling on the underground hideout. "Big Mr." (Joe Bisky) is a wicked villain who has a plan to make every child in the world drug addict "(no details are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl that is with falling, then chased ... Yada Yada Yada. The plot is not really the important part. We get two very wonderful sequences where MJ turns into a car, then into a robotic spacecraft, and of course the amazing sequence of "Smooth Criminal". <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie, but it's a great movie for anyone who likes MJ. It contains most of its greatest successes, some nice little parts, and some very good special effects (especially the Robot / Spacehip sequence) worth it, especially as if you can pick it up for an additional fee on eBay. The kids will stay quiet for a few hours, plus the 20 most things they had when they were first released.
