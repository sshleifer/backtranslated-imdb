I will be honest, I finally checked this movie not because of the stars - although they were particularly elaborate and attractive, especially the three threads - or even the disguised story of a breakthrough in the Presidential Secret Service (something, I've been told through DVD extras for this The show, it has not happened yet, assuming it's true, it's great!). I got it because it was directed and has the option of embossing by Detective Milderic Lewis !! Well, well, Clark Johnson, one of my fans from the movie "Murder: Life on the Street" and a veteran TV director (mostly). I would say he is doing as well as he can with a fun but somewhat average project, despite the odds. <br /> <br /> Veteran and secret agent Betty Garrison (Michael Douglas) has discovered that both of them are taking his own shot and killing his friend, targeting one Air Force helicopter and detonating it for Prez. (David Rasche, does anybody remember "a heavy hammer"?). His relationship to the first lady (Kim Basinger, obviously one of the first warm ladies we passed, fictional or real) certainly does not help. He got all of the real mole into service and avoided the hound like hunting for his best former friend and fellow agent and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, still almost completely in the "24" position). Get rid of some of the other key service agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy, hard to buy like Eva Longoria's bug) and shady foreign figures and you have a fairly standard political excitement that does not aim to achieve their highest levels, as you say, if frustrating, results. <br /> <br /> The summary line is the best way to describe how this view is displayed without giving spoilers. DVD extras seemed to me richer and more interesting than the movie, although the film itself was fun enough to interest most of them (including my characters).
