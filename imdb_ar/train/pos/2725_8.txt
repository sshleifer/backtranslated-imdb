The film "In Cold Blood," directed by director Richard Brooks of the famous Truman Cabot novel, deals with the senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of unhappy criminals. The film excels as a personal study of the killers, particularly the trigger of Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The actor has a few known names but they bring the story to life easily. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent as criminals with different personalities. They play each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore the specifics of his character. The rest of the staff is just average and not worth the observation. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his text and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script misjudges some incorrect accounts in later stages. Cinemas nominated for the Academy Award by Conrad Hall are also top notch, as well as editing. Noteworthy is the dazzling result of the Quincy Jones Award that has received the latest four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this film does not shine violence. Brooks turns the killers into lamentable characters rather than decisively condemning them. Whether you agree with this feeling or not, the film offers an interesting alternative to Hollywood's usual approach. I recommend the film for this reason as well as the expertise that is dealt with.
