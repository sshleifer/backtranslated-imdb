What people fail to understand about this film is that it is not just a beginning, a middle or an end, it is just the culmination of a 26-episode long television series. So remember that when you talk about how to explore the world enough. All this was done on the TV show. <br /> <br /> As far as it is gorgeous and stunning like the visual images, I think *** *** SPOILERS argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what made me really love this movie. Seeing the characters I had followed through a 26-episode fight like this was painful, seeing Gwizdo walk sadly on his own among the floating ruins while honing Lian-Chu's blade was almost shaking. <br /> <br /> Then we get a complete contradiction with Lian-Chu fighting these madly brilliant dragons (which appeared before in this series) while Gwizdo threatens insanely and indirectly to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene is not mentioned more in the warnings. Any child who has a lick of sensation will be able to see that the guy was not himself and was perfectly determined to choke that little girl. That was enough to upset me, and I'm 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world was wonderful, the plot was much better than most multi million movies, and it was a great way to see some of the favorite characters you go. check it out. :)
