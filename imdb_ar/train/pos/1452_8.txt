Being a New Yorker implanted, I may be more important than most in watching the City Hall. But I have to say that even before reaching the same story, I was fascinated by the location and political atmosphere of New York City, created by director Harold Baker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to Woerner's Restaurant. In Brooklyn where political director Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I was living in New York again in 1996. This was actually particularly favored by politicians in Borough although they had several other hangouts. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the script was co-authored by Nicolas Pelleg who still writes stories of organized political crime. He knows the atmosphere well and is sure he knows how these two worlds cross as they do in this film. <br /> <br /> The investigator played by Nestor Serrano goes to an informal meeting with a relative of mob leader Anthony Franciosa, and three people disappear, including a 6-year-old innocent boy whose father used to go to school. The story multiplies, and in the end it is reached within the city hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack, deputy mayor of Louisiana, a state with a tradition of good corruption itself. He is the outsider here, and in an attempt to control the damage, Kozak finds more than he bet on. <br /> <br /> Danny Aylo plays the role of political director in Brooklyn Frank Anselmo, and for those who are not from New York, The late Burrow Chief of Queens Donald Manis also dropped a scandal. He is the kind of politician in Brooklyn whom I knew on that day that his friendship was the organized crime and the favorites they had made for them. <br /> <br /> The City Hall was the farewell show of Anthony Francius, one of the most disdainful and ever-appreciated talents on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever it works. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the Pacino are when he is at the funeral of the murdered little child, taking action and turning it into a political triumph for himself. He has a complex part, he is a decent enough man, but someone trapped in the corruption that is required in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know the political life of Big Apple, City Hall is strongly recommended.
