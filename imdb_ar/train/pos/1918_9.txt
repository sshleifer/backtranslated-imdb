I'll be honest with Yall, I was young in high school when I broadcast this first sitcom on ABC I did not think I would ever like it. But with John Ritter in it, I felt that she had a simple potential in it, plus it was something else I loved. The acting was great, not many of the horrible second-rated comedy lines, where John Ritter always brings game A when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father, who never watched comedy series, watched films, sports, law and order. He sat with my three brothers, my sister, my sister and my mother and saw the show I thought was because of John Ritter. I honestly think that this show will continue to run if John Ritter God raises his spirit and I hope he has not passed away.
