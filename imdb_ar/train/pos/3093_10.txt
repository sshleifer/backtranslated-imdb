Why did producers not give the opportunity of this offer among all the junk on TV, why did not give producers a chance for six degrees? Will the series continue in the video? I like to see how it ends. Put the first season on the video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of six degrees and I waited for her return. I set my recorder on the bar of all presentations. Praise be to Allaah for that. I discovered that the offer had been canceled and I was disappointed. I wish I knew it would be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was developing some depth in the characters. The writing was also very good. Stephen (Campbell Scott) is my favorite all the time. I'm so sorry to see her go!
