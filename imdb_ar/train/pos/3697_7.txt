I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on the cable in the late afternoon. You may say "Who loves the sun" is the perfect hobby for a story, why not do it at all. You can hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will, Molly Parker is Maggie, and Adam Scott is Daniel (is he friend, foe or fiance), next to a lake The scenic Falcon, Manitoba, Canada, was captured in graphic formulations, adapted in summer colors against the sun and shadows. The trio supports two other family members in this nascent mix: Wendy Crosson is Mary's mother Mary, and R. Thompson is Arthur Arthur Bloom. The writer and director Matt Bisonit gave a brilliant presentation of the story line and its various links, but need not worry, Hace may have a "unscrupulous" face, but the humor will come as Parker and Scott enter the Circle of Friends reunion. The dialog boxes may be tied or even nothing, however, we will get the flavor of what is cooked, confused or wondering. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the sun" can be classified as a sleeping gem. Chemistry is made up of all five gels and "combustion", giving a strong performance in the group. After all, everything in the family, the film certainly does not take itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> The official site appears to be still available on "wholovesthesun.com", and there is information about the soundtrack by Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar and string tunes) where the excerpts of the result are played, behind the scenes production notes, an interview with Writer and director Bisonite producer on how the movie appearance, concept, acting and more. We have always appreciated Molly Parker for her stunning professional performance in 1996's "Kissed" by Lynn Stobkoish, who is married to Bisonette, who wrote "The Maggie Molly" part.
