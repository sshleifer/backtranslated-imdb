This movie did not have fun parts, most of them are just funny units on average, but did not have any parts that were too bad. The worst part was the voice of the master. Stray was just slury just for me. About 5 minutes in I was fed up with hearing his talk. Apart from the annoying lazy sound the film was good. There were many side jokes that if you catch them make the movie much better. It's a good movie for kids. It contains enough to keep adult content inside to entertain children. This is definitely worth leasing if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
