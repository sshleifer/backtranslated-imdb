The story revolves around a little girl who grew up in colonial Africa, but much more. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the South will test the same things. Longing for another, one of a different race, can not be completed. So look banned. No words required. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a black servant, Isaach De Bankolé and a white woman, Aimée. Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not have one another. <br /> <br /> The little girl, France (Cecile Ducas), is the only one spending all her time with Protey. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most irritating aspects of the film is lazy colonialists. They can not even take off their clothes to sleep by themselves. There is a world about to end; they just do not know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit Africa. Sounds very calm. Especially at night when you only hear animals.
