Is this the future that awaits us? The land is overcrowded, unforgiving with a Hellfire, undesirable? This film brings to mind the problem still plaguing us, as this number has doubled since the movie was introduced in 1973. Let's hope that the world will not end like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie I enjoyed Do it a lot. He had charismatic characters, an almost appalling situation, an attractive and thought-provoking story, and a muscular man out: Charlton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very bad feeling. You almost suffocate with the foul smell of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charlton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. The man created this role of poking, but a strong man loved. I certainly can put myself in Thorne shoes. He sees that something is not true, but everyone around him either does not listen (he pays more for not listening) or wants his death. Edward J. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P) the role of old beloved Sol, who had enough of this bad place. Everyone else is wonderful, especially Lee Taylor Young as Cheryl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment where she lives. <br /> <br /> The special effects are wonderful, until 1973. The Soylent Green factory, future apartments, especially the "shovels" (bulldozers that dispose of people) were excellent. The air polluted outside seems disgusting and very unpleasant. The empty streets of the city, full of desperate and violent people, are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> A final note is the end, which still shocks me. It's horrible, but if you think about it, it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: <br /> <br /> The flick of science fiction in the 1970s makes you think and leave you feeling very uncomfortable.
