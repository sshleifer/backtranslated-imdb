Another silent love triangle film of Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, the pace and photography is very good. Seamless boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits boxer "One Round" by Carl Brisson to be his partner in the sparring, partly to keep Mabel (Liliane Hall-Davis) nearby but fickle. There are a lot of actors and dignitaries at the wedding of Jack and Campbell, where the anomaly stands, standing in the church gallery, the shock recorder when seeing the tall and very short stature, fat lady, conjoined twins, of course, argued about any aspect of the corridor to sit, It is amusing. The rest of the film lost Jack Maple and boxing on his way to her heart, or something like that. It was a very late afternoon, with the audience wearing evening clothes, while boxers also wore their clothes when they came out of the ring. Camera angles, frequency, use of symbols, and cutting? All very elegant and clever. Working camera editing and the latest boxing game is very sweeping. Brisson's good appearance is well used in this; his smile does not smile at what's going on around him, as in The Manxman of Hitchcock, and that's not annoying. But can boxers have such boils?
