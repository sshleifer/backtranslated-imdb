One of my favorite movies. She has it all - the swing soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, the former Motorhur, a lot of excitement, lots of laughter, the completely ridiculous plot and the eighteen brilliant themes as characters. Eddie, the gentle young man who just wants to be left alone to become different, Leslie (as wet as they come), Knock (burning rock), Mom Eddie (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzie as the preacher (surely he is in America?) . Then there are the boys (the rich, the wicked and the stupid) and the girls (vacant, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, a mix of stunt rock for the 80s that you can think of. What about this rocket firing guitar? Then there is a scene where Sami the old lady pulls through the television screen and smashes it. And what does Roger do? Why, hovering her, just like a good geek would. My favorite scene is where Tim Henney gets his long-overdue reward from Sammi through the wet finger in the magic element! <br /> <br /> If you're in a rock in the 80s or like silly movies like I do, then check out this one. They are available on DVD and are very cheap so (trick or) treat yourself.
