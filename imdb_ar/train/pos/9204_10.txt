The story of Herr Rama Hare Krishna came to the mind of Dave Anand when he saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he was on a visit after protests against former Prem Bogary in Calcutta. He was low in morale because his film was opposed to others and burned the posters of Prem Bogary. But the life of the hippies sparked a story in Dave's mind to be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> This was the best effort in directing Dave Anand. The film was very successful at the box office and the safety features of Emma Dave had a tremendous impact. <br /> <br /> This movie was Dave Anand's call to the nation to maintain its moral values. <br /> <br /> It is about an Indian family based in Monterrey and the role of the brother is very affectionate to his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate Brashant (Dave) with the mother and Jasper (Zenat) with the father. She was repeatedly told that her mother and brother had died and that in the end she believed she would never see Prashant. <br /> <br /> She was abused by her mother as she ran away from home. Dave grew up to be a pilot, and taught that Jasper in Kathmandu with some hippies. <br /> <br /> To reunite with his sister, Dave travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (excellent) who would later marry him and also Janice who is actually Jasper with a new name and a new identity. I forgot her childhood and Dave too. <br /> <br /> Dave must recover his sister from all other events that include suspicion of being a thief in Kathmandu and people after his life. <br /> <br /> This story was well directed and acted by Dave Anand. We see more than more safety accessories than excellent. But Rahul Dave Burman's music was well composed. Dave initially offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dave Burman, but Burman da did not want Dave to act as the film. He was very close to Dev and his former film Prem Pujari, although he was good, but he was opposed to him in Calcutta. Borman da wanted Dave to try out a lighter subject where he thought the Hippie movie could spark people's anger against Dave. But Dave continued the film that reassures Borman da and the film was really successful. <br /> <br /> R D Bormann had made Asha Bhussel sing the award-winning Dom Maru Dom. Kanchi Ri Kanchi was another good figure. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie.
