When I was 17 years old, my high school organized goodbye bye - not a big surprise, as it is an ideal material for high school and is best known as the world's most performing musician. <br /> <br /> I was a musician. The student kept strong memories of production and songs, as well as a long-term disregard for the Dick Van Dyke film that Elvis deliberately obscured and set up with a swinging audience in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> So, when the 1995 version of Jason Alexander hit the cable TV screen, I was happy to see what I saw. Alexander becomes an exceptional performer like Albert, a performance that is in sharp contrast to his well-known character from a television series. The rest of the crew is amusing and convincing in their roles (perhaps China Phillips is the only one who does not look at her side, she is supposed to be a naive and innocent pupil). <br /> <br /> But the best thing about it is musical all the familiar numbers of the play are saved in this movie and performed as the musical songs should play (allowing no stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and the few of them do not know), then check out this telemovie. Does the stage show justice in a way that maybe can not be improved, which is good for me. What is better than presenting a writer's work honestly, with colors and style?
