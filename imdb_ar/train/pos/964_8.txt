"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film written by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it is likely to be a bit dark and scary for young people. However, older children may eat this thing, that is if you play Madbalij in English. <br /> <br /> The story is the story of a young boy, moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after the divorce. During the village festival, the boy is chosen to be a "kerin racer", which is a great honor, but with this honor comes a lot of danger and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil deeds are within reach as a woman in a small white skirt, go-go shoes and a bee-hive, as a team with a wicked Yokai to turn people's resentment and neglected things against them. This evil was manifested as a city flying in the form of a monster heading to the city of anger itself, Tokyo. One of the very funny scenes has two viewers watching the beast fly over the city ... Someone says, "Oh, it's just Jumeirah." <br /> <br /> The young man has established a friendship with Yukai, monsters of some kind, most of them benign, isolated themselves from humans, and all of Japan's Yokai are working together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & Crew took the Yukai films in the late 1960s / early 1970s and turned them into a modern adventure film for children (older people) that also brings together some exotic mechanical monsters that made me think of Transformers. The film's shape and feel are wonderful, the effects amusing, and will only sail some humor over the heads of the children, but still, may be enjoyed by the elderly. For adults, there's not much you do not like. If you're a fan of Japanese monsters, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Fantastic and fun things, kind of dark at times but maybe this is just Miike .. and what a wild trip. 8 of 10.
