Holes is a wonderful movie to see. Contains good messages in, such as: Be a good friend, never give up, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone. I still say that the book is better than the film, but the film gives the book money for money. Also, plays Khleo Thomas Zero. That really adds to it! Haha !!!
