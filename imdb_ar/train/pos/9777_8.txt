One of the best low budget movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of a new era? If you believe in mysticism, please do not watch this movie! Blow all your positive fantasies away. This film shows that outside the peaceful facade of spiritual research lies a world of extreme transgressions and terrorism. Hope there is a 35 mm version soon! Andreas Marshall's first film is just the beginning of a new region, where he makes films with a few euros I'm waiting for the second strike!
