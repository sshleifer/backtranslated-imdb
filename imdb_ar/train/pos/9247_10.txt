I was expecting this film to be a love story in 1930. A boy meets a girl, falls in love, a boy loses a girl, a boy wins her in the end. This was not the case at all. Clark Gabell plays the mastery artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and lifting the browful. He hid from the police when he broke into Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow), to find her covered with bubbles in the bathtub, at least. Instant Chemistry. It's hard to get for a while, but the girl can only resist this smile for a long time. The heat between them is clear, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When the job of extortion is over and Robbie ends up in a mobile home for "troubled girls," she is miserable, thanks to the fact that Eddie will not come for her, thanks to the intimidation she gives her. Harlow plays Robbie's role in talking very quickly. It does not allow Gable to get all the good fonts! There is a particularly moving scene where their "song" plays on the piano, which is ideally represented. The last fifteen minutes make me cry every time. Really sweet romantic.
