If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This film features pleasant rhythms, MJ as a robot, and a crazy transient plot. I remember a lot of the night, and I go to this wonderful film in the college, and I think in the minds of everyone who decided to light the green light this ridiculous piece. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of singing. Lots of dancing. There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ kills them as you expect when it comes to these things. But there is a lot to this film. There is mud. There are fat children (mud). There is a stereotypical rabbit Michael Jackson must play in a dance (obviously also clay). There is also a Pesci atmosphere (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - We love you Michael! It is a sad day for all of us.
