Perhaps "SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was one of the three most beautiful films I have ever seen. He did not win the Oscars, and I will not shed tears. This movie is of some kind, winning an Oscar may be detracting from it !!! My best friend Anders (Nyberg), I have done a real splendor with your pen here! Kay Pollack, with your creativity, and everyone who contributes, have all been given a gift of love for our world. Among the points of entry into this world, then out of it - you can really say you made it better! A special person thank you from my soul to all of you, that you have restored some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden and formed my small mind and being present and formed through many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. Blessing with gratitude to all of you. With Love and Light, George Gabriel Perkowitz Soehler, Johannesburg, South Africa
