I can not believe that people are looking for a plot in this movie. This is L'Oreal and Hardy. It actually eases. These were riots. Their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word from any of the mouth and they were able to keep the masses in stitches. Comedy was not sophisticated in any way. If the pillow can not make you smile, there is no reason to see any of the things these guys did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a conspiracy. I think it takes a simple mind to enjoy these things, so I'm qualified. Two teams of comedy do not count, we are very sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
