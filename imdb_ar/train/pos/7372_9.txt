"This is not a love song" is a wonderful example of the type of stalking that many people believe has a latent meaning. Love may be between the two main characters more than brothers. I think that Heaton is fond of Spike, but Spike is too naive to see him. <br /> <br /> I really feel that this is being filmed with scenes such as the sequence of back and letter writing. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spike's top letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the movie is shown, the reviewer does not seem to fully understand the film, so they do not even mention that Hyton may have sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some reviewers did not recognize her when they used phrases such as: "Who is Heaton? What is he doing late with Spike?" This person, however, may have hit a nail on the head with their statements. Spike shows remarkable signs of the presence of A.D.D, although I do not think this person realized that, because he seems to be using the word "retard" as an insulting term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Even though they are not for the faint of heart. The film depends on the overly personal, after the shooting until the end there is not much dialogue but between the two heroes. Unless you are used to watching such deep and courageous films, stay away.
