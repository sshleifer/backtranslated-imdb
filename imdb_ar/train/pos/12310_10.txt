Just read the original story written by Bo in the eighteenth century. It is amazing that the film despises the original soul well, although the plot has been greatly modified. The film's language, rhythm and special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still Chinese essence. It is amazing how Hark Tsui managed to bring them together. The result is pure beauty.
