Combo etc. Two stars of the greatest century singers playing together in this musical play underestimated them. He writes music, wrote lyrics, and both work for Basil Rathbone, who can not write either because his wife is dead (in fact she has looked fat!). The best scene is the pawn shop number where Bing sings an improvised number while the rock band is clearing its instruments. Just wonderful and this is a rare role in the legend of Broadway, Mary Martin, which is very good. Charlie Griffin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levante (again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram participated. Who knew Rathbone could be funny?
