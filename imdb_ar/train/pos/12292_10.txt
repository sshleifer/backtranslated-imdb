I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... Almost everything has already been told about the film, but there are one details I would like to highlight: No screenshots of the real hotel that still stands du Nord (do you still? It had to be demolished ...) It was used for the film - the whole scene was reconstructed on a set, the main reason being that they could not stop traffic on St. Martin's Channel for several weeks.
