I saw this movie for the first time when I was a high school student and the movie has stopped with me over the years. It's not about soundtracks, cinematography, or even dialogue and bad representation. It's about educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important one. It is not sin to have a child when you are a teenager and still in high school. This is not really bad, but it is a problem. Many of the girls I know now have children, and I think they have never seen this wonderful film, and if they do, it's clear they did not get the message behind it. It is about not taking risks when you are in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a fairy tale. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but you have to back down in your future because you have a child that thinks first. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a clear message behind it: JUST Say NO!
