I bought this DVD at first because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, Hey! Another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, I did not know that Aishwarya will appear only in the number of material in the last quarter of the film in a song she shares with SRK and help bring his character that is in the film for only about 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about mother's love and bearing. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, old age, and the introduction to knowledge and embrace the harsh realities of life. The number of the element in which SRK and Aishu appear is not related to the movie. It is actually a sequence of dreams that happens while the drunken personality of the SRK has been lost unconsciously. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is the amazing girl on the street who shows up in his favorite resting place one day, wears faded clothes and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is "Ishq Kamina" (loosely translated as "Love a a bitch!") And it is just hot smoking! do not miss.
