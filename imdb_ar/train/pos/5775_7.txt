Come on people, look at the title! Haha! I remember watching this movie late Saturday. It flicks from the wonderful cowardly beast with its hilariously mischievous representation and two magnificent resonant hills that add to the headache factor. 2 Rented boat rental guys are the movie! LOL, and you will love the sight of the boat where the Englishman and his wife talk about all the stars and it is midday and sunny. Hilarious hilarious! You can say that they did not care about the plot but wanted to film it as soon as possible. Bottom line, you will love her if you love the seventies.
