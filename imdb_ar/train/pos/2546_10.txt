This is exactly the same league as "Black Cat", although I will give this figure 9 instead of 9+. This is really a compliment to a movie that has been so underestimated that it is stunning! <br /> <br /> "The Invisible Ray" is part of horror and partial drama and part of science fiction. For a film produced in 1936, science fiction elements were good before their time. The combination of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect combination, while the representation of Lugosi and Karlov can not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hiller captures many of the elements embodied by James Will and has done so often. What I am saying is that this film is very strange. The gargle scene outside the Lugosi room is an ideal example of mood. It is a prominent moment in the film, unfortunately missing in today's films of this kind. <br /> <br /> As with "The Black Cat" and "Island of Lost Souls", I can not understand why this movie has not yet been released on DVD. When you consider moving some of the junk files that have already been transferred to a DVD, this is very confusing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you get the chance. When it is released to a DVD, you can grab it quickly and place it in a discreet place within the DVD library.
