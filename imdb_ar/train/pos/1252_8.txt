The infinite limits of our inhumanity to our kind never fail in my mind. This truly stunning story for a largely abused and largely inaudible population is a powerful, documented and outrageous story. As an American, I am constantly insulted by my country's behavior and this is just another example of a long list of international deprivation. We suck. Maybe this is John Pilger's first documentary I saw, but he immediately made me want to see what he did. My only complaint, the reason I made this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this terrible farce and cooperation between the US and UK governments, and asks us to share / share citizens in our non-commitment ... but make no suggestion about how Help. I do not know about Britain, but America has made it impossible for citizens to participate in the work of their government. A gesture in the right direction may help the cause of the inhabitants of these islands.
