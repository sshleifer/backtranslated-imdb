This film has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, and the dialogue is excellent (usually) (although it may lose exaggerated sound), the direction and cinematography are surprisingly good, although some tests do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geeky boy, always a geeky boy. The sad truth is that he is unable to play anything but Fox Mulder. He positions, tries to have a spot, he poses, and tries to be macho. In the end he just tries very hard. He outperforms his character, surpassing him in all respects - Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, both on a higher level in terms of acting skill. Timothy Hutton (as always) was really good. There was an intermittent moment or two where his role was overestimated, but you could say he was enjoying it. He looked at the part and became personal physically and airily. Angelina Jolie was really good. She did not have much of a role; in fact, although she could have used a much stronger personality ... her character had not evolved enough, although she had done a great job with her. The chemistry between her and Houghton was obvious (Gee, perhaps that's why he left Auma ...); all in all, she was rough around the edges, but she was a strong bid by good actors and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not torn his role into parts, it would have been much better. 10/07.
