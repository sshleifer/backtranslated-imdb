This film was written in 1947 and was written and written by Orson Welles (in a non-traditional Irish accent) and also the brilliant Rita Hayworth with short blond hair less attractive. So, I was suspended with Orson by the Touch of Evil, Citizen Kane, the Third Man and so on, but this was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting has gone well, and she is doing a wonderful job playing the scary / fake Elsa, married to the lawyer of a crippled millionaire. Mike (Willis) and Elsa fall together. He wants to run away with her, and she does not know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his partner huddle and feed, just like the sharks Mike describes and attack each other and prove his prediction that he is quite real. Many transitions and turns follow the mystery of this murder as we reach a climax in the Fun House. (Think of the end of the shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, which has been heavily used in this scene). I was not sure who was the killer until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish is concentrated on the sea, which is delicate, acid and flammable, all of which have a great impact. These may not be the best fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. Add the delicious sauce to a natural pink shrimp filled with a healthy alternative, but fill an alternative to the most common regular food. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/lcoformovies
