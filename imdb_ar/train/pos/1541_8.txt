Just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and I enjoyed it completely. <br /> <br /> Great writing, excellent steering, excellent interaction, authentic staff, and a great comic timing. <br /> This film touches on themes of global family and separation. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American audiences all find the similarities between this film and their lives. <br /> <br /> If not all this is enough, this is probably the best underground movie history of the year ... someone distributes this in the USA, please! <br /> <br /> Finally, thanks Maria Fum! It's really a wonderful movie.
