Good, funny, direct and excellent story Nicole Kidman (I always love the movies you watch). This was a good "way" for someone witty in comedy and drama because there are elements of the two. A romantic comedy wrapped around crime stories, great final lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at a good romantic comedy, but unpopular ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Probably not very reasonable. Ebert has not published a review for this purpose. It is clear that the great "spiral" comedies were completely implausible ("raising the child", etc.). If you've seen an unreasonable comedy, have you seen it all? Or perhaps people are ready to move forward in the thirties. wondrous. Birthday Girl is a movie I've enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be the "killer application" for home video.
