The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man writes a film, or rather, * this film. It's a very subjective reference to the point where you think it will orbit around like a black hole. The writer writes something that happens, or something happens and writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life" but it's more oriented than Zen and for that, much better, in my opinion. At one point, you have personal interviews with people, then you see snapshots of these people being photographed, and you discover that their responses are written when one continues to close their lines. There are beautiful scenery and visual illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be played on DVD so I can watch it again more carefully. Watched at Cinequest (San Jose, CA) on 2/25/2002.
