Kurt Russell is Elvis, plain and simple. His dedication to this role resulted in what I think is the best living film ever. If you are a fan of Elvis, see if possible. <br /> <br /> The film was designed for television two years after Elvis died. <br /> <br /> One tip, there are two versions - one in 180 minutes and the other in 117 minutes. Only one to watch is the longest one. The shorter one has more than an hour of footage edited. It does not work because the scenes in it depend mostly on the scenes that were cut. <br /> <br /> From her childhood, Elvis takes you to his appearance as the biggest entertainment star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (the real father of Kurt) are excellent parents of Elvis. Pat Hingel delivers the highly respected Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> The king lives!
