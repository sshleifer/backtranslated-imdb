If anyone asks why no one makes films as he used to, with a conversation, a personality and a simple subject of friendship struggling to turn into something new and better and different, these people need to take in this film and watch first-class writings, It blends into a wonderful evening of observation about how things are in Italy and England. On other days, other times turned into a wonderful comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Blright, Paulie Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the main roles. Under the direction of Mike Newell's brush stroke, these performers perform memorable performances clearly filmed by the eye of the wonderful painter. Reminiscent of the farce of the stage bedroom at the turn of the century. This film may be called a farce of friendship that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of romantic nature within each character, and the viewer as well. A technical cable about the importance of caring for those around us.
