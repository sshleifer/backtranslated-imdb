I love this movie, but I can not get what is in this film. People who do not like this movie should be Richard Roper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carey is behind all this make-up. I'm sure most actors and actresses in the film have made a film before. There is a new face in the film. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lo from. With the opening, Grinch (Jim Carrey) emerges from hiding. The reasons for some fun for mania fun in Whoville. Sicne We know that who love Christmas. While Grinch does not like Christmas. And to make fun of Cindy Lo Ho (Taylor Momsen), the daughter of the city's postmaster, Bill Irwin. The film was directed by Ron Howard. The narrator is Anthony Hopkins. Muppets From Space is the mayor of whoville. Who does not like talking about Grinch near Christmas time.
