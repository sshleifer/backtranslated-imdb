This was not one of my favorites in Christie's work, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adjustment. The mouse motif was effective if slightly exceeded, the bones of the story exist despite the more focus on the sub-plot "Crime in the past." All the students were as good as I imagined them, although it was regrettable that they were not a more global bunch - maybe the revised 1930s did not allow it! I thought some bold risks had been taken with photography; perhaps because I had not read this book for a long time, but it seemed clear to me who the killer was from his appearance in some of the footage that revealed very early shots. The first poets. Sometimes this is a success, but I found a lot of it heavy in this episode (although I smiled in the line "the only lemon"). However, strong entry into the chain is not one of the best.
