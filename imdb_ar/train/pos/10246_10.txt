This film must be my favorite of all time. It's not supposed to have a conspiracy, because its makers want people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to think it was a real movie. It was an exercise in visual effects, and it never ceases when it happens like every other film. Movies are now turning around sound effects, making the appearance of visual images by computers easy in dealing with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because that was not the purpose of making the film. Have you seen the hills have 2 eyes? The rape scene was funny rather than shocking. Although I'm sure there are some pornographers from GONZO who tried to get married from the porn horror. But since they may be sucking into filmmaking, they may not be able to get it out. "Baise Moi" has an annoying rape scene, as the actresses are actually porn stars and show everything, although the film is generally absorbed. <br /> <br /> It is very bad to be able to produce a movie without thinking the money side of it all, especially when talking about the classification of AO or NC-17. I'm sure that Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his own movie series Hostel much better, but he has been trained to get an R rating ... or at least wish to suck his movies due to these restrictions. <br /> <br /> See the effects of death or more of the crushed gourd if you do not want to get real footage (scenes / shots of accidents / crimes). Do not forget that this film was produced in 1985. The fact that this film is still able to stand in front of most of the waste that has been produced these days says a lot about this film. It would be like saying someone sucking 8bit Super Mario Brothers because the PS3 has better graphics.
