Lizzie Borden Love Crimes is an important film that deals with the dark side of female sexuality (including full female nudity, which certainly outweighs the male type). It condones the sad shock and the prisoner who falls in love with the prisoner's theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of sexual desire is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden traveled beyond the feminist creed that women gained through their unsatisfied appetite. <br /> <br /> One of the striking scenes of a female fetish is revealed when the singer, the fake fashion photographer, seduces an older woman wearing a breeches by asking her to show how to ride the horse. He was cutting a crop to ride between her legs, squeezing the crotch, and this greatly increased her enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly she leaves her house and splits heavily at the closed door. <br /> <br /> Patrick Burgin plays the role of the artist, and though he is a long distance from handsome, he picks up the ordinary Jens and has a sufficient presence on the screen to make one think that a woman can swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young proves she is a stranger, and she is hardly beautiful. However, in this film, as a barrister in the region, his intense face, long slim body, distinctive hips and periodically disassembled movement turn into exciting charm. Its performance is strong and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an exciting view of the world and the fact that she is at odds with the spirit of the weak modern age that I really appreciate.
