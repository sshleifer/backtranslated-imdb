This is the only film I've seen in Prince, but it does not matter. I thought it was just wonderful singing the boy was wrong. Perhaps this is his best performance. The music is great. That's why she won the Academy Award in 1984 for the best music for a movie (or something like that). Now he has Oscar and Grammy under his belt. Although cursed gets in the way with the movie (just make sure the kids are young or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really get out and get this movie your group is not complete unless you get this movie. What can I say except maybe go and get this movie now!
