Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based on the book. The film has the same feeling as a comic book, and stays true to the color scheme. The Batman series had stepped up, fell, stepped up and fell again. Dick Tracy has a real survival force as something that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Good people triumph over evil, without blood and goron to clarify this point. Al Pacino does a great job of writing for Big Boy Caprice and Madonna unforgettable like Prithlis. But the best job at all is Warren Betty who embodies Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barroz. I can not wait until it is played on DVD on April 2, 2002, wearing a striped.
