Branagh and Fishburne offer excellent performances in this Shakespeare classic version. Branagh Iago plays better than I saw the character that was played in the movie or on the stage. Some may say that this film focuses heavily on Iago, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of the film, offers a strong performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Moor of Venice may be his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I face with this film is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Desdemona's personality is given much less depth than in the play. In this movie, it may not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Prang in this film was a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second season. This part of the play shows that Desimona may not be the innocent girl she portrayed as in this film. There was a number of subtraction that damaged the safety of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play, or watched a movie version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, broken or not, is still incredibly charming. Representation, as mentioned earlier, is very good. If some interesting scenes were added, and Desdemona was given a slightly higher priority, this would be a great film. As it is, still a wonderful version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
