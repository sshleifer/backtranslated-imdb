There are a few films that seem to provide entertainment plus realism. If you have ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern warfare, take a look at this. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene where hundreds of soldiers fired at the forest, and no one was sure exactly where that shot came from. <br /> <br /> They took on one scene to save Ryan's soldier, so they must have some advantages in the scene. <br /> <br />
