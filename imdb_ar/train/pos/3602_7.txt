While the story of a troubled child resorting to boxing for self-esteem and anger management is nothing new, the story is given a new touch here when the protagonist is a girl rather than a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has a problem at school. She just can not keep away from fighting. At home her father puts it down. Her brother practices boxing training at the gym and one day when she picks him up, she also decides she wants to train. <br /> <br /> I think it would be easy to label this movie "Rocky with the Girls". But this is not at all what this is about. In fact, the story benefits a lot from the main character being a girl and not a boy. This way you can handle more problems at once. First, the problem is not accepted because she is not a girl girl, then when she comes to the boxing gym she is a girl at all. It is also a story about how any purpose can change someone's life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want this to appear as evidence, because the film does not feel the claim at all, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good at the front. It is truly shameful that she has become stuck in the "hard writing" of the girl now, because this does not really mean her role in "Girlfight". She is certainly a female boxer, but she is the most sensitive moment that makes her really shine. <br /> <br /> So this is probably your moderately moderate story with a touch, but it is raised above the crowd by Rodriguez performing. I rate this 7/10.
