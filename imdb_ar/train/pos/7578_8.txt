Shintaro Katsuo, who played the role of the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, completes the Hanzo Trio with this excellent film in which he gets the ghost of love, the blind Beast. <br /> <br /> The big stick, often used in the pursuit of justice, has retired forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu himself was the usual brazen as he was pursuing those who steal from the treasury to lend huge sums to those who could not afford the costs. <br /> <br /> The usual sword and usual skill of the big man was present, along with blood. <br /> <br /> I will miss him.
