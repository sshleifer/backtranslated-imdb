Good work and interesting plot. After seeing the original I must say it was an exciting improvement and showed more film. Good actors .. Meaningful actors .. Although it would be good to see more expansions in motion scenes rather than background story. A fun movie to watch and keep you alert all the time 7/10 is a true vote I think!
