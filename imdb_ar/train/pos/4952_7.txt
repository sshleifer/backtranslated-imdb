It was screened on September 12, 2006, the second show at the Paramount 1 Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. World World was shown a day ago at the Elgin Theater VISA Theater. <br /> <br /> The basic plot includes Morgan Freeman, who played the role of a famous actor who was on the downward slope of his career and who plays the roles that may be underneath him, but he still does so with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent and so on. The falling slope is referred to by being a long time between roles with previous clicks in the deal DVD boxes and his driver by unsure of the same production assistant who drops Freeman in the community market where he will look for the role of a supermarket manager. It soon becomes apparent that the real-life market is being run by Paz Vega's iron-line exit writer. When Freeman never returns and needs Vega to help prepare for the interview, circumstances cause her to unite on a trip across the city to get Freeman home and get a Vega job that will make her on a more functional mobile route up. <br /> <br /> While the movie was fun, he felt that there was still a fee or work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (one Vega and Freeman teaching some of the other children's songs in the car, one playing literally like Paul Simon's music video) that looked like a charge to show time and until the film was about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's good to love Morgan Freeman well because without him this would have been very little. It was certainly fun in some parts, and Paz Vega was also pleased, but there was not enough to say it was a full movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started to stop the car. To seek guidance, Paz Vega said she had never done so. Who ever heard of a man wants to ask about trends and the woman says no !? In the real world, it is just the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you continue with the credits. The thing with the store's target store educating Morgan Freeman is how hilarious sales is just hilarious! Early on Freeman's driver insisted that Freeman's voice in reading "Books on the Ribbon" was very fun. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were present at Q & A after an investigation. Silberling answered one question by saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and that once Freeman took over, he did not change much from what was there. A complete compliment to the writings of Silberling and also about how Freeman could slip into a role and make him feel just as if he was born to play.
