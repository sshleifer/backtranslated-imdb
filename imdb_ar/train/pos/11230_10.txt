News agencies have talked about Hidden Frontier and have been reported for their long commitment to finding the best Star Trek stories and providing an example of the synergy that Gene Roddenberry had in mind. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is equal or exceeds those in the Trek series and other films. The value of production began to become smaller and increasingly volatile, but over the seven production seasons, representation improved, stories more complex, and visual graphics became smoother and more impressive. In season 6 episode 1, countermeasures, there is one of the largest space battles in the history of a trip. The ships are well presented and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real draw for the Frontier Front is not ships or backgrounds, but it lies in the interaction and growth of people. There are also gestures to Trek series and other films with places and personalities we all know. I recommend any fan to Trek to check the countermeasures and you will be connected!
