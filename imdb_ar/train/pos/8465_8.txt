Booth puts a completely new touch on your J-horror film model. This movie puts you in the position of hero of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist thinks and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the perception of people who work, live and love the protagonist, and how the people around him look at an old radio station DJ booth. The story tells the main character layers such as onions in their backs in the flash as the film progresses, and from it we learn that things are not always as they seem. The film was mostly in the studio of a small, outdated radio station with a very bad history, forcing the main character to broadcast his talk show because of the radio station on its way to re-locate it. From this narrow place, this movie thrives and makes you feel very panic and extreme paranoia. At a time when the protagonist was unable to identify the strange events in the old studio were caused by a ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or was all in his mind. What I like about this film is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make you paranoid as the protagonist did. This film is a 76-minute intelligent movie.
