"Holes" was a wonderful film. Disney made the right choice. Everyone I talked about said they loved him. Everyone was chosen for the part they did, and the Labeouf Shia really had a future in acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was quite imagining. Anyone who has not seen it recommended it and I guarantee you "dig it".
