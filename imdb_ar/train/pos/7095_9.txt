Terry Gilliam's amazing adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of amazing surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the wonderful cast. The Gilliam style works in the design of fantasy fantasies with the text written by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head just as he does with poor James Cole (Willis is more like Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, even!) Convicted travel from the future who does not literally know whether to come or go As a team of scientists continues to bring him back to the wrong ages while trying to prevent the plague of 1995 deadly to humans but harmless animals. Willis, Brad Pitt, an Oscar nominee, and Madeline Stowe as a good psychologist offer some of the best performances in their careers. Up to the degree of Paul Bockemaster-style tango chasing. This one does not miss!
