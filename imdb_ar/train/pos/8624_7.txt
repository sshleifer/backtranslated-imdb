What is the best way to start a review of a movie such as Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I came directly from watching this film, and the images are still burning in my mind - and I do not think it will move any time soon. <br /> <br /> It may be fair to say that if you are on this page you have a good idea of ​​this type of film even if you have not seen it. If not, let me warn you that this is not a moderate budget gem that has been lost for a few years "close to the dark", as it is not a low-budget, schlocky, "B" movie. What is low budget art, put in a simple but impressive way. The idea is a simple story consisting of seven stories revolving around, and ending, suicides involving images of a decomposed body. Sounds simple right, so boring? not like that. Words can not really describe how powerful this film is by the middle of the road; it really draws you to whether you're going or not. <br /> <br /> I can go here for a stroll around the pros and cons of the artistic trend; we may point out that the scenes were clearly filmed on Super 8 cameras and are sometimes shaky. I can explain that some of the sound effects are not synchronized in a way that competes with any Fulci movie, but it seems that all of this seems at the end unclear. <br /> <br /> As far as extreme films are approaching, I have seen the hardest of them, yet Der Todesking has moved me in a way that has managed a few others, although not particularly evil and has very few scenes that I would consider "unjustified." In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the latest story. I will not ruin it, just to say that the suffering of the emotional personality is actually dripping from the screen and making you sympathetic, if not eager to end. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's not the best movie ever created, and in many places it seems rude and maybe a little amateur, but despite these flaws, Der Todesking is an experience I recommend to anyone who likes to challenge cinema. If you're a person who likes to watch comfortable or "nice" movies, or simply want to say something senseless, that's not what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, you will not forget it in a hurry.
