As others have commented, I have reviewed this after Seskel and Ebert listed this as one of the top 10 films a year. What a gift. Then I went out to buy it, so I could lend it. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yuakum stopped his truck when he realized that someone (Cage) was at the head of his car. When Cage knocks, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakom pushes his gun in Cage's face with the words "Does this look like I'm afraid?" A great deal of humor after a dramatic (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> There was already a fun feeling in this. The continued vision of the "Welcome to Red Rock" brand raises a smile and a smiling head. The music created an exotic hunting quality for a movie reminiscent of the Peak Peaks. Unlike the Peak Peaks, though, it does not spoil things by going far outside and needing the same "top". <br /> <br /> I admit to seeing credits 15-20 times. As you can see, they played "thousands of miles from anywhere" in Yuakum (fully selected) and play a freight train bound to the desert land. . With snow-capped mountains in the distance. This was incredible, framed fluids. Moreover, I have never seen a better uniformity of sight and sound in the film. Also, it fits perfectly the story.
