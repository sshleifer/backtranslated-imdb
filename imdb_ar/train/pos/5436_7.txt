For years I thought that the comedy knockabout service was the product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaughlin as a potential customer. She certainly has the same coarse home humor that his films put with Ford. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I knew that it was George Stevens who had already directed it. I still refuse to believe that this film was not presented to John Ford, but it may have been in the Valley Valley Valley for the Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McAllen, along with Carrie Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr, play three Indian army sergeants who have an intimate friendship / friends / friends. But the old gang is disintegrating because Fairbanks is committed to marry Juan Fontaine. Not if his colleagues could help him, with the help and instigation of the magnificent brutality of Gwanga Dora as Sam Jaffe played. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem was a source of inspiration for this RKO film about barracks life in Raj. The sitcom is so good that it overshadows the incredibly racist message of the film. Not that the manufacturers were racist, but that was the British assumption there at that time, including our strands and Gunga Din shows it more effectively. <br /> <br /> The British took over India and made deals here and there with the local rulers under the weak Mongol emperor who was discarded in the middle of the 19th century. They ruled very little of India openly, and that was impossible. Their rule depends on the local forces you see here. Note that the soldiers can not rise above Corporal and that Gonga Din is much lower. <br /> <br /> Note here that the rebels are really Hindus and not Muslims. There are many strains of this religion such as the Christian denominations and this stifling worship was quite real. Of course for those who are suffocated, they may not have the same point of view as editors. But until India organized the independence movement, until the Congress party appeared, these people were the voice of free India. <br /> <br /> But anyway, you can divide it, and strangling people is not nice and the British have their point here as well. When I watch Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and why the main guidance came into being. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant has to play his role in the real game of Cockney here, instead of the Crian we used to see. Fairbanks and McLaughlin are well-suited to their characters. <br /> <br /> However, the roles of Cianelli is the best actor in the film as a teacher, the head of the cult of strangers. Note fire and passion in its performance, blowing everyone out of the screen when it is on. <br /> <br /> The favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli urging his troops into their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens works on the darkening of the background around Ciannelli gradually until everything that sees our eyes and teeth becomes like a mysterious Halloween mask. Nervous, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> More British audiences have begun questioning the basic assumptions that justify Raj after the events of this film in the late 19th century. But this is the theme of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gonga Deen is still a wonderful, fun and funny film. You must show up with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can sketch how India's independence movement developed.
