"Days" is a typical family drama with little attention - you should relate to your personal emotions in every possible way so you can really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [The possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show] <br /> <br /> The story, obviously, for everyone who saw the show, is Cooper's World, the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a genius. The first episode, which will look a bit stupid since John Scott Sheppard created this attitude - both sister and pregnant mother. This is the first position that the writer hits. The father then leaves his job in the law office. The younger son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets into a fight with a sister's friend. All this on a business day. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I like this offer. I do not know, I do not know. It's a bit crazy but I love it. At first I thought the camera work was just a rush, but then I got used to it and started admiring it. I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light. I loved the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget pattern. I like acting, I like the story and then I find myself wanting another season. He slowly became his fan when he finished broadcasting 6 episodes on ABC. It's a really good show and not like The OC. There is nothing in common between them. So I hope fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> If you can connect to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will love this offer. a lot.
