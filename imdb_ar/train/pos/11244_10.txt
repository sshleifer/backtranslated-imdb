One of my best films ever, perhaps because I was busy in the evil scene in the late 1970s and went to many Hazel concerts, but the film was a good story and a very good work by Azali and actor Phil Daniels is sure about his latest project Eastenders !! Excellent performance by many anonymous actors who if you keep your eyes squinted you'll see them in many UK soaps today: Carver out of Bill, the more you watch it the more you notice them, if you do not see you still have a night in the video, do not forget to Discover the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and fly your head in the style of Mochanian .... Enjoy
