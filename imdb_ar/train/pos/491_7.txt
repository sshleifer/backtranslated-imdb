Take 4 couples who have already had their relationships on the rocks and put them on the island of paradise where 26 will be lured solo. This was the introduction to the show, simple but frightening and funny. Leave it to Fox to throw the morals out of the window and allow the flow of immorality. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about this show is that it was not about people who were manipulating each other and dealing with them for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test of a relationship. <br /> <br /> People like the show or hate it. It was like a slowdown to look at a horrible traffic accident. You know you do not have to watch, but you can not help it. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
