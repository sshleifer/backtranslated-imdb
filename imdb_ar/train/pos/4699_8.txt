This is an act of crime that he did "not another teenager's film" of the school. I laughed all the way while two incompetent gangs fought with each other and between them. An indifferent comedy that uses jokes and public mages that made me trade all the way. I suppose the biggest gap in the entire film was that it never seemed to move forward, leaving the besieged characters in their thirties.
