Good story and excellent animation. The effect of Frazetta and Bakshi is clear, and this is a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Barbarian Conan or the game of fortified turrets and dragons must enjoy them. The battle between good and evil is quite clear although our hero is sometimes neutral. Elves are often depicted in fantasy films as white skin, blond hair, sprites and sprites with dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with the work of Frazetta, Bakshi, or even Tolkien knows that they are not racists. Anyone who enjoys fantasy movies should love this movie. It is not for young children because of violence and sexual orientation. The casting process was well done and the sights and music were first class. I hope someone puts this jewel on a DVD soon. I consider myself lucky to get a VHS copy in good condition.
