The French brothers of Naudet did something that no one else did, and they had a video camera on the day of the tragedy. They were in Building No. 2, when I saw papers pouring down on the ground, and people hit the ground from jumping from that height. <br /> <br /> I mean it's going to the extreme when both buildings collapsed, and the camera was still on, when it was covered with white dust, they found a shop entrance and got inside, but all these footage are real and I think they did a great job To pick us up. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary film I watch every 11 September, so I will never forget what the country has been through. I think that if I remember the truth, it signifies the first death of the firefighter's chaplain, while he was being transferred to the church and his funeral was gracious.
