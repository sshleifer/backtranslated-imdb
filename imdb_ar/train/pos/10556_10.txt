I was not sure what to expect but I'm glad I went to see this. A little twisted crooked comedy makes you think. I was not sure how the director could create "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natalie and the illustrious individuals at C.O.R. To create another low budget group looks real (it can not be anything real). Well worth your time and owner, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You'll be glad you did.
