This is an incredible return from the mastermind of the film's director, Tsui Harc. It is one of the few films that deserve to be a face-to-face match with Shaolin's football of Steven Zhao. From the moment the film started, there were amazing backgrounds on every edge that were full of style. If you are a Chinese sci-fi or martial arts geek, you will love the excessive amounts of many of the three-dimensional effects and realistic weapons produced by your computer. There, a good performance (as always) comes from Ekin Cheung, who plays Sky King. He cooperates with Louis Kuo (Red), who has been greatly influenced by his flexible "wing" that has turned away from future attacks. The combat movements of these actors were in every way. Not only is the work wonderful but has a somewhat complex story. Many critics in this film complain that there is no story / theme or just "pushing them into random parts of the crash" and even calling them "feces legend". However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this film. The others who are famarialy with the films "Wu Xia" will have the best. With due respect. There can be twice as much to be expected. The blow to the enemy in the recent battlefield can be more fundamental and devastating. In spite of all this, we must see it.
