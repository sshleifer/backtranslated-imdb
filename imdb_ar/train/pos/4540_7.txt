The film starred Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a policeman from Tokyo sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype from a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit in the hope of selling him to an upcoming car company run by a man named Derek Jared. Unfortunately for him men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. Derrick Jared tries to distance himself from Philip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of them and threatens to force him to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, in the same unimportant yard where the Japanese man was killed, a friend of Tony Costas was killed by the same men. Tony's friend was watching the patio unimportant. <br /> <br /> Tony began to find the killer against his boss's request. Tony is being robbed while obviously killing must investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he committed in the Japanese policeman and was arrested by mistake. In the end, they end up working together on the issue. They make a strange pair, and there are some really entertaining parts, as well as some funny scenes like Pat Morita jump and kick right through the windshield of a moving car and kick Madras in the head. But it ends up being a cop cop friend, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not a representative, but he is loved in this role and Pat Morita is also good. However, they are making one of my friend's most duet two possible officers in Action. If you love my friend's cop films, or Cheesy 80 movies, or you'd like to see Jay Leno as an actor, I recommend this movie.
