Midnight cowboys are not for everyone. It's rough, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. Key actors John Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will continue to be Oscar-winning actors, are making spectacular performances. Voices like a Texas swindler, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small city of Texas to New York City to become an impostor. He does not apologize for his chosen career, but it is not so easy. New York City women are different, such as the rich lady who played the role of George Johnson and Cass, played by Texas Women's Oscar nominee Sylvia Miles. Unfortunately, Buck tries to escape from his previous life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, who played actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 for cancer. The sites in New York City are wonderful to watch, as the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck characters evolves into a male man into male friendship. Men struggle to survive in New York City by not sticking to rules like getting a real job. As the film developed, Buck's back appeared on the surface, painful but not clear. The film is not for children but compared to movies and television shows today, Midnight Cowboy may be more hospitable. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party she does not forget. He's also a tear player for a movie, so get out more barns.
