The low-budget digital video has strengths in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best in terms of quantity so far. In low-light conditions, the distinctive video tone prevails, but surprisingly, it competes with film stocks for brightness, clarity and saturation in bright-colored situations. This is a film that is made at the grassroots level at its best through a sudden dialogue that carries a kind of "Midnight Cowboy" story about the killers' work on everything needed to survive in San Francisco urban.
