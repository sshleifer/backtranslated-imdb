I love this movie! The animation is great (for a Pokemon movie), the cgi sounds very cool. I love the music in the film. They kept great Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: it's fantastic. He has a great sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pok√©mon. Ash is really awesome in this film, and I love his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like was the appearance of Suicune, it suddenly appeared, and Ash & Co helps a little bit and leaves. They could have made his role in the film a little bigger. <br /> <br /> But the movie is great in general! Can not wait to own the USA version on DVD!
