Jim Carrey shines in this beautiful film. This is now one of my favorite movies. I've read everything about the manufacturing process and thought it was unbelievable how he did it. I can not wait until this comes out on the DVD. I've seen this in theaters many times, and I can not even count how many times I've seen it.
