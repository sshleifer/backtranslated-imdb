Marjorie, a young woman working in a museum and living with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night she enters her car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. This plan is her rape, but she managed to escape the man who has his bag. The police can not help her, because the actual rape did not happen. One day, when Marjorie's colleagues are at work, her attacker comes there. His name is Joe. A long battle begins against this man, but then he was able to spray his eyes and mouth with the insect repellent, which would kill him if he did not get help soon. It connects him and makes an atmosphere of the same kind of physical and mental assaults used earlier. The Extremities (1986) directed by Robert M. Young.It is based on a controversial play outside Broadway of 1982 by William Mastrosimon. Farra Fawcett, who has sadly lost her battle with cancer last year, is as wonderful as Marjorie James Russo, who also played the role of the striker in the play, disguised as Joe. Alvary Woodard and Na na Scarwid are as wonderful as Pat and Terry.James Avery is seen as a Security Guard. He won the Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie supposed to enjoy you. He asks a question for revenge. This is not an ideal film, but I recommend it.
