The sad thing is that programs such as Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are real-life television, not just a game of glorification. I think that the land inflation of discontent has existed over the last few years through the premature cancellation of many offers with followers of the community. But with the loudest response to Jericho fans (which I also enjoy) and other shows, networks may start to reverse this trend. Like others, I will not support any new offers until they are awarded the second season. After that, I may make a decision to watch and catch up on DVDs and online presentation. Until then ABC, I lost as a viewer for any new show.
