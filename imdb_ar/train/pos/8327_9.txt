This was a fantastic romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no daughters or sisters as he did elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great manufacturer. He has brought together two nice people, played by two of the best acting actors. The support team (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Jane Sachs, Stephen Frey, etc.) has clicked on the screen and made this a great viewing experience. It seems that the fact that his driving car to get around contradicted all those pictures and posters that he was riding a bicycle for. And he was wearing socks in one scene ... It is said that the professor never wore the socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb Goofs section.) Along with historical inaccuracies and contradictions, this was a great film to watch with great actors. Give it 8!
