Mr. Michael Jackson is a technical phenomenon. His short films, any music videos, are simply the best. I do not care if I get the rationalistic advantage of the sci-fi of this guy, but I'm interested in getting a variety of crazy dances, screaming screams, wonderful audience choreography, and some parts of CGI and animation. There should also be some uninterrupted videos. Everything you mentioned here. The stupid plot and the Top Vanity Show are no problem when I watch Michael Jackson play. For me, he will always be the final king of music videos (not the "king of pop" which seems to be submerged, especially for us, Russians, because "pop" looks like the Russian word for "donkeys" and MJ certainly not "king of the calendar"). I can re-watch the best music videos (which are technically beautiful) and never tire of them. <br /> <br /> The first impression of this film was "What's this ...?" (Clips from different videos, some pictures drawn, unsteady jumps from one feature to another, no cohesive plots, some kids cheating on them, etc.) But as I watched it to the end, I could say it was wonderful and really Nothing like anything else appears on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows anything shameful and can easily be seen by children. <br /> <br /> Without Mr. Michael Jackson, the world of music videos will be pretty bad. Even the best classic videos of other artists can not be too close to the active exuberance of the MJ music savvy and artistic quality. He knew how to get an audience of different ages and knew how to remain a man with ethical principles. <br /> <br /> When I see a correct version of a DVD with Michael Michael videos, I know it's worth buying, even if some clips already appeared in some previous versions. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are all fantastic, although "Moonwalker" is just like a single film (with the theme "Smooth Criminal" solid, the theme "paparazzi" and a few parody and strange developments) . <br /> <br /> Since I'm not a fan of MJ, I can still give this "movie ... like any other movie" 9 out of 10 (I've been beaten by "Smooth Criminal" certainly and I complain the main is what The following may have been dropped: "The MJ Master Drug Campaign" was supposed to give more "madness and missile stress" and there was supposed to be more "walking on the moon" of course. Thanks for attention.
