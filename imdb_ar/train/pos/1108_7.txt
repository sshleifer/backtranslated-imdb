Some of the familiar "Altman masterpieces" seem sad to me now. Maybe it is me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "less" Altman (which recently appeared on the FMC channel), although I do not think it was aimed at a wide audience. FAO's policy as a "mini-image" of public campaigns. Some of these sarcastic "documentary dramas" are now dated, such as Dick Cavett, who watches the Tonight Show show, but I found a lot of funny and insightful dialogue (eg "You're real, that means you're not a threat to anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I loved it. And funny shows, especially Cavett (as "himself"), and Lauren Bacall as the personal head of the elderly conservatives, Glenda Jackson (who is already a member of parliament) as a leftist intellectual (in the opening scene giving a lecture to someone wearing a carrot on the sanctity of politics) As a basket case. All in a unique Altman style, although it may not be as unusual as usual. But beautiful incomparable.
