It was adopted at birth and I certainly did not have any problems encountered by Anton Fischer in the film, but I still share some feelings and this film really helped in getting them out and being forced to deal with them. It made me realize that I had a "missing piece" and I would look for my future now. <br /> <br /> I cried for about a day after I saw this first time. The face of Antoine with his mother blended by the reaction of his father's family to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find religion for us. His self-confidence and affirmation of his mother and of the abusers of his past were very strong. "Yes, my parents put me aside when I was born, but another group of parents picked me up and loved me, and now I'm successful!" <br /> <br /> My wife also helped to understand me and our adoptive children, who experienced tragic experiences before they reached our home. This helped me to realize how lost our social system was. If you remember reading the story last year about a baby incubator in Florida who "lost" then the story of "Miranda & Ashley" in Oregon City where SCF ignored multiple sexual assault complaints about the man who eventually killed them and this week's film was released, In New Jersey three children were ignored by the system. One died. It seems that the state thought that the house they were in was fine because the guardian was working (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems that have been raised in this film - and they are well dealt with through the script and by the representation that Antwone Fisher should be a "best picture" candidate for sure. Regardless of whether you have adopted it or not, it is a heart game that can not be ignored by anyone interested in children in our society.
