After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided to enjoy Blackadder with a third appearance. This time instead of the times of the Theodore or the Elizabethan era, Edmond Blackader (nominated by Baffetta Rowan Atkinson) lives at the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is stupid but now beloved is the "personal servant" of George, the Prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the beautifully written sitcom, Blackadder tries to do its best to become rich and powerful. Tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a man on the highway, and finally represents the prince. This is a very good premium for popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltran, Tim McInerney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was ranked 18th on the Top 50 British list, ranked 24th in Comedians, eighth in Britain's favorite comedian, and Edmund Blakder was third in the top 100 television personalities, Comedy characters in the world, and Blackadder (all four series) ranked second in the best comedy series in Britain. Excellence!
