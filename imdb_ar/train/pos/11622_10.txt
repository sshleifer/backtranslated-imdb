Celian Murphy and Rachel Mac Adams star in this action / thriller written and directed by Mr. Thriller, Wes Craven, himself. The entire film begins with some problems in The Lux Atlantic, a Miami hotel. The whole problem was fixed by Lisa Recreat, the hotel manager. Then you go to the airport, where all problems start. You meet Jackson Ribbner, who does not like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Reaper, if you know him and I mean. After that, they boarded the plane, and they were sure that Ribbner and Reiser were sitting next to each other. During the next half hour, Lisa was intimidated, tormented and terrified by Ribbner. I will not give anything away. Then we move to where Jack Lisa is chasing at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is fine, and crazy enough, Rippner already exists. There are nearly twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout this whole scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense work comes in the end. <br /> <br /> The film was not only intense, it was a big conspiracy. As I said, I will not give up anything because it is shocking, very exciting and somewhat disturbing / scary. The representation of each character in the film, even those with no lines at all, was all perfect. It was incredible. Everything was awesome in this movie! Representation, music, effects, make-up, output, editing, writing, everything was great! Wes Craven is definitely the master of suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must, and it is definitely worth spending your money on it. You can watch this movie again and again and it will never become boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye I have to say it is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some severe sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> MPAA ratings: PG-13: Some violent and language sequences <br /> <br /> My Canadian Classification: 14A: Violence, scary scenes, annoying content
