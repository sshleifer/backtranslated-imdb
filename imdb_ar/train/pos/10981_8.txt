Hi Now, Your TheaterX really, I found this during the review of videos in the second-hand goods market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box, this was a "successful blow" to some extent, so of course I came home with me. <br /> <br /> What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this 28-room decaying house on Long Island (Suffolk Ku) and shares the house with raccoons, cats and fleas (the eye!) And who knows what. Suffolk once outdid them to live in filth, and Jackie came to put things right. However, this is one strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wears something on her head and dances and sings, and gives a tiny aspect to the camera which rarely makes much sense. Big Edie (79-year-old mother) seems to love running jerk, and while we get hints about what may seem to be fortunate, it was done with a taste (?) To the extent that we avoided the mercy of God. These women speak, speak and speak, most of them about the past, meaningless, except for them. They live in absolute filth, and cats do their work anywhere ("Look, this cat goes to the bathroom behind my picture!"), And one bedroom seems to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to the voice of Big Edie, it reminds me a lot of my late aunt, who was from that area of ​​the country and was the tone of Lawn Guyland. One scene has Little Eddie puts flea repellent, lovely, you can see all cats scratching all the time so the place must have spread. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I would say in this case that it is just a verbal expression of "getting rid of their gourd," but this film is not without moments when you really feel something with them. These parts are equally creepy, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching as soon as I started. This is not an ordinary flick type, but I found it pretty cool. It will not be for everyone, guaranteed.
