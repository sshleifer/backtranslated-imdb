It was a life change, it was really !!! The Man In The Moon is a wonderful breathtaking experience. The acting was fantastic, the story line was fantastic, and this was a perfect start to the life of Reese Witherspoon. See how no one liked this movie. Sure, it's not the best film at all, although it was close to him, but he was very fun to watch, and she laughed hard at one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs. Of course, there were some of your heart screaming moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and shines your day, although you should get a little depressed from the story every now and then. I do not think this film has won at least one award, and I can not believe it has been seen by a few people on this site. Watch this movie if you do not want to.
