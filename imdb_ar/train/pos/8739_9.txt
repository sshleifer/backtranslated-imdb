This is a funny film. It contains all the usual Disney components (music, a wide range of characters, story, appeal), linked to the great animation and vocal talent of lesser-known actors such as those who say "Antz" and "Price of Egypt". <br /> <br /> The characters work really well, have a strong attraction, and the humor is aimed at a wide level that overcomes the generational barriers. The film is also presented in a superb cinematic format, adding to the film experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've watched the movie three times, and I plan to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics saw this film based on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work with multiple transmissions, and I can honestly say that no one ever came out of this movie without feeling complacent. <br /> <br /> Watch it, and it is not delayed because it is animated. You will definitely enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay at the end of credits! At the end of the day, clowns and outdoor meals are the most part of the film, full of laughter all the time.
