Watch this film at the Vancouver Film Festival and think it was deadly, stylish and funny. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. A wonderful work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast's top and well-being. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I found myself thinking about the film for several days after watching it. <br /> <br /> The book, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomayak and Andrew Curie have written many layers of the political text - but they did not turn you upside down. <br /> <br /> The world they created has a depth, and it makes sense. There is an edible spirit of folly in this film. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to treat anger. <br /> <br /> I loved it !!!
