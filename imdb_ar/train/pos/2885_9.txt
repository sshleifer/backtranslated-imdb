When it comes to fairy tales, it was Cinderella that made you cry more than others. Poor Cinderella is a girl who has been robbed all her life by two ugly slut sisters and her mother the slave wife. Thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we got to Cinderella in the animation. <br /> <br /> Before the story begins, Cinderella, her father, Haidan, and Tharyn have outstripped their needs. To share his fortune and give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father marries a woman, but then dies soon after. Father's wife, just see the dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous daughter, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> So for days, Cinderella is a slave to her mother and her stepmother. She has hope, but thanks to her friends, the house mice (it seems that Cinderella did not play a full game). She hopes to find her prince one day. The opportunity finally comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a friend. <br /> <br /> 9/10
