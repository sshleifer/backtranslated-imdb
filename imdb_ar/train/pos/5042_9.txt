A summary of this film does a great job explaining what to expect. It's a very exciting film. Well shot. It's hard to believe that it was the debut of Bill Paxton in the directing, although some of the footage looks exactly like the release of the work board. <br /> <br /> However, there are some really good looks that show some real fantasy by Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful story with some wonderful transformations in the end, many of them, all believable, fun, and best of all, well obscured enough to make them real transformations. <br /> <br /> The actors in the movie also do a great job. I'm usually worried about movies with children in the roles of the tournament because they often perform when Nickelodeon refuses, but both work well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good. It's not too scary. But it is very creepy too.
