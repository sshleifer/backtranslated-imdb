I really like this film because in Australia, Chinese films like this are not shown at peak times. I must say that this is one of the most serious movies ever, which sets the difference between Hong Kong and Chinese people. It really shows that there is annoyance between the two, but it can only improve when Hong Kong learns Mandarin. He also explained to me how Indie rock scene is in mainland China, and that the Chinese people know how to play guitar and get home fun! Who said China is not ready for rock? Daniel Wu is very cool, with his clean and fragile voice, sincere representation, and a full chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asian peoples to cleanse themselves of Western stereotypes, people who like Chinese / Asian cinema like me. check it out!
