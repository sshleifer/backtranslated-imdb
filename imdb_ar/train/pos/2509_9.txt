Vampires, sexy men and guns and some blood. Who can ask for more? Moon Baby delivers everything in one click packaged well! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who kisses the Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows with time but with Sho progress, immortal Kei immortalizes his heart. They do not help each other to love the same woman. The special effects are very good given the small budget. It is a moving story that beats with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry more. Even if you are not a fan of their music, watch this movie. Works great as an independent Vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
