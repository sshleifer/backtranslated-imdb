The 1960s is a wonderful film (I saw it all in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 1960s. Although the title suggests otherwise, the first five years of the sixties are not really important in this film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist on the road in the United States against the Vietnam War. There meets his girlfriend, Brian, Sarah's brother, Michael, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He came back from the war and changed the movie "Tom Cruise Born on July 4th". In the Hippy.His dad is a kind of pro-Vietnam war (what a surprise !!), the carriers of the sister Michael Kit are two of the rock & roll artist and run away from home and go to San Francisco during the summer of love. The end is very bad (the father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I let this escape my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> Performance of the actors is very good and the soundtrack of the film is very impressive. All the major events of the 1960s are present in the film, such as the murders of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King as big protests on Hippie, Summer of Love and Woodstock! Look closely for the wavy "Woodstock Speaker" broth (what goes on in our mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid staff at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 1960s is a beautiful film about a beautiful decade! 10/10
