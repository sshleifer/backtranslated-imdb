First, I would like to point out that the people who criticized this film made some blatant mistakes. Obviously anything that has a rating of less than 6/10 is absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is a very cool movie with amazing movie effects. Actors are very believable, thrilling narrative thought, horror and very disturbing content. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this film. Many questions arise when the audience is exposed to the strange and strange creature that makes the habitat in the mice dark tunnels. How was Craig created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie with great cooling factor. The film contains many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated with others like 28 days later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Look forward to more of these great movies !!
