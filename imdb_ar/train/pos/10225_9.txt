I laughed a lot at reading all the stupid comments of this film, <br /> <br /> because it is obvious that those people who criticized the film never saw him, or were stupid enough to pay for his vision. <br /> <br /> The best reason for watching was at the Elvira show a few years ago. Elvira made the film as laughable as possible. <br /> <br /> It's the brutal flick, compared to the hundreds of horrible American clicks that have been produced. Way better !!!!
