Each time, Eddie Murphy will be surprised. <br /> <br /> In a film like "Golden Child", in particular. This is a film that you would like to portray maybe Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, gentle, courteous, frugal, clean and everything else the hero has to be. <br /> <br /> After being selected to secure a Sophie child holding the key to protecting the world from evil (embodied by dance), Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back, while beautiful Kiyang (Lewis) wonders if he is all he says It is an old crazy holy man (Wong, perfect as always) it is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting and impressive in locations, amazing, and of course funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know who can start a movie by making slippery remarks behind someone reading a pornographic magazine and ending with smart remarks about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "kid": it's a "golden" discovery. <br /> <br /> Nine Stars.
