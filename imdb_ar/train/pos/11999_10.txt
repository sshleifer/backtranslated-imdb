I've seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure her name. I went to BYU with her and lost her contact with her first name was Kim Luke - I wonder if anyone has information about her. It's not included in credits. This production was wonderful, a tear player on all accounts, acting admirably by everyone. I think I do not even want to put it in the general category "acting", more like "shooting with the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this final dispensation" ..... that. If anyone works with Kim or has a website or anything, please let us know !!! She was wonderful in her role, by the way .... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
