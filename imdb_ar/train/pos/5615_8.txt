Kafkisk film of alienation and madness of greatness. Well done well and Polanski's performance well at first sight desired to try hard to adapt to his intimate residence in Paris and his fellow residents. Horrifying early because of his fellow middle-center tenants and especially obsessed with terrifying fears later developing his defenses that would eventually be a retreat. Personally I could have done without a dressing element, but I agree with Psycho's nod and the fact that she has some logic, taking into account the story story. However, it was possible to work without him and removed the element of the play a little, but then perhaps it was meant that the courtyard seems to take the form of theater in the end. I can only feel that there are more than a few of the director's feelings of being a real Frenchman and a Jew. However, there is a lot to enjoy here, including the impressive performance of Isabelle Adjani with the wonderful appearance and the good old Shelley Winters that are as reliable as ever.
