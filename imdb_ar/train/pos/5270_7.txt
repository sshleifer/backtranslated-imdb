This movie is probably really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad behavior and bad direction reinforce the movie hysteria. Twins are very funny in their roles Conanesque. If you go to this movie expect the first Conan or Excalibur, you will hate it. If you watch it in a good mood and accept it as a good and enjoyable pleasure you will have a fun time. Watch the scene where they try to hang the brothers, the most extreme scene in the film. I wish that the 3000 Mystery Science Theater would do this !!
