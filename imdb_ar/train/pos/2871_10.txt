Suspension? Like my comment is necessary? We are talking about every time masterpiece, for all seasons and all generations. This is the only kind of film that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies is a kind of magic. All characters are somehow "alive" and "real", so it is easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language. (Like I did not understand when I first saw it, because I'm about six years old). Maybe my English is not good, but I've learned what I know mostly from this kind of film, and that's the other big dimension to this kind of movies, which is rare nowadays. But there is a great shame. In my country it's now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright, so our children are handicapped to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies. So, will we watch this movie again "Dream Once" or ...?
