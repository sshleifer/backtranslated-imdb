Bellocio refers to this as a political film mainly, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but this seems more metaphor than reality. Well, almost everything in the movie seems like a metaphor. The revolutionaries, whom we see and who learn very little from them, may also be the Mafia. Out with the old and with the new. <br /> <br /> Andas Papa, a psychoanalyst, appears to defend the traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally upright, unbalanced, clean and tidy, comprehensive rituals. <br /> <br /> Julia, a revolutionary friend, seems to be what could happen to a person who desperately needs support but is unable to mobilize the kind of dedication that such commitment requires. (I think here). It seems that Andrea, the teenage boy, is the only man in the film who does not care "in a quiet way." He respects his father but also disobedient. He likes Julia, or so we assume, although he is not really old enough to learn how to best manage his reactions, but leaves her to show up at school and complete his final exams. His way between these contradictory lifestyles can be described as "the media". He is the man who separates them, who knows the meaning of gradation, who can keep his calm while yelling around him. <br /> <br /> Much of this is summed up in the oral part of the World Cup when asked to translate and comment on Antigone, which runs counter to the traditional authority of the gods with secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> This leads us - not by certain particular I am aware - to Marushka Detmars. She has been thinking of a New Yorker cartoon a few years ago. The hippopotamus is at the depth of the neck in the river, staring at the gazelles drinking from the bank, and the hippo says to the other, "I hate her." She is a good actress. (Allow me to bring him out of this way). But this is the case for everyone in the film. She carries with her, in her words and style, a rich glamor with frank madness. All this comes from the actress too, and not from the steering assistance. Detmars are not nuts the way that Catherine Deeve nuts in the "package". Do not turn walls into rubber and grow hands. Instead, we see it moving - sometimes animated. They give us horrifying shocks when their mood suddenly changes and they threaten the way they are threatened by a thunderstorm looming. <br /> <br /> Described as being ugly, it was probably not the word he was looking for. She is pretty attractive with her soft brown hair, a wide white smile ready for her, her driving laugh. Her eyes are like eyes in paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The erotic parts are very exciting, not because one of them is obvious, but because we know the characters involved. (It's interesting to spy on my husband's honeymoon neighbors instead of going to the flick.) In fact, there is not much sex. There is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets him play at a time that seems to be real-time. In real time at least for an eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is very good, which is necessary, because the film almost entirely depends on Julia. They must do and do. If it is not for their performance, I'm not sure that this will be as interesting or as impressive a flick as it is. Can easily turn into a somewhat slow romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Worth it.
