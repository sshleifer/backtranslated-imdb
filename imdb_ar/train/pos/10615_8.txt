Strange is a style similar to Hollywood's most ancient secrets of horror show. The movie is fairly slow but a lot of alien images keep it alive and watching it. The basic idea of ​​young girls who are being tracked down in the basement is an old idea, but good acting and production make the film worth watching. The film is characterized by its emotional impact and certainly not for any obvious action or special effects. I rated 8 out of 10.
