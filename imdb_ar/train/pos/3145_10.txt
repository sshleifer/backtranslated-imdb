That 70s Show is the best TV show ever. He is there with Andy Griffin Shaw, Lilly Saturday Live, and Simpson in my book. This 1970s show continued for eight seasons, all focusing on a group of teenagers who deal with relationships, separate from their parents, and their overall future. <br /> <br /> The main character, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live next to each other. They have been living next to each other for most of their lives, and they only begin to feel more passionate for each other at the beginning of the first season. Much of the presentation revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> There are two other people, Red and Kitty, who are Eric's parents. Reed was in service, so he really paid Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Although she drank heavily, she treated Erik and his friends very carefully. It is clear that Bob, their neighbor, is Donna's father. Bob laughs with many women around the coarse story of the show. Bob also harasses Red to the limit. <br /> <br /> The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez, and Jackie, are Eric's friends. It also plays a key role in the story of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is awesome. This is when the characters started feeling new things to each other. The first season is original, funny and fun. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although it is not as good as the first one. It is a fundamental continuation of the former. Eric and Donna together, and everything works wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Season 3 is my favorite. She returned and captured the sense of the first season and humor. I also think that the character chemistry improved a handful, making the presentation more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not close to this level. Eric and Donna Arnie are not together in this, making the show less fun a bit. It's still funny, although I did not enjoy it as much as I did in previous seasons. <br /> <br /> Season 5 is the last season you enjoyed all the time. It's the first year of the gang, so it really helps in the story. The fifth season was the best in all seasons. <br /> <br /> Season 6 is good for the most part. It is very funny, although it does not reflect the feeling that other seasons have done. The gang is out of high school, so I think it did not hurt the teenagers feeling that the previous seasons were the same. I also did not like the last three or four episodes, considering that they felt great respect for them. <br /> <br /> Season VII captures the same feeling as the fifth season, although he did not do it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season as I enjoyed all the others, and the end was great. <br /> <br /> The last season of last season was filled. Eric was not there, what he destroyed. Kelso was not there too, which did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, ending with the appropriate series. <br /> <br /> In general, if you enjoy comedy, try showing this 70's program. They stopped making new loops, but it was still on the TV bunch. I also recommend buying chapters 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy the eighth season.
