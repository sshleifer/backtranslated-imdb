This is short and to this point. Writing the story used in Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Representation throughout the map, but it seems that the main characters over the years have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not reformulate what has already been said about the collections and drawings. Given that this is a totally volunteer, without any profit, it is wonderful. <br /> <br /> If this is classified as professional production, I will have to give it 5 good stories but awesome sets. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give it an excellent rating, as with the exception of a few other efforts, it is in its own association. For the big size, I do not think this has been matched. Congratulations to the actors and staff on the effort impressed by many.
