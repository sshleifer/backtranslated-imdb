Robert Stack, rich and alcoholic, falls in love with Minister Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is happy to stop drinking. However, Bakal is secretly loved by the best friend of Stacks, Rock Hudson. And her sister Stomax, Dorothy Malone, lust after the rock. Get rid of some complications and the film gets out of hand (in a good way). <br /> <br /> A highly polished film in beautiful Technicolor with fashion and furnishings falling on the jaw (see Bacall Hotel's room at first). Everyone seems perfect and dresses are beautiful clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with grade production values. The story itself is a lot of fun and some of the dialogue at first is hilarious on top. The representation by Hudson, Stack and Bacal is not good, but seeing them young and charming is great ... especially Stack ... when my knee smiled weakly! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is great - she has won the best supporting actress for her role. It's exciting, violent, sinister and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny garbage. do not miss!
