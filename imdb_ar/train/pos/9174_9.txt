There were many film and television productions for Jane Eyre, each of which I had to recommend, but I think this is the product that people will still discover and will love for decades. It's just a classic story (and much more than the others). Timothy Dalton in his element just like Rochester, rarely lacks the mark; his performance is astoundingly graceful and many colors, while not departing from the dark complexities of personality. Jane Zelah Clarke's Jane is more brainy than others, but she makes the ideal Dylton (which suits her towers appropriately!). The nuances of her performance are better met in a second show (once she absorbs the shock of Dalton charisma). There are some technical flaws and a few moments where production values ​​can be better; although this was pretty much a great production according to BBC standards at the time. But, the presentations are a real pleasure. Do not miss this one!
