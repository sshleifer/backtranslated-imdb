I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia and was pleasantly surprised. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it funny was that it was based on a true story - hilarious! They have some great personal actors in it too. Mindy Stirling is very good. Loved it at Austin Powers. Howard Hessman is also awesome. I remember him from the head of the chapter. I'm fed up with all the dark movies that are still obscure. This is fun and light, and I can see it with my family and not feel embarrassed. Keep checking to see when it will appear on your DVD. I will definitely buy it.
