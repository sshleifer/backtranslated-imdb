The program is still crazy compared to Spinal Tap because both are comedy about R & D groups. In fact, here the resemblance ends because the book "Still Crazy" is written and better represented, while the Spinal Tap script is deteriorating from the first 10 amusingly amusing minutes to a driving group that makes Bevis and Boothide appear sophisticated in comparison. Crazy is still crazy, but the resemblance of characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some of my music numbers have succeeded in offsetting the predictability of the film. People who expect a Spinal Tap-like experience will be disappointed by the lukewarm nature of the film, but I was trying to make a still naive film with a slender but failed satire, Spinal Tap.
