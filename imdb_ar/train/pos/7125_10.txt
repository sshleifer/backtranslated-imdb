Mr. Tom was filmed very beautifully and realized beautifully. He is not completely loyal to the book, but should it be? No, not at all. John Zoo is a charming Tom Oakley. His transformation from clumsy to care was well realized, making him more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Christmas. After Inspector Morse, this is the best hour in thawing. He was seriously interviewed by young Nick Robinson, who gave a very convincing picture of one of the people who had been evacuated from the trauma because of the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and music made them worth buying, and you'll also see a melting ice-playing machine. amazing! The most exciting scene, however, is the knowledge of Willie by the death of Zach, and then Tom told him about his deceased family that died of Scarlatina. Buy this, you will love it! Bethany Cox
