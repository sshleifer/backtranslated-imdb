I am a huge fan of Jane Austen in addition to being a long film (a real fan wants to see as little as possible and can only achieve that in a mini series) was really fantastic. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the rich and energetic girl, and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightley thanks to his balance and nobility. I was not pleased with Ewan McGregor, although I liked him a lot as an actor but I did not feel he had spoiled the film at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen, there were things I wanted to see, which did not exist, but that would have made them longer than a long film, and I felt they had packaged the story well. I have seen every adaptation of this book and I felt it was the best!
