Movie message, but a fairly good idea. Cast hanging, from top to bottom. It is interesting in the plot of this House of Davis plot to go back to the foundation! The very negative reviews (a cast name on the script / playwright, which in one way or another are associated with very negative comments about "Angles in America", etc.) object to the fact that the film strongly preaches Germany in World War II. Oh Ghosh, this is just a very sophisticated understanding of ethics for me. <br /> <br /> The play and the film industry are different, the acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later, this film will not be produced from here. Yes, Casablanca is a better film (I think), but although it was produced the same year and they have the Nazis, Casablanca is basically a love story. The story of love in this film takes the second seat in the spy plot - more than a thriller. Both have a fairly large number of fairly cheesy accents and fantastic personality actors. Children are a bit boring and can be edited
