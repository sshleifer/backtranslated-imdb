In the early to mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write Howard Hughes's final autobiography, claiming he spent months preparing for the book, and participated in interviews with the isolated millionaire. When all this turned out to be untrue, Irving was falsely accused and spent several years behind bars (although he always acknowledged that his findings were accurate). Flash Forward Until 20001, a few months before September 11, a book entitled "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States as "Loss of Honor: Love and Death in Modern Times in Jordan") by a previously unknown author Norma Khoury, A woman from Jordan, who reported on the death of Dalia, her best friend because of her mercy, because of the fact that Dalia, who belongs to a religious Islamic background, belongs to a Christian man. So, like the biography of Irving on Hughes has been revealed as a potential trick. Anna Bruinowski, the Australian film director, is trying to get into the quagmire of Khoury's attempts to purge herself of lies. During the 104-minute time frame, the film tries to reveal Norma Khoury, who tells the truth, or is it just a mandatory lie, with her own agenda? Interview with someone he knows / knows (including her ex-husband, publisher, etc.) tells their side of the story. This is a well-produced documentary, and can guide many fingers to many potential culprits. Uncategorized, but it contains a pervasive bad language and re-representation of the horrific scene of murder, which has been played several times (but almost nothing like drawing and disturbing just as one can see in the latest epic of pornographic torture, like Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for young people.
