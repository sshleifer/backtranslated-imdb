Although I am very young, the Beatles are my favorite team too! I never had the opportunity to hear their music because it was published, but I loved them because I remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that's worth trying. I can see why it was not released in the cinema, but it's definitely a wonderful movie being shown on television. I was streaming through my TV guide and I happened to see this film, and he did not have much detail except for something like "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the disintegration of the Beatles, Jared Harris Stars." I did not hear of him (playing John) or Iden Quinn, who played Paul. However, the representatives certainly understand less than their appreciation! <br /> <br /> It looked like a slow start, but as I developed it, I could see how well Quinn was playing, but especially Harris. As a great fan, I know a bit like Lennon and McCartney real. The script was fantastic and Harris got on Lennon's tone, personality and behavior! Queen played the role of McCartney well, but sometimes he entered into his Irish accent. Make-up artists make them look great. <br /> <br /> This paragraph may be counted as A * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, it started a slow start but quickly developed and became quite an emotional film. I found some thing in the park a waste of time and free of character for both musicians. As for the lunon line in the Italian restaurant, it is completely unnecessary. The end was very moving and it would break my eyes whenever I saw them. <br /> <br /> It's quite different from the other biographies I've seen about how the Beatles meet each other, and those that did not really do well. For example "Backbeat". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say, if you are a Beatles fan, John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give it a chance you might be pleasantly surprised. In just about 95 minutes, it is worth waiting until the film develops. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows whether the 1976 meeting has actually happened, please send it to the "Comments page" for this movie, they will be very interested.
