Deppardieu's most famous film is the leading film (1974) by Bertrand Beller. She is characterized by many intense sex scenes that are about to be rated X, including one by Jean Moreau making a hot copy of her 1970's and C trois with the French hippies Depardieu and Deware. There is no such thing as the Holy Land in this film; everything is a fair game. <br /> <br /> It's strange that Americans do not like this movie very much, while many of the French I met see it as a classic. Something goes against what was programmed to "impress" the Americans. <br /> <br /> Gerrard and the late singer Patrick Deward are two violent thugs and a lot of sexual insanity, wandering around harassing women and committing minor crimes. They are fighting for kicks, anti-capitalist "freedom", "Euro evaders", "freedom". Shaking the creak of hell from these two men, while at the same time making the bourgeois society itself seem more absurd in the end. The best of all is the way in which Stephan Graveli's brilliant degree conveys the relentless spirit of hikers or deeper unconscious consciousness or "ideal" that stimulates all the folly in which they engage.
