HG Wells is undoubtedly the most influential writer of the 20th century. Jules Verne claims to be the father of science fiction, but his stories were more adventure stories using brilliant inventions as plot tools. Wells was deep and brought a subtext to his tales. Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there is no evidence that people believe in life on other planets before the 20th century, where many people, including Richard Dawkins, consider it almost certain. There is no evidence of this, of course, and one can only wonder that it was Wales that gave this to human thinking? No doubt it was Wales that planted the seed. <br /> <br /> Things that will come from Wales are adapted from his own novel. But it is clear that he is unable to tell the difference between the technical aspects of writing novels and writing the script. The speech is often loaded, heavy-handed and unconvincing. For example, pilots from opposing sides discuss the nature of the war: "Why should we kill each other? Why?" This reflects the criticism, close to the naked contempt of Orwell of Wales in his article "Wells, Hitler and The World State" and it is true that Wales' anti-war message is exaggerated. It would be impossible to believe a conversation between a Royal Air Force pilot and his counterpart in Luftwaffe a few years later. <br /> <br /> It was said that it was very nice to watch a 1935 film predicting a world war in 1940 to herald the end Civilization. There is a striking and exciting picture of infants when a child beats a cylinder while an imaginary army walks in the background and the society collapses and the fear of Wonderland disease is realized admirably. Even the fairly slow storytelling to show the year of preparation has a convincing character, it is the images that make this film along with the mark of Arthur Bliss that makes the film unforgettable. To be fair, Wales raises the question "the universe or nothing, what is it?" In short, this film facilitates its flaws
