I swear when I first saw this movie, I cried! STAR IS BORN is a movie that lets you know what love really is despite the obstacles John Norman (Chris Christoferson) and Esther (Streisand). You can also experience something like losing love like this at the end of the movie. Streisand and Christoferson enjoy such wonderful chemistry together and wonderful music! When you sing Streisand with another look you / watch closely now, it's just pure magic! Making this Evergreen song movie one of my favorite, Queen Bee is a fun song. I also like the fashion of the 1970s (except for African-style Straitsand, in addition, it's beautiful). Born Star is my favorite film first. This film is a pleasure to watch and is finally broken.
