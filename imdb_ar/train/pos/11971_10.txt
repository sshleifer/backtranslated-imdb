I think the comments regarding the cheesy offer are a little overpriced. When someone comes to watch a TV show, what is he looking for? It's to enjoy watching an offer, unless it's a critic or someone who analyzes the story. But most of us are not and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal place to watch after a heavy day at the office / school. It makes you laugh and not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family and a virtual family. If any of these families exist in the real world, that would be a role model for us. But this is a television program, not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with portraying a virtual family on television. The fact that the show can go on for a long time shows us that people enjoyed watching it, no matter what the comments were later on. <br /> <br /> Another good point in this show is that anyone of any age will not only enjoy watching it, but will retrieve a message no matter how childish that message is. Jesse's talks with Michelle are very moving, if one does not consider her childish. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say after watching every show for Full House, there is a conviction in your heart that is rarely present after many other programs.
