I saw the description of the film on TCM and I did not work it because I love Peter Austenov and Maggie Smith, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that I really liked the film and found it very exceptional. Of course, it is seriously dated, but as a time-piece worth seeing only for the gentle humor of insight into life and lifestyle for nearly forty years. Now the only problem is trying to find it on a DVD so I can watch it more than once. I was also impressed by the performance of Smith and Austenov as leaders, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the outstanding appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
