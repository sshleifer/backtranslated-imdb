I just watched this on the classic Turner movies last night, for the first time ever, and I love it. I like a lot of old movies, especially because of the absence of all dirty languages, excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think that it has been improved in many cases (not all). Jimmy Stewart is my favorite. I thought this film was very enjoyable to watch, and I enjoyed it completely. If you feel the same way about old movies, I do not think you can make a mistake in this film. I think "I've got a mail" is a remake (although a little different and a very enjoyable movie.) For this movie. To spend a comfortable evening with a movie, you should not be ashamed if your children or anyone is participating in your show or get it or scan it on a classic movie channel.
