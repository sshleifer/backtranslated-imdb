Well, the main reason I watched this movie was that it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park. But as soon as the film began, laughter began to break out of my stomach. From hidden gestures towards humor, to the stark humor of the toilet all the time, along with the constant reliance on some very ambiguous errors. This film can spoil the most brutal event on the face of poker, not to mention his underwear in poker. Some of the most flamboyant people will blow away jokes that were filmed by Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of themselves thrown into the bargain. <br /> <br /> I just showed that not only is Tracy Parker adept at writing that he is not too shabby in the game of acting too old. I was surprised by how much I absorbed in this film. However, I am very concerned about the lack of it to buy online, here in the UK. Sort the boys! <br /> <br /> I will continue to introduce it to all my friends in an annoying way to refer to funny bits, and sometimes snoring to beer. All in all Excellent movie if you love unnecessary comics. But if you do not have any sense of humor about silly things or rude guidance is obvious! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Blythe may make you ignore these biases.
