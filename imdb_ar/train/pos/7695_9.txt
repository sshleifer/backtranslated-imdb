Good Times was a leading comedy about the first black nuclear family to live on Chicago projects. Whether you live in inner cities, Jewish neighborhoods, suburbs or rural areas, this show is still a treasure to watch and watch the family as a family and not a show about a poor black family. But they do not talk about it. They find humor and have family values ​​and strong morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping in the air but I did not want to kill the father I agreed with Esther Roll who struggled to keep the family together. But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved the JJ dynamite and his exotic. We watched Benny Janet Jackson grow up a bit. This exhibition was a pioneer to show desperation in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being preaching, Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
