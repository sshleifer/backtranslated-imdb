<br /> <br /> I am having trouble with other reviewers' comments for the simple reason that this film is opaque, not miraculous! It is not the only film that has a seemingly supernatural interpretation ("vampires"), but it seems to be a very cool movie. <br /> <br /> The other films that come to mind are "Edgar Wallace" that comes to mind "and (more famous)" Mark of a Vampire. "<br /> <br /> The film does a great job in Create a "very nervous atmosphere", such as DRACULA, when Reynfeld meets Count on his castle staircase, or in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two look through the windows of the ruins of the castle and see a "body" playing a member while slipping a luna using the wings! <br /> <br /> If one likes these air touches (often silent), this movie must be! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
