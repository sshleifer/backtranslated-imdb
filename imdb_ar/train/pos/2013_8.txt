In Frank Sinatra's first three films, he was purely professional: apparently playing himself, he only appeared to get a song in the sequence of a nightclub in someone else's film. In his fourth film, "The High and the High," he is moving into acting by playing an actual role ... the task becomes easier because he plays himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to beat a few. <br /> <br /> Sinatra's entrance is very funny. Michelle Morgan hears a knock on the door and asks who is there. From the outside, a toned voice of Hopokin responds to Frank Sinatra. Certainly ... <br /> <br /> The opening credits of "High and High" may confuse some viewers, with the names of the songwriters Rodgers and Hart prominently displayed. In fact, they only contributed to only one song: "disgusting Rich", which enables this actor to pose as a kind of introduction to a completely different song, "I'm Beginner". Interestingly, the song Rodgers & Hart - one of the weakest songs - may be the least fun song in the result of this film; there are many other people who enjoy a large numbers of rhythm, especially "it is a more important issue," and "when it comes to Love, You Are Alone "and" I Saw You First ". <br /> <br /> Sinatra was good in this film, but he would do a better job (and sing better stuff) somewhere else. The real benefits of "high and high" are the nice turns of some artists who rarely make films. Paul and Grace Hartman were a very famous dance team between the husband and wife who starred in many Broadway productions: real dance dances, putting a lot of physical comedy in their dance material. (Here, Grace shoots a high shoe from Paul's hands). Grace Hartman, who died of cancer at the age of 48 years, did not succeed in any film work, so it is my real pleasure that this film gives us a rare opportunity to see closely, to hear her beautiful singing voice and notice how sexy she looks like a maid. After the death of Grace Hartman, her husband had a long career as a representative of the characters, and he sometimes danced solo. (Or with Ken Perry in an unforgettable Mayberry RFD episode). <br /> <br /> The young teen singer Marcy McGuire is also very attractive as a maid here in 'Higher and Higher'. Why does this talented girl not make more films? She might have been a bit like Betty Hutton. I enjoy Hutton's performance, but I love Marcy McGeeer more. Near the end of the "higher and higher", there is little of the amazing physical work that characterizes McGuire and Mary Wickes as candlesticks, taking alternating shifts from table to table in a nightclub. Alternate steps for McGuire Short and the long gawky Wickes are fun! Unfortunately, although Leon Errol plays a big role in "High and High", he hardly ever performs any comedy work: he has never performed a famous dance with rubber. Jack Halley has been wasted, despite his outstanding bills. <br /> <br /> He was very well represented here, Dooley Wilson, who was remembered as a Sam from "Casablanca". In this film, Wilson performed his own singing but faked his keyboard performance "over time". (In real life, Wilson could not play the piano.) Here at "High and High", he sings fun and gives some amusing reactions to other players. Less fun is the Odious Mile, I mean the Torme Mile. Victor Borg offers a rare film show, dealing with his dialogue skillfully, but he did not do any of the keyboard comedy he later performed successfully in his theatrical performances. <br /> <br /> The plot? forget that. "Top and Top" is not an idea for anyone about "great" music, but it is an enjoyable joy, and I will set it up out of 10. Director Tim Whelan, who has worked in Britain as well as in Hollywood, deserves to be very well known.
