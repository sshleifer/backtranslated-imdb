Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work in Sharpe's popular magazine, hoping to live the life of his dreams but struggling to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on staying in American business, this comedy drama has received mixed views of criticism. Described as an unlovely funny way but charmed by actors, it seemed that how friends lost a run from the fish mill outside the pool ridiculed another cultural comedy, but that was not the case. The image works at the expense of its representatives and the story is simple and sharp. We started in the past, then at the present and work our way forward to see how Young made his mark in one of the best American magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is very fond of words. Whether it's hitting the zombie with a cricket bat or showing the owner the nature of the law, the English actor brings magic and lightness to each scene. Here, when scripting is good but far from its own standards, it brings a great deal of energy to the image and is only worth seeing. His instincts with "Babe 3" are unforgettable; they are simply breath-taking things, as is the case with his extravagant dance, but he pulls them off beautifully. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson make a good performance in portraying stereotypical magazine leaders where Dunst fits nicely with the benefit of confused love. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, remembers everyone who can act here with a funny hilarity for a typical movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Miles starred in the image of Mother Teresa is as laughable as her exotic characters in the swimming pool. To emphasize that there is a dog, Pegg is touring a real British-style comedy, with a wonderful little twist. <br /> <br /> Although there is a British film, there is an adaptation to the American way of life for young people as they try to fit in and we can see different approaches to telling the story. Young wants to fall down the right and contrast with American professionalism. The inclusion of tabloid stars in modern times will make this film soon dated but the concept of exploiting movie stars gives this edge. <br /> <br /> The first image of Weide is not perfect. There are gaps in focus where the plot becomes very soapy with a clear and embarrassing development, and there are many unnecessary characters. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a side note, clones on DVD are among the best programs you've ever seen, about half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama Simon Beige is again shining and with the group group approach to storytelling and sharp comedy, it is worth watching.
