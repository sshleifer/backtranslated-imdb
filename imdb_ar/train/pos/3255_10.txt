Each scene was put together perfectly. This film had a great crew of staff. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, you do not have and will still exist at all. He has the ability to lighten any film with its stunning talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting alone on a shelf of films in the "Blockbuster", and as he was calling me, I could not resist picking him up and bringing him home with me. You can call me a naive romantic, but this film did not touch my heart, let alone laughed at me at the same time. Although that made me cry, I admit, in the end, that the entire film had lit my view of life afterwards. I have proposed to the horror film, the movement, and the pure humor of his brother who adores this film perfectly. This is a good-looking movie. It can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love, and enjoy your life. Every time you walk this movie purposefully, you just have to realize that you consciously make the choice to live and feel this inspiring film. Who knows? What if that could really happen to you? , And make your mind open to the wonders of Sufi life.
