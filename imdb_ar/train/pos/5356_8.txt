Running Man is not a great movie, it's really ridiculous. But it provides what you want in Arnie's film and this is action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone can enjoy this picture, it's very silly and on top, making them laugh at themselves. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's most quoted films out there.
