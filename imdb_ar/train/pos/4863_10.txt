Going back when the musical performances were not designed for the choreographers, we had great films like this one. <br /> <br /> Since we like both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to see this film finally. Not quite a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American humor of the vaudeville, a slapstick, not a clever joke, collides with British humor in Woodhouse. But on the whole, the American-style joke makes American characters look real rather than cartoon. <br /> <br /> Some of the creative exercises for dance figures, including the magnificent fairgrounds with rotating floors and entertainment mirrors, are even more than made for the lack of Busby Berkley on top of the dance figure. They seem much more realistic, if you can imagine that people start to sing and dance as realists. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the film, instead, allowing the dynamics of different characters to deviate. It is also good not to have an interest in reckless and loving love. Instead, we have a great interest in extreme love, more in line with young female aristocrats in Wodehouses.
