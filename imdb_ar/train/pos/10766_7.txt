A thin story with many beautiful shots. Eyecatchers Here are the three ladies of D.R.E.A.M. the team. To a lesser extent, the man accompanying them. Tracy Lords acts convincingly with half the female evil business partner who intends to poison the world with antioxidants. The origin in this film is the Vest bomb, which was placed on a member who was captured in the team D.R.E.A.M. Of course they are saved by one of the participating members, three seconds before the explosion. Despite the obvious lending of James Bond "Goldfinger" and "You Only Live Twice", this peak is always working well. All in all a beautiful hour, James Bond was replaced here by three Angels of Charlie.
