This film may seem dated today, but remember it was produced in 1974 - by Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin skipped just Hippie Deby and Yotherman, and turned into an ironic humor. This film is the grandfather of all of them. Enjoy it because of its historical importance, as well as its strong entertainment value.
