In 1996, "101 Marks", Carrillo de Ville was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police (PBUH) for attempting to steal and kill 101 puppies - the Dalmans. All covered with mud and straw, spent the next four years in the "can." Now, after 4 years, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say, it's about 28 years - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So, in 2000, Disney decided to issue a supplement to the successful live version of the classic movie, which is called "102 Marks". In that, there is a 102 dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think; I should know this because this has just been shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! Also, while Cruella (played again by Glenn Close) succeeded again, she wanted to get a bigger and better coat - made from puppies again !!!!! <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the song - I'm sure everybody loves the song "The Atomic Dog" since the 1970s or so. Now, we hear a bit of it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is a wonderful movie I keep wondering - when will there be "101 Dalmians?" ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 Stars
