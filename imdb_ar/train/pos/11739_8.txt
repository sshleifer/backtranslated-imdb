"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a type of "Harper Valley P.T.A." With supernatural touches. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) begins her work as hostess of a horror TV movie after the owner of the new station returns to work with her. Now rely on the Las Vegas show to carry them, but they know they need to get more money to start the show. It seems hopeless to collect these funds until she receives notice of the death of her aunt, who takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read the Will. The house that needs repairs, a dog and a cookbook is all that her aunt left her, and once again Elvira seems to be having trouble getting money for a Las Vegas show. Adults in the small, narrow-minded town make things worse by making things harder for Elvira. Only a large local piece (Daniel Green) and a group of teenagers will endorse it. Elvira's "Finney" (W. Morgan Sheppard) presses a deal with Elvira for a cookbook, but Elvira soon learns her strong heritage that includes spice and two vats. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined that his hands are aware of his power. Elvira then faces burning at stake because of the old town's charge of magic, and the confrontation between her and her uncle. The plot is very simple, but humor and sophisticated characters make it move at a nice pace. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of cute, beautiful, brilliant and intelligent humor performed by many gags, pimps, props, songs, and parodies. The mysterious touches make this one of the most terrifying parodies ever. It's a well-made film with a wonderful rendition by all the artists; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease.") There are also nice special effects. Many people (including me) wondered whether Elvira could carry a feature film, and the answer was yes, yes!
