When Hark tries to solve his experiences, no one can resist him. Legend of Zou is probably 6 hours intense at 1h40. One does not understand everything, but as in the "2001 Space Odyssey", you do not need it either, but one feels the power of the film every second, every picture. An extraordinary vision of the future of the seventh and most innovative art in the world in recent years. VERY STRONG MASTERPIECE! It is just as perfect. <br /> <br /> When Harek tests, no one can resist him. Legend of Zou is probably 6 hours intense at 1h40.
