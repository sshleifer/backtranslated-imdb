The vision of "Moonstruck" after many years is a reminder of how this beautiful and funny film appeared when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who Heard About Olympia Duckies? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, Vincent Gardinia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comic talent, and Norman Geoson was not the director. <br /> <br /> The only real note in this wonderful work is "When The Moon Hits Your Eyes Like A Great Pizza Pie, That Amore," a song sung many times in the film (once too much) and lasted for a long time in Folk music. <br /> <br /> Shir - Aslamni - is as exciting as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and should not be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johnny Cammareri) is committed to proposing and displaying her pinky ring as an alternative to the engagement ring, and then rushed to Sicily to be with his deceased mother. Loretta is accused of seeing his strange brother, Rooney, attending the wedding. Loretta confronts Rooney and soon falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardinia) cheats on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), who was accidentally discovered by Loretta when Rooney invited her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything works in the end, as it is inevitable. In films of this kind. In the meantime, all actors themselves contribute impressively and enjoy the audience themselves. In "Moonstruck", Hollywood was at its best: fun entertainment with no social significance at all. If they only lost this Amur all along, it would be perfect.
