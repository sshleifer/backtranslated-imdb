The part of The Grinch made for Jim Carrey and I am very impressed with his performance. I was not very impressed with him. I was scared but I was surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen in the role of Cindy Lo who was the nice little girl I had seen on screen for a long time and showed her maturity after years of acting in acting skills. I was attracted to cry at one point! I did not read Dr. Sus's book of the story so I did not know what to expect, humor was completely dark. In general, I enjoyed the movie (apart from the songs!) And recommended it, to see the family in particular.
