While the premise of the film is very lame (being diagnosed with a "hornophobia"), the film is a nice little click and fun. It is also a little better than the films they continued to produce after this film - perhaps because this is Halle and Hardy's latest Hal Hal and Hardy production. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see any of their recent films, because the whole chemistry is lost in these films and the boys are playing their roles fully in the lament - something that the real Laurel and Hardy films will never do. They had some edge that all the subsequent films lacked. <br /> <br /> Stan and I work in a trumpet factory. This sounds very funny, but it is not. Not surprisingly with each racquet, it is about to be a nervous breakdown and it should take some time to work. The doctor (James Finlison - in his last film with the team) recommends a trip to the ocean. However, they do not like sailing and have the idea of ​​renting a boat tied to docking - and then they can get all the sea air they want without bothering! Once they are on the boat, a dangerous criminal commits a flight from the boat and all of them accidentally go out into the sea. Fortunately, this part of the film was actually well developed and the end was good. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a great long film for Laurel and Hardy, it has been much better than many of them since it did not have disturbing and scattered music numbers (as in the Devil's Book or Children in Thailand). In addition, there is still a fair amount of physical comedy - something you will not see after almost this movie. Part of this was due to the deterioration of the health of the boys (and the growing "oyle" meal), partly due to the total ambiguity of these subsequent films.
