I do not agree with the other comments posted on this film. For example, the film depends on the book, and if the writer has a gay personality in it, how can the "Hollywood" throw a gay character in the movie. Besides, there were two gay people and I thought they reflected each other wonderfully. One was normal and the other more feminine but not on top. Diane Keaton performed wonderfully, and if other reviewers were respected to see the entire film, they saw that her character evolved during the film by interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sarah crashed in the yard, you can see her mother's side come out, and later in the film, she also saw invincible. But I think if you are too worried about gay characters and defective characters, this movie is bad. But if I'm more open and I do not really know some clarification of what's good, you'll enjoy this movie.
