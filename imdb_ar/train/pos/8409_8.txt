Good movie, and one I will see it several times. Rich (former commentator) is right: there is a lot more going on here than is evident from the title plates, and I must wonder how much he suffered in translation. Was there more in the original? Or was the audience expected to read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based - was this a currently popular story that the public was already familiar with? In short, it is worth watching, but it probably requires more work by contemporary viewers than the original audience of 1913 to put it in. <br /> <br /> Alpha Video displays the new result for members, but the music does not match the story of progress in any way. It certainly starts promising, but it turns into a monotonous replica of Philip-Glass that does not reflect anything on the screen. After listening for a while, I stopped the sound and just watched it: much better!
