This cartoon is short in the plot, but it is visually stunning work. There will be some very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short story contains a "story" that incredibly light sculptures are responsible for returning the spring each year, yet you must face the winter that was not ready yet to be pulled. All the statues and the storm have their own songs. This is a plot to a large extent, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot but about color and animation. Exceptional photos. In 1936, this bright color was still something new, and there are some incredibly inspiring works here. <br /> <br /> My favorite short moments surround the movement of colors flowing through the tubes. At more than one point, a series of pipes aligns in a row, from shorter to longer, moving colors through the tubes and showing the musical track as if the row were a member of the tube. <br /> <br /> The images of the battle between the emerging green spaces and the winter storm that refuses to leave quietly are being carried out very well. These types of short films were things pointed out by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Essing, but they also probably helped the final exit from MGM, because this cartoon may have exceeded the budget and MGM finally decided they could better control costs if the animation department was managed from Before someone a little more aware of the cost of Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is a really nice cartoon and worth watching. It is available on the DVD of Attack of '30s Characters. Recommended, especially if you love good animation.
