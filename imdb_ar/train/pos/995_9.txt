This film surprised me. Some of the things were "vulgar" and some technological elements reminded me of "The State Enemy" starring Will Smith. But for the most part, a very good and enjoyable mix with Jamie Fox and comedian Mike Ebs and two gullible thugs Julio and Ramondo (which provides some comic comfort). This is a movie you can watch again ... some Wednesday night when there is nothing else. I gave him 9 for entertainment value.
