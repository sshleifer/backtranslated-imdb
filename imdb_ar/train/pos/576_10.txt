Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now he is the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish island as me, so I loved it The fact that there was a real link to this film, and the ingenious notes throughout the film were wonderful, was just fantastic, so much so that I bought the movie once it was released for retail and I recommend it to everyone to watch it, the fly fishing was amazing and really cried in the end it was very sad, Know what they're saying if you're crying Well, it must be good, and this was certainly our congratulations also for the little boys who played Norman and Paul, they were just wonderful, and the kids are often left out of the list of praise I think, because the stars they all play are big in size, but these The children are amazing and must be praised for what they did, do not you think? The entire story was very beautiful because it was real and someone's life was after all that was shared with us all.
