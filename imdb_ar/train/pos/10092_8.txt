Elizabeth Taylor starred in this unknown classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with the owner of a tea farm from British Ceylon (current Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she immediately feels out of place and forced to adapt to the new culture as well as to the constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. William Dieter, who directed The Life of Emile Zola and Portrait of Jennie, does a brilliant job of bringing in a somewhat dark, almost strange love story, and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen with blacks, a white palace under the title and a gorgeous island scene.
