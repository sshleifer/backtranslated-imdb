This is a great movie that's fun from start to finish and will always be on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. In my opinion, the critics of this film are very much underestimated. <br /> <br /> My progeny fits well with the well-studied mountaineer Gaby Walker. Along with him Michael Rucker makes a wonderful appearance as Hull Tucker. Then, John Lithgow, one of the best shows I've ever seen of him is evil. <br /> <br /> The fact that 75% of the movie is done in a mountain has a large group of villains on it that makes way for a lot of work! <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie!
