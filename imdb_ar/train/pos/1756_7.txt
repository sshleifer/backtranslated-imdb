A 40-year-old virgin made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed a lot of jokes and scenes in this movie. Steve Carell is as perfect as Andy Stitzer, the nerd of his virginity, and I think the scene in which Andy's hair was removed by wax is one of her finest, especially because it's true. Many actors and actresses present in this film are known or already known, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It's a bit weird and brings a lot of games together, but it seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends in his work, they discovered that Andy is actually ... a virgin! It is already 40 years! After this sudden revelation, all his friends try to make Andy sleep with a woman ... The problem is Andy's confusion, especially now that Tric, a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in his store, was beginning to like him.
