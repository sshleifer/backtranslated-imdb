I really liked this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, representative, wonderful story, directing / working camera / music. It is a gift to show it to someone you love. Too bad Jaco van dormael did not make any more movies after this movie. Top 5 work. Oh really !! <br /> <br /> Today, after 3 years and 3 days, then comment above. It was not published because it was not more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is undoubtedly the highest film I have 3. With "Cinema Paradiso" is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I'm curious about the new "jaco von dormael". I hope that my film will be completed at the top 3. If you see this movie, I will hire it. Or even better. Buy it. Because you'll want to see him again.
