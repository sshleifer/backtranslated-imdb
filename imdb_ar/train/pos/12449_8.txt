Finally, a good film was released from Modesty Blaise, which tells not only a story, but actually narrates the "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect a thriller movie, but if you stopped in your track and I dropped all your expectations. You will then notice that it is a story very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to figure out how to become a wonderful personal wit. It is not a film to attract new fans, but a film that tells the real story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the terrible movie of 66, this is a wonderful movie. Are you a fan and then sit down and relax and just enjoy that the real story exists with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story.
