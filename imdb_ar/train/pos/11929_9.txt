One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family movie is one of the works. <br /> <br /> At that time, in 1994, this film was the record for the biggest movie show in the history of motion pictures (and may continue to catch). Held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film "Angels" who "hunt" Pirates of Pittsburgh. In this new version, "chasing" the angels of California. <br /> <br /> However, the first show at Three Rivers Stadium, which has long been home to Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at the time, was presented at PNC Park and Steelers in Heinz Field. The premiere was shown on a five-story movie screen inside the stadium and carried (and probably will continue to be) the record for the largest film show in history, which was screened to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all present to impress thousands of sports enthusiasts.
