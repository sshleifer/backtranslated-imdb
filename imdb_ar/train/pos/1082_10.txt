Mr. Blandings Builds may be the best dream house Frank Kapra / Preston Sturgis never made! If you love "Raising the Child," "The Philadelphia Story," "The Tall Man," you are a male war bride or a wonderful life - movies made of intelligence, taste and casual tongue placed gently in the cheek, check this one out. The post-World War II life is simply and ideally portrayed. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the top of his image as he plays the mouse in the city and risks life in the country's squares. Louis is adorable as a wife before now. Compare the characters in the characters "You can not take it with you" and be included earlier by Tarzan Lakes Parker in the future. The direction of art and editing is much higher than the level. <br /> <br /> The movie never starts from the hoax of low-rent, tricky columns for the subsequent adjustment of The Money Pit.
