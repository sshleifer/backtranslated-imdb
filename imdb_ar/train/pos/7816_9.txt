Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with Oscar-winning Gandhi in 1983. I did not know of any other work until I recently encountered Cry Freedom, which was released again in 1987. While it may not be as popular as Gandhi, It controls everything, if not more, and was released when South Africa did not get rid of apartheid. While most films dealing with social issues appear after the event, I think this film was released during that time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), a journalist who used to work in South Africa until the late 1970s. Traces the origin of friendship with Woods with the attractive black leader Steve Pico, portrayed by Denzel Washington beautifully. I can not imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes natural magic and the presence of the screen, which is required by the personality of Pico. <br /> <br /> While initially Woods was against what he felt was black racism spread by Pico, after interviewing the man, he could not help to get caught up in his struggles and ideas. Their relationship is growing stronger, and Woods and his family are becoming more sensitive to the plight of people represented by Pico. <br /> <br /> However, finally, the tragic blows must focus, and Woods must now focus on escaping from South Africa, with his book, so that he can publish them and inform the outside world of what is going on. The second half of the film is a story sweeping his escape from South Africa, with his family, and will keep you on the edge of the Orcs. <br /> <br /> There are some delicious comic dialogues as well. An example is Pico and the lawyer in the courtroom. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you support violence? Pico: I defend the face. ATTORNEY: Well, is not that violence, Mr. Pico? Pico: Not necessarily. You and I now face a confrontation, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that prevailed in the country before a better feeling prevails. The scene where the army opens fire on a protest by schoolchildren is the sad and tragic gut. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must. I would suggest those who are not familiar with the work of Attenborough, do they take too long for this purpose. There are movies that make a lot of money. There are films that make lives. I prefer on any last day.
