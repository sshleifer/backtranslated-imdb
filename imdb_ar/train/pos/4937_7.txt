This film is actually relevant today, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threats of the supernatural bugs, the West Nile virus and SARS. As an excitement, the tension is fairly intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than they serve in their roles. The local scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interval for the master planner. The actor in this film who left his mark is Jack Ballens. His clearly defined features and outward seemingly simple withering are always a means of detecting the hideous and cruel man under the surface. The chase scene through the packaging factory is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
