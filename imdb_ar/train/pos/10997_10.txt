Wonderful. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen - <br /> <br /> I loved it perfectly! Before finishing the opening credits, the screen was glued. <br /> <br /> It's a science fiction story - and the edge of the Whodunnit seat. unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I hope it never ends. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is an important player. Anyone can play it. The main actor, Jeremy Norththrum was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This movie, which I love for war games, appeals to me, sneakers, and tracking. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
