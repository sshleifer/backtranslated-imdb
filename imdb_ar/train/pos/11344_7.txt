Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in cinema at the age of four and I have wonderful memories and full of vitality. Looking at this as an adult allows one to notice the references on the target audience - such as the one in which Jimmy Witch's charming wig split, while Witch Hazel (Cass) "I KNEW has brown roots!" Of course, it is strongly influenced by flora culture at that time, and in some respects very progressive. The different track, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers about being yourself, not working with the package, and proud of what is different from yourself. This can be a hymn to the gay community, it must be a wonderful track. <br /> <br /> Martha Ray, Cass Elliott and Billy Hayes are all as wonderful as the magicians, and Living Island gives them all they have within personal claims (including Billy Barty, Felix Sila and other famous names). There's a lot of acting in this film - there's nothing really hidden, and when Jack Wild is forced to show his interest in the kidnapped population on Living Island, it's more than a scream. This is a comedy drama dotted with a shovel. Although I'm thinking about it - I could never afford flute. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned different but also Zap The World and Pufnstuf and even Touch Jack Wild if touched. What's more, it's now on a CD of smart people at El Records in London. See here for more information: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
