"Lady of Shanghai" is known as one of the most troubled Hollywood movies. The original pieces of Welles were produced by the producers and were cut into strips. This has made the confusing mystery story even more difficult to follow. They publish a good name for its dialog because of the intensity of the Irish dialect, and the dubbing is very clear and poorly implemented. The most disastrous of all, both Wales and his real-life wife, Rita Hayworth, are collapsing in their relationship, and their noisy chemicals come on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is overcome by the wonderful direction of Orson Wells is. It makes the film elegant and incredibly atmospheric - it seems that every scene breathes your back from the screen. Also, characters and scenes are very curious that they border on dream and surrealism. This strange sensation raises the scenes that are often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequence in the middle. I usually find that courtroom drama bears a great impact, but the direction of Wales and exotic touches make it just as wonderful as everything else. Remember the end at the carnival David Lynch almost. <br /> <br /> The representation here is also very good. Despite their failed relationship, Welles and Hayworth offer decent performances - but their interactions do not exist. Everyone is wonderful and very enjoyable, especially Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders. The "lady from Shanghai" is obviously suffering from her problems, but it is worth watching one of the film's masters at its best. (8/10)
