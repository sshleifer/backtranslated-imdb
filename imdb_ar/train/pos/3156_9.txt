Like the characters at this show, I was also a teenager during the 1970s. The producers have already named the spirit of the whole age, as a teenager in the suburb in the seventies. Fashion in the seventies of the last century, cars, home furnishings, foods and creations are very authentic in this show. I really like the sequence of unique films of a doped type. No other display does camera tricks like this. These sophisticated cinematic sequences help to convey the awareness of luxury that characterized the 1970s. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very funny comedy. The only thing that bothers me about this show, is the excessive reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughter. That way, I think this show tries to be like a lot of married with children. While "Married with Children" is a wonderful play in itself, it is difficult to create innovators in the "Seventies" in an attempt to imitate them. <br /> <br /> I recommend the 1970s show, mainly due to nostalgia. It can be a better offer, if the writers rely more on intelligent dialogue, rather than counterfeit jokes and contention.
