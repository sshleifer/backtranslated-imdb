The fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. This film looks like a beautiful painting that should be enjoyed. The museum scene looks like a nice music video. Sex scene apres is a very familiar scene in all our adult lives. But the film will not have any interest for me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is probably one of the most active players of our time. Almost all I know about acting came from his eye study mostly. He had the most persuasive face. His personality possesses the qualities he has shown in man and his sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is awesome. BTW, I wish he would shave his beard now because his lips, Golan and Adam's apple were the most beautiful collection of his eyes
