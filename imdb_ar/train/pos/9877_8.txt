<br /> <br /> Introducing Lily Mars is one of the types of movies that seem to have disappeared with regret with the studio system. Well, after you know Millie, here are some of the reasons why I think this film stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lilly March (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star, and wins the heart of her director (van Hevelin) Hollywood story beautiful about that period, but the book change the subject slightly More than usual. Although Leila gets a big break when the star leaves, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a simple role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Jodie Garland (enough!) <br /> <br /> 3. The support team includes some really great shows. Spring Nightton as a truly wonderful night parent, as well as Fei Pinter (mother of the director - John Thornaway (Van Hevelin)). However, the outstanding supporting performance characterizes actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, the once-turned actress to the stage guard. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. One of those films designed to make you feel comfortable with the world and your dreams.
