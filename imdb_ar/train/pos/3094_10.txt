This is the best and most original show that was seen years ago. Whenever you see it whenever it falls in fine. Cast excellent, writing wonderful. Personally I love every character. However, there is a favorite character of all where there is a good mix of characters and backgrounds as in real life. I think that ABC has hurt writers, representatives and potential audience at this fair, to cancel quickly and not to advertise it adequately or to give it a real chance to win the following. There are very few programs I'm watching anymore as most TV shows are appalling. This offer in my opinion was really there with my favorite Graz Anatomi and my brothers and sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters will love this show if they know it. Why is it always a losing proposition that gets a lot of extra time and winning offers with great potential always get rid of the spot. I am very sick of programs actually do not watch any of them. It was very refreshing to have a new idea of ​​the show, and then to hire excellent representatives, this was a great promise. The last episode was the best, as everyone was already getting to their parts and making the show real. Please watch this offer on ABC Video and inform ABC that you want to restore this offer.
