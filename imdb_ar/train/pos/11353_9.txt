This film was excellent. It details the conflict between the detective committed against the stubborn ignorance of Russia's corrupt communist regime in the 1980s. This film has been given high marks because it is a non-proscribed view of the birth and development of a criminal investigation into an isolated world community (thanks to the "regime"). This is a graphic film. It provides a non-violent picture of violence and tragic residue. There is nothing "coated candy" with exaggerated blood or gore to separate us from the harsh reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andr√© Chicatello. I am familiar enough with the real story to get a deep appreciation of their retention of the film. It is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate the dry and dark humor, this film must be seen.
