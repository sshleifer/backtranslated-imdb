As a low-budget institution in which filmmakers themselves make and distribute DVDs themselves, we may not expect much from Broken in the form of a CD. However, the most striking thing about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with an additional number of plugins to frustrate James Cameron DVD and display very well. <br /> <br /> With regard to the latter, the only major drawback is that the broken comes with a non-distorted visual transmission. Otherwise, we got the movie by 1.85: 1 original, which shows no technical flaws and looks pretty as expected. In fact, given Ferrari's approach in assembling this disc together, you can guarantee such a fact to a great extent. <br /> <br /> The same applies to sound. Here both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​mixes are presented and while I'm not sure which of them should be considered "native", the fact that Ferrari had a role in both methods should not be considered inferior. In fact, although the DD5.1 ​​may provide a more air-conditioned viewing experience due to the way the result is used, both are equally good and free of technical flaws. <br /> <br /> For plugins, the disk is positively overshadowed. Take a look at the sidebar to the right of the screen and you'll notice many comments and lots of different features and exhibits. In fact, given the way in which everything has been divided into small segments rather than assembled into a long documentary, there is little debate really. For example, the "Anatomy of a Stunt" feature is exactly what it claims to be, and the same applies to the rest of the pieces. As such, we get the ever-sufficient coverage of Procin production before production, production and post-production. Although it may be better to find them in a general "making" that is easy to digest, this way we easily get any special feature we might want to display. <br /> <br /> If so, comments may be the only ones that need any kind of discussion. Then again, there is also predictable air for each of the chat tracks. The person who is involved is too jokey and does not take the film seriously. Ferrari cut incredibly excited about everything. That technique is, well, very technical. Of course, we also got some crossover with what was covered elsewhere on the disks, but in just 19 minutes, none of these pieces succeeded in welcoming. In fact, all in all, pack fine additives.
