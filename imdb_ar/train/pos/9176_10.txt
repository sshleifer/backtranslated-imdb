This review comes about 30 years late. However, it should be noted that I ran into a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it over and over for 4 consecutive months! I had to write about it! I was sober and forgot about anything else when I watched this movie. How ridiculous it is to see the heroes of male heroes portrayed by handsome men! After, what a welcome ridicule! It was quite right for me because Timothy Dalton achieved his role. Stunning performance and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like it! All other actors are very very good. The whole movie was put together beautifully. I do not care what anyone says about this film. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. I was a bit crushed to say this but I prefer to use Jane Eyre 1983 on A & E's P & J, which I think is the final mini-series. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre's excerpts surprised me a bit at school. I have never read the book and I seriously know the story line well. Seeing this particular production made the story come alive for me and led me to near frenzy. The scenes and Mr. Dalton's voice were endless, and finally led me to read the book seriously, which of course was a masterpiece. Bravo for the whole team especially for Mr. Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give the rating 10/10.
