I have watched this movie on DVD several times now, the first time, I watched the second half after the hour and then back to the first hour. A fun entertaining movie, thankfully no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and gives us all a real look at the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the film at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature that would offend the family. Children may be prompted to look a bit for Queen Victoria herself and perhaps lesser known personalities like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
