Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I am not a psychologist, but I have known them for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed an unusually good social world. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and control of the heartbeat and had a conscience but could not control himself in a wonderful way. I agree! What a chilling film. I have watched more than 2000 films and will put them on the list of the top 100 films. My friend spends life with clients like these on a regular basis. My only criticism was the narrative preaching at the end of the film. Many people grow up in conditions less than perfect, but only one in every million will act as losers did.
