Since Disney's bad divorce (with Disney retaining the Miramax label), Weinstein seems to specialize in films that are above average and are later promoted by a few. THE FLOCK is a prominent example. <br /> <br /> A story about civil servants who have a bad job tracking sex offenders, this photo will tell you more about sex offenders than a full season of law and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere offers his best performance ever as a pleasant, seasoned agent for the job. Clare Danis once has the opportunity to engage in a strong role (instead of the junk she usually stumbles on) and she makes the most of novice play. Cinematography, speed, editing, all of it first-class --- I did not see any trace of the camera that lacked attention, camera disturbance or excessive camera cuts that others complained about. This subject is treated with restraint, but it is still a difficult subject and may get you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem in the types of sexual crimes here that are abundant and will hit even the lax. Then came the decisions of the Supreme Court which simultaneously linked the hands of the police as "rights" sex offenders were opened and turned America into a shopper's paradise for sexual deviation, whether ready or unwilling. Every such move was greeted with praise by liberals, who celebrated the bad works of Warren's Court with shiny covers in Time and Newsweek. Liberals also praised the court every day and ridiculed those who disagree. In 2007, the number of Americans who know that this type of pornography depicting brutal violence and torture of young women - can be subscribed to, and is supported by the reduced patrol rate by the US Post Office. Only one part of the problem - a problem that can shake anyone's family. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but he does his best here. Maybe in maturity age he got some wisdom.
