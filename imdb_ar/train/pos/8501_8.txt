I think it's a great example of the differences between the two cultures. It will be a wonderful movie show in the sociology class. I thought it was very funny and I must say that I am a lollipop for that "lets band together and accomplish the task" plot device. It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It has a few exciting elements in it, and I think it blends well. Overall, I give it a solid 8.
