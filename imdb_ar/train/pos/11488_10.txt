I hired Zero Day from the local video store last week. I have never heard of the film and my reservations about it. Just looking at the box, I knew that the film was a film of Indie films, so the quality will be less than the normal film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day, I started playing it right from the start again. The film clearly followed the basic outline of what happened at the Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was the extent to which key actors believed. The first time I saw this film I was not quite sure if what I was seeing was actual tapes left behind by the shooters in Columbine. At the back of my mind I knew that what I was watching could not be real, but at the same time the acting was so compelling that it was you who continued to give your head a shake. <br /> <br /> Is the movie disturbing? at all! Are you going to see things that will make you doubt the merit of the film? Likely. I think what most people will find disturbing is that they will actually feel two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Kick). Why is this a problem for some people? Calvin and Andr√© plan to massacre their high school. I know myself, I felt very sad for Andre and Calvin. I have sympathized with them because their lives have reached this appalling point. They fell so deeply in the cracks that they began a journey on a road that could have been stopped, if only people around them had noticed their ordeal. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a great movie. It gives you a close and personal view of events that most of us will only see in the news. It makes you think about the life involved. Leaving you puzzled by the way people get to this point. A week after watching this movie, I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Those who have not seen the day of Zero Day, please pay attention to the following: Independent movie with little or no budget and the film is shooting on video cameras. The material in the film is annoying. This is not the prevailing Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put it all aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and may help you open your eyes slightly.
