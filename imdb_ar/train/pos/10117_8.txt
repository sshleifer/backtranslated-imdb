The story of the drunken, the head of his farm for sheep, the daughter of the President is not to all tastes, but it is still very interesting. It is happening in beautiful New Zealand, among the scenes we have known well through other films from this region. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw the excellent Mary Reagan, and I have been her lover ever since. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is likely to be remembered by the best American audiences from Smash Palace. Terence Cooper takes on the role of farm owner who pays little attention to his daughter (Reagan). <br /> <br /> She behaved sharply, with shows that crashed in an unforgettable way from all her threads. I saw this movie for the first time in a very modified picture on late-night television here in America, but believe me, you should not miss the unmatched version.
