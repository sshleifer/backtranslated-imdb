My interest was raised when I turned and saw the name Eviginia. My name is Eugenia so I thought well, let's see what this is. I am very glad I stayed on the canal. What a wonderful story and wonderful. Drama, sadness, and some acting at the top but had a wonderful time. I watch this, which makes me sad for all that the film industry has hidden and surpassed these beautiful little jewels and tried epigenia, and I hope you enjoy it as you did. I got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. Start slowly, however, the drama will embrace and your attraction will be to the story. Watching this beautiful film made me want to frown myself into more Greek tragedies and novels.
