Imagine that I was about to miss this great cultural event on Swedish television last night, which was because my friend insisted on keeping the TV on (to make it easier to sleep!) I saw an ad about her earlier but of course he forgot about her and looked up to " ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - this must be a fairly unusual idea - to set up a documentary film about an interview that has been more than 30 years old. But with an animated film and other documentaries, it adds to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most admired literary artists of the 20th century - George Remy, also known as Herge. <br /> <br /> Sure, Tintin will read albums with a different eye after watching this movie, which facilitates the delivery of differences in style as well as content with different periods in the life of Herg√© (and I can tell you that I will get as little as possible soon) I do possess). Of course, I have changed my perception of albums over the past 25 years and have already read them, and my view of my favorite albums has changed, but this adds at least another dimension to them.
