Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best feeling of this kind. Both Gooding and DeNiro offer outstanding leadership performance, and the support team is uniformly excellent, with outstanding performance by Karl Lumbley and Michael Raboport. <br /> <br /> The only "fool" I have chosen is that Theron's role was unnecessary and fragmented (and not so well performed, it seems that the film adds unnecessary viewers to accommodate its role.) <br /> Regardless of The characteristics, dynamics and real life story are rich and memorable. The developments of the main characters and how their experience develops with their beings are characterized by performing artists. Despite the maximum length of the film, speed remains. The result is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Is this Hollywood movie predictable? She defies. So, addicted to Mike Lee should put up a star, but everyone else must enjoy it strongly.
