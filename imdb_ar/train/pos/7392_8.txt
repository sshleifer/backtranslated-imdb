I love this movie very much. She has a wonderful chemistry between actors and tells a very global story, the story of the prodigal son. But the side that I liked was how the bathroom of the house was more than just a background to the story. As the father told the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing became almost sacred rituals. The water was so scarce that the simple bath had deep depth and depth. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was very effective. However, there were moments, when I approached the sweet "sweet" ... over the waving while scene theater in the garden. But overall, I highly recommend this film.
