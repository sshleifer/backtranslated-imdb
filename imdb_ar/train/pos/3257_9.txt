I saw this movie for the second time on television. It's beautiful, warm, emotional, very romantic too. I rarely saw actors more able to detect them through the movements and gestures she likes, namely Sheppel Sheppard, Ryan O'Neill and Robert Downey Jr. Especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply superior to themselves. Masterson is perhaps the most difficult and only adorable role. <br /> <br /> The film is part of both romantic films like "While You're Sleeping", "Harry Met Sally", "Sleeps Plus" in Seattle, and "High Trick" movies like Big, Back to the Future , Peggy Su married. I hate to say this, because this actor was wonderful and I never changed him - but I think he did not succeed as well as the above movies because the box office's attractions were not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of the film's making. <br /> <br /> It's not superbly written - for example, character lines are not particularly memorable. However they are performed to perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic longing is really clear, the "feeling" of the people who fall in love is brilliantly connected, the immortality in love and the total invasion of all, the sense of loss and the desire to regain this contact, very touching has been connected. Over and over, you'll find yourself moved. In fact, there is a similar film made in the sky - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See this - it's beautiful.
