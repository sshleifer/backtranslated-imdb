As another reviewer puts it, Hanna's War is a wonderful film about a prominent person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who will become "Jan Drak the Jew". Unfortunately, I disagree and I do not agree that Miss Demers, since the leadership is so beautiful that it can not be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In fact, for me, its performance is not far from its beauty, but makes it more evident in the horror of sadistic brutality as a resistor. The performance of Maruschka Detmers brave, influential, honest or concept, and quite reliable. In other words for me "in the area". Of the opening credits. If you'd like to learn more about someone else's suffering for something they believe in and enjoy it dramatically, try Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers. My hat is also to Ellen Burstein as Hanna's mother a famous and well-known actress who could make an effort to give up the film. In this group effort is probably for the two actress but not the attitude "All about Eve."
