When I first saw this show, I thought it was fun. I watched it, and saw how Sarah turned around, like a character who sees the world ... revolves around her. I got it, but I did not laugh too much. <br /> <br /> On stage and in her program, she was racist, harsh, insensitive and self-centered. I did not get them at first, and I took everything in nominal value. Then she got to see her film, Jesus is magic. I think this was a prelude to Sarah Silverman Lee, who explained to me what "language" you speak. Like Marilyn Manson, she works hard to provide us with a host of terrible ideas and images, but you realize in the end that she is not an attack. It's a statement. Once you understand this, you find that you are happy because someone has finally given you straight. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to suggest that only smart people will understand, or that I hate this offer is to prove your folly. While I love a lot of "smart" presentations, I still continue to this day to see humor hinder your enthusiasm. I have the impression that it is good, but I do not understand it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I came in the end. <br /> <br /> The creators of this program work hard, each episode is loaded not only by dialogue and plot, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not collect anything to fill a time period and satisfy advertisers, and they seem to be on a mission to make the best offer they can put together. If I expect the future of this exhibition, I will say that he will follow the path of "capture development" and "freaks and obsessions." It will be canceled before the time comes and live in the hearts of the fans and on the DVD. But keep in mind, SSP creators, your audience is there, and we'll watch as long as they allow you to view.
