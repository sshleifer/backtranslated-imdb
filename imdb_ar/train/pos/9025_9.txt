The film belongs to the type of inventor - the underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring little representation to the story with many standard elements. He was well shot, well edited, with a lot of secondary roles that were well represented. <br /> <br /> Some have announced that this is a classic American classic. This is and more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the excitement of young inspiration." <br /> <br /> The film is a nice reminder that achievement can be born from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
