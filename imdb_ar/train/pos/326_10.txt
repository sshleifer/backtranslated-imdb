"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one reviewer, I was on many occasions laughing loud. Yellow is lively, playful, psychology, exploratory. Do not expect Bergman here. This film revolves around young people in the early 1960s to mid-1960s in Sweden, issues, read * contradictions *, faced by the nation and the world. At times, "Yellow" appears to be a serious social and political documentary film, with Lina conducting the main character and other interviews with both the general public and politicians (such as Olaf Palm at home). At other times, Yellow seems to be a mockery of this type of documentaries. All the time, Yellow is a personal documentary that explores Lina's life - her domestic life, her love, her political views, her own look. Is she a complete person? Complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. Above all this wonderful additional dimension of the director, Schumann, and his staff, who document themselves, document Lena. This is, for me, really gives yellow wings. Not only appear suddenly at very funny times and in some funny ways, to remind the viewer that this is imagination and art, but their presence is the same as another layer of the film; they portray themselves by photographing themselves. I remember Bjork music video the same quality ?? A music video about creating a music video, an infinite ad, with increased repetition and more painter. I think Sjöman probably had something similar in mind. While "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not be a cup of tea for everyone, it is certainly clever, intelligent, refreshing, comfortable, authentic.
