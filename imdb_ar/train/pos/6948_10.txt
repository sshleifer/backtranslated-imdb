The first time I saw this episode was a shock to me, and it was actually the first time I saw it "24". The speed with which things happen is amazing, which is surprising, interesting, and even interesting, as if you were reading a book; once you start it, it is very hard to stop it. From the moment Richard Walsh was talking privately to Jack about the possibility of a mole inside the CTU unit, I was sitting 6:40 hours, 10 episodes !!! (Sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind who does not care when he's interested) This series is one of the best. It builds in a way that contains a few different stories that are linked together. Recommended in everything!
