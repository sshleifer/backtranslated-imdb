I would certainly like to see the resurrection of the Seahunt series dating back to the latest with the technology they have today, it will restore the child's excitement. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke was my hero every week. Sonic for the return of a new naval hunt. We need a change in the speed of television and this would work for a world full of underwater adventure. By the way, thank you for such an outlet to view many views about TV and many movies. So, I think I have something to say. It would be good to read more points about the sea hunt. If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you allow me to send, or leave me to be in doubt and ask me to resign, if so, I must go so to do so.
