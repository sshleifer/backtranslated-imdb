This film contrasts with the first film about Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, if you look at Part Two as a separate movie, this is a very good movie. I remember seeing this in the early 1980s (and I turned to her target demographic audience at the time), and I loved her more than the first film (not that I did not enjoy it too, it seems that this video is a little extra). It's certainly darker than the first one too, but maybe that's why it's so good. It's dark in the deepest, most slow way (kids may not understand it perfectly, but they may be too scared because of the atmosphere they are playing, and watching adults will certainly be faster because I'm watching this movie again now in my mid-20s) Sinister in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But just watching it as a child, certainly as I said, may have been a bit scary, but nothing painful. In fact, if anything had given me another fantasy game I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you how many times I used to pretend that Dark Heart wanted to jail me, ask me to help him pick up Bears Care, and try to make me go back to his dark side, and other things like that, etc. The film was also good for my imagination. She also enjoys great emotional depth. I used to watch it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for the sound of the heart of darkness (I always think so and always will). <br /> <br /> Now it's so bad because they never made soundtrack available. Sometimes, I just want to hear "Growing Up" without watching the movie, as it is good. <br /> <br /> "What is love and care if it can not save it?"
