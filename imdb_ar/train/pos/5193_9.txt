Fighting with the sword was out of this world, where the stunning scenes were fought without flying on the wiring techniques (until the end) that became very common today. Perhaps the scene with Chan and Barray is the highlight of the film. The characters in the attack on the Palace of the wicked were vulgar but the film was relaxed. A syringe of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> It was not possible to predict the plot of transitions, twists and turns and could not tell who was good or bad or who the people were. <br /> <br /> Good sense of suspense and surprises in time. The depth of the story is too intense for a film of this kind and reaches you in ways that most kung fu clicks do not.
