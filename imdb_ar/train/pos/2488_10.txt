For me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the Press Foundation, deserves to see this smart chip and immortality from politics (especially the campaign phase). If the "real-life" poles are the only ones who will respond as intelligently and clearly as Mr. Harris did, the arrogant members of the press who serve themselves may think twice before showing "irrelevant" trash that has nothing at all to do with the candidates' To effectively meet the challenges of the Office it seeks to achieve.
