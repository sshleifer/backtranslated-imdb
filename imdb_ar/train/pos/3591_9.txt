I never bothered to watch this movie in theaters although I remember hearing the name over and over again. I finally saw this week and it was a joy. For some reason, I expected that it would not be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck to it and then found myself completely involved. I read a lot of other user comments and was impressed by how many people we talked about fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana was that she was a real fighter in life. All you need is to find her place where she is from and help her ring in getting there. It's a very smart story and I'm surprised that this is the first time you've hit Michelle Rodriguez - it's an excellent job she did. Adrian and her coach were also good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it does not matter at all. The story, will and performances perfectly outweigh any flaws (which usually come with indie filmmaking anyway). A convincing image of a girl finds herself and wins over her circumstances and another for Michelle Rodriguez!
