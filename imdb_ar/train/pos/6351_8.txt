When Greenwich came out I was enthusiastic though I thought it would be a lucky film because I was happy. Although he had a little nightmare before Christmas touch it. You know the kind of dark and scary. I loved this movie because it helped fill people with the spirit of Christmas. So most of them Grinch saved Christmas. What happened well in Whoville says the small heart of Grinch grew three sizes that day. Merry grind!
