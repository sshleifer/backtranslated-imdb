All this sweeping drama is: First acting, stunning photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of the two films. Jessica Lange performed an incredible performance (she had to run for the Oscars). Liam Neeson is a fantastic starring role. Tim Roth plays one of the most sinister villains in the history of the film (nominated for the Oscars). John Hurt is as excellent as Lord Montrose, another unpopular figure. I am always amazed at the range of wonderful personalities that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man, and will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. This is the basis for this story. The honor of the ordinary man against the corruption of nobles. This movie is very interesting, it should appeal to everyone. She has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and her intriguing plot. One of my favorite movies.
