A man adjusts life alone after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the problem of the family's milk cow, Tulip, who refuses to allow herself milk. So, that is, he depicts his wife who used the milk of Tulip. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told by the Griffiths about her ancestral generation. The film is a look back nostalgic in a hidden way of life, where people still feel a sense of responsibility towards each other, in the Victorian green countryside (Australian state, not the era). It is clear that writer and director Griffith has other ambitions in both areas, and this short 15-minute film and award-winning is a great start to her vocation.
