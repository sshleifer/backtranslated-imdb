A pleasant surprise! I expected a further reduction along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an excessive film. Perhaps this is why a few agree on this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Intelligent dialogue instead of sudden vocabulary, background / decent motivation instead of shaky stereotypes, and when the chase came I was so avid to it. Panboiz expect Armageddon: Stay away. This is one of the most intelligent business enthusiasts. It did not bother me until Jolie looked a bit.
