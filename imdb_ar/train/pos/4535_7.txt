The first 50 minutes of this film was very boring. He focused on the personal problems that Doyle faced, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, the opportunistic publisher and feelings of guilt about his mentally ill father. Although these themes had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. In the end, we looked at Doyle's head, how Holmes invented and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden film by Tim McInerney and Arthur Conan Doyle, an important role played by Douglas Henshal and Brian Cox as "role models" by Charles Holmes, The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera worked superbly. If the first 50 minutes are as good as the last 40 minutes, this may be a small masterpiece.
