I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, first when Sarah was full of terror when she was sliding, I thought it was a scary sight and I think when you see it, your nerves in your body reach you; it makes you feel sad and scared faster. I loved watching Cliffhanger, and I think Silvestar Stallone is a fantastic actor and I think he will know he plays Rambo and Rocky.
