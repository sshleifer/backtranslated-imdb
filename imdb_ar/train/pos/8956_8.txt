I watched this movie after watching Majestic, and the older film was superior. I liked the way they changed their lighting, make-up and fashion as Gillian changed in the story. Jimmy Stewart's actions were not great for me in this film, but I suppose she worked to highlight Gillian's personal reserve. I was also struck by the behaviors of Nicky and Gillian - it was as if the director wanted him to appear in disguise and show Gillian male. Nicky's gestures when he shows Redditch his strength have shocked me. I never thought that the charming creatures were deceptive, so it was an interesting way to compare those characters.
