At the time I write this, I see that out of more than 15,000 votes, I got a rating of 5.8. There is something wrong with that picture. I personally give it 10. I can see at least 7 or 8 possible if it is rated by people who have seen this movie as it really is. It is a film based on the comic book hero. This film won more than its share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. 5 wins and 26 other nominations ... there tell me it's better than 5.8. Some great characters behave from some very good actors, some great special effects, and in my opinion they will be if they are not really classic for years to come. If you're looking for pure entertainment, make sure to visit Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is as great as Big Boy Caprice.
