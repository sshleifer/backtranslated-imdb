I will keep this review short and resolved .... <br /> <br /> I saw this trailer and thought I would give it a vortex in 5 minutes and my initial thoughts were "What the hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 minutes I was carrying my voice from the ground. This film is a great example of how different the film is, as well as French. This film is a high-quality candy, wrapped in an elegant futuristic film, a highly intelligent motion capture and black and white cartoon style that does not contain gray, although initially it did not do so for me. The end of the film and I found myself wishing every movie would be like this. I think my opinion was supported by the big dubbing that would have been so easy to destroy if many respected actors had not landed so many of the vocal actors do not feel the characters (just watch any Hong Kong legend in English to see an ideal example) From I gave it an extra 2 because of how new and new everything feels ....
