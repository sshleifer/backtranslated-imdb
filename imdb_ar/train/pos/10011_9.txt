I enjoyed the night listener so much. It is one of the best summer movies. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams offers one of his best performances. In fact, the entire staff was very good. Everyone just played the right notes for their personalities - not much and not much. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Tony Collett is awesome as a mother and never goes to the top. Everyone is very reasonable. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, less than an hour and a half. I noticed that the release of the public offering was nine minutes shorter than the Sundance release. I wonder if some of the most disturbing pictures have been cut from the film. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it directly, a refreshing change from many of the directors these days who think they believe the job is convincing the audience rather than telling a story and telling it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be a sucker for punching and previewing. It's not Hitchcock's story. Watch the night listener because you want to see a good story. If you go expect Hitchcock, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film was the end. The director could have left a little more to the public imagination, but this is a simple representation.
