As the romantic comedy goes, this was a nice win. I thought the writing could have been stronger to build the final connection slightly better, but this is not a huge starting point. However, Amanda Dietmer and Scott Wolfe make nice and charming performances as they have always done. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was pleased to see them represent a romantic fantasy. I hope to see them throw in more projects soon. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet and warm and won. Not a bad thing to be at all.
