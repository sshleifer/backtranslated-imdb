This movie hit home for me. Since I am 29, I remember that my father worked in a factory in the 1980s. I would imagine, if you worked hard too, if I were proud and never gave up I could also get the American dream, home, a few children, a car to call me. I noticed that without a degree (unlike my father who resigned in the ninth grade) and a sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It was made for television, and I saw it an hour ago. I cant find it anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, fake friends, family members and other relatives. Look at what they think and remind them that once, the Americans will work for a sense of honor and we are proud of what we are doing !! I think the feeling is still present, but in a dense downward spiral with lots of things out there ...
