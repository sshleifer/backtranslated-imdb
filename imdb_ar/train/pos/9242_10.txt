Is it difficult to classify films like this, because you put it on production or is it just fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again in about 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it started a long life with the magic ninja. The plot is pretty awesome and the representation is terrible of course, but there is a certain ambiguity surrounding the ninja in this film which makes the atmosphere very good. What is important is to be fighting scenes, while the "little" of contrast, really good. <br /> <br /> I must say that it was better when I was young, now only I can see the outrageous points of unreasonable nonsense. In the film, but as the film "Sit with a few beer" martial arts, I can not fault it, it delivers a much better than the "American Ninja" mountains like the garbage that spread in the eighties of men wearing black suits but in fact They are not good fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another ninja film under the banner of the film "White Phantom" and I have no idea if this is supposed to be a complement to Sakura But the Sakura clan is once again a major feature, including the same motto and similar story this time only including the white ninja.It had a small sense of atmosphere, but the scenes of fighting are more explicit and frank, so terrible. > So, if you love martial arts, you should explode to kill a few hours!
