Dave Anand (or Prashant) and Zenaat Aman (Jasper / Janice) are brothers who grew up in single parent families. Jasper grew up in a rich environment, but that was not enough to lead her to reject her life and join the Hippie movement, which eventually led to drugs. Prashant (brother) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a mature man. The story shows that Brashant made efforts to rescue his little sister (who was always in ecstasy) from the hostile Hippie environment. This film stands in the test of time, commenting that sects and hippies are a place for those who give up their lives when they have to instead stand in the face of adversity. The wonderful musical works in this film mean different things in different situations and different people, and the director brings him a strange feeling.
