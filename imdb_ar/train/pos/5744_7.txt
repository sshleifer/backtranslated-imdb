This was in the second or so. On a Saturday morning a few years ago, for various reasons I do not remember the whole story but the rest of the highlights of the central characters. Dom had a lot of unfortunate things, where he was literally exploited and employed in a garbage job, where Eugene split his personal aspirations and duties toward his brother. Tom Holmes Dome does not call sympathy - it comes naturally. Ray Liotta is a world away from Henry Hill, showing a finely tuned position in what should feel a disdainful attitude. <br /> <br /> This deals in many ways with the dilemma of many young caregivers - past or future. As it turned out, with some work the two can coexist happily. Dealing with thoughtful and sensitive playing Dominic and Eugene is hard not to warm up.
