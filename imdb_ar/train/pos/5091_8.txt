See both parts twice. I enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing Patrick Sweezy as a hero. He was very honest as the hunter Alan Quartman and certainly outperforms Richard Chamberlain. I admit I'd better see someone else as a "lady in distress". Allison Dodi must adhere to modern cutting, not time. Did not have a woman look of the 1800s. The rest of the cast was fantastic and followed the lines well. I am pleased to see that representatives of this generation are not afraid to experience different personalities and are not afraid to be seen as older. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide it. The 50-year-old man can be sexier (Patrick is really sexy) and then a green guy, no matter how beautiful. Hoora's profile lines are in line with a wonderful smile.
