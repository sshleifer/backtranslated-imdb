I think it took a lot of courage to go this way. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers, it is the most helpful thing to people. But, in her case, what she did was wonderful. I have worked in mental health five years ago and I think it is wonderful that mental illness is no longer a horrible word and I think it helped. I always thought it was great and would always. I'm glad she wrote this book and that movie was made. She is a wonderful lady and I hope she will continue her work. It has gone through a lot and faced it. I really love to see her work more with children, especially children and actors. Her ordeal should not have happened and I think it will be great as a guide for young people. The film was moving me so much that I was very touched. Suffering from TBI that led to the onset of turbulence and PTSD, it is good to know that there is someone who has the courage to present his life as she did. I think it helped this nation and people in general to realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Ms. Duke, or Anna, which you prefer.
