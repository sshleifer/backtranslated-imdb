But the fun of the trip. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very interesting, not only that they both performed very easily on the eyes, and the humor of the support team and jokes made me actually laugh out loud several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, predictable, yes, it's a romantic comedy. But the point is that they are a sweet story, and the message about finding your true love one is also a fact in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is over and well represented in all parts, on the top of the comic effect. The Bulgarian scene deserves its weight in gold, and the actress there deserves a decent mention! For those who chose it to be predictable - if you want a movie with roles and turns that make you guess ... you want to stir up. This is a romantic comedy ... I touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it was worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> A wonderful history film, a wonderful movie for a happy scream ...
