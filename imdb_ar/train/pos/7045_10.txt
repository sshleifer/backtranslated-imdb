This movie definitely gets a thumb from me. It's a masterful joke, so she was sometimes overwhelmed by opinions throughout the film in some stereotypical and degrading images. It's a 100% smart and original plot, and you will be guessing throughout the entire movie. The only person I was impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. It is easy and simple to see that they jumped a leap in faith outside the kind of "flick" that they used to. Its excellent tone and performance in acting was well fragile and well executed. It's the best performance I have ever seen of Hillary, and I have watched most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "Britney Spears of Eastern Europe" and this shows in some of her behavior and song, "I want to blow you up ... even ...". She also feels sorry towards her, since her performance really understands, Yonica is a very complex and confusing personality. Jean Kusac laughed throughout the entire film with a sense of humor sometimes, as well as facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's intelligent dialogue is likely to make you brilliant. I highly recommend this film.
