The obsessive Catholic writer Gerard Reeve (Geron Krabi) is called homosexuality, alcoholic and has frequent visions of dying to lecture at the Literary Club in Vlesingen. While at the railway station in Amsterdam, he feels a disproportionate attraction to a handsome man starting on another train. Gerrard was introduced to the club's curator and beautician Christine Halslag (Rene Sutendijk), a wealthy widow who owns a sphinx shop and has a one-night platform. The next morning, Gerrard sees a picture of her friend Christine Herman (Tom Hoffman) and recognizes him as the man who saw him at the train station. Suggests that she bring Herman to her house to spend a few days together, but with the intention of seducing the man. Christine travels to Cologne to bring her boyfriend and Gerrard stays alone in her home. He decides to watch the footage and discover that Christine married the three men and died in tragic accidents. Later Gerrard believed that Christine was a witch and asked whether Hermann or he would be her fourth husband sentenced. <br /> <br /> The mysterious "The Vierde Man" is another wonderful feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch stage. The story is supported by an excellent scenario that uses Catholic symbols to build tension associated with intelligent dialogues; a wonderful display of heroin Krabi as a turbulent alcoholic writer; and stunning photography. The indecisive decision is open to interpretation as in many European films that explore common sense and intelligence for viewers. There are modest directors using the front nudity for men to promote their films; however, Paul Verhoeven uses Gerard Reeve's nudity as part of the plot and not aggressive or looking for excitement. Last but not least, the impressive beauty of Ms. Ren√©e Soutendijk is quite striking with the role of women who attract an odd writer. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O 4o Homem" ("The Fourth Man")
