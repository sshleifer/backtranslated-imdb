EA has made it clear to us that they can make 007 Classic Agent and make you feel in the sixties world. The game graphics are fantastic and the soundtrack is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after the release) and I still admire this game. It is shameful that EA no longer makes 007 game. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 levels, including the consulate level. I recommend this game to anyone aged 13 or older. The only thing I did not like in the game was the level of the Russian boat and it was a lot of pressure. On the whole I love A LOT !!
