David Lynch (1999) was put to the story of John Roach / Mary Sweeney in Iowa, long before the movie was finally released. <br /> <br /> We come to the life of Alvin Street (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His health is poor and his life is often behind him. <br /> <br /> This makes what he decides to do more exciting and loving. He decides (and at every stage in the film his name is repeated in his actions) to put some things right. <br /> <br /> By this time of his life, Alvin is a man with great but humble experience. Struggling his daughter Rose (Cisse Spacek) with a handicap in pronunciation makes communication a great effort on behalf of the public. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can only help out as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is a journey story. But like all trips, it is a journey in a geographical and human sense. Early in the film, we began to understand that this ambitious journey, no elderly man in the era of Alvin must do reasonably. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has a lot of qualifications to prepare for his potential goal. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and likely to die and wants to visit. He has had a disagreement with him for many years and has not spoken for a long time. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from his knowledge is the essence of this film. We come to know who is two thousand straight, from what he does two thousand straight. At the end of the film, we know who we are ... better.
