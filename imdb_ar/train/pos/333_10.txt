In all honesty, this classic series (as TV goes) is as much as the original poem of the world's literature. Far from being deceptive, it is a beautiful and respectful display of one of the specific texts of Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the plight of Odysseus and his followers; it touched on the drama of the fall of Troy (which I felt but did not see); (It should be noted that the gods that appear here are not silly CGI creatures flying around on ankle wings, or bad bikini models, as in the case of Homer, they act through human agents, rarely represented by a classic statue). <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that it is not available on DVD, especially given the very meager and structural adaptations of Odyssey that one can find in video stores.
