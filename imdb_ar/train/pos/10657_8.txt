Jeopardy has a sense of being a kind of movie - one of the movies that studios have channeled between big-budget office films and the box office. It's just 70 minutes and does not have many groups, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a hard-line woman once again escaping to a conviction that she ran away while seeking help for her besieged husband in the Mexican desert. Most of the film focuses on how she deals with her captors, whom he wants to give him for his help. Some psychological fighting there. <br /> <br /> It's an amazingly effective little movie - its short length makes it tight, and Stanwick should be great without mention (but I still praise it every time).
