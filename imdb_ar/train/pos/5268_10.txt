Maybe barbarians are not the best film any of us have seen, but really ???? ........ It is very funny ...... I can not describe how I laughed the amount when I saw it for the first time .. The director really wanted to make a serious film for adventure, but it is very bad .... Bad So much so that it's one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see it ..... and if you have done so, you should see it again !!!!!!!
