This movie is just a lot of fun. I've seen it a few times, but I always have something funny to remember. The "duck and rabbit" scene is one of my favorite things, and I still quote the Moron versions of some words! <br /> <br /> There are lots of jokes going on, it's great. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
