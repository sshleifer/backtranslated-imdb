A very bold drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, "Home Sweet Home". This reminded me of the application of Billy Tang "Run and Kill", although it is not polished like this. However, it is part of an attractive chaos around a single Cambodian person, Hu Bang (Edison Chen), who arrived in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While escaping from the scene, the policeman's partner, Sam Wai, is killed, to insult the injuries, in the midst of his dealings with his dying father, so Sam begins a crazy and obsessive hunt for Pang that leads to nearly ten bodies and unrelenting violence. There must be something in the air recently because I have never seen so many people beating the pulp from each other as I have seen recently. These bad things are bad, that is why I am part of it, I salute her pessimistic atmosphere. It is eye-catching, and the sound design is unique. Dramatically, everything spiral down until you find each character himself or herself in a world of screaming pain. Adding a sub-chart that includes Bang's link to a sexually abused girl deep into the story and actually generates a surprising fourth that boasts a wonderful surgery.
