If you have any kind of appreciation for personality, dialogue and any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. It may have been a play, and that is why the dialogue was heavy, but I can not emphasize enough about how to make these symbols, which we have only a shallow understanding of the complex figures really wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film is better than any college course to tell you how to create a story based on personality. <br /> <br />
