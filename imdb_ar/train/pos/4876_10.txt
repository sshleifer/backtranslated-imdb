I do not know why some men from the United States, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who did not watch this movie - they saw it. Do not expect too much or do not put some frames just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor within it - the people of Serbia DID actually marry while Bill Clinton bombards their villages, the Roma in all Balkan countries are always trying to confront you in any way possible, love is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans very creative. For those who claim that this is a bad film, I can only see that the movie "American Satan" (like Meet Dave, Get Smart etc.) is much worse than a pure and frank romantic love story in the Balkans like Promise me. The comment should be useful and in the second place it should represent the writer's personal vision. I think the film is wonderful and people watching it should give their respect to the director and the story that I narrated from inside. It is simple but real. It's brutal, but cute and makes you laugh to the dead.
