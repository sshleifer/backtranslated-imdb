It's hard for me to criticize anything that Metzi Kaptor does. She only radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is an enormous actress. However, yes, the plot was expected. I think if Gil Rich had slept with Richard, he might have made him even crazier than he really was, which would have added more suspense. It was also good to see Gil and her husband discover Richard's small problem with his ex-wife, and maybe a little more. I was a little disappointed with the end of the film. I wanted to see more closure on Zach's death and possibly closure with her husband. I have to say that I will never be able to look at a luminous gun and I do not imagine it stands there. It was a very suitable end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I am looking forward to future projects.
