Watch this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a question and answer afterwards. <br /> <br /> I've struggled to believe that this is the first director of all magazines to Harvey Keitel for once again risking and getting out on a limb to get the script he likes. <br /> <br /> The Paradiso Cinema certainly reminds us of the young director's story of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a film about the revolution. The political situation is wonderfully ambiguous. There are many references to the directors, namely the obvious love of the history of the film (a wonderful tribute to "Bike Thief") and some eccentric scenes that operate without being tone. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
