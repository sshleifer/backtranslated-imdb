Well, maybe this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and loved so much that I've memorized most of the text (especially the scene in the volume when Jerry breaks my wind) and even with the script I still love watching it with Jerry Lee, that the German Shepherd is hysterical and already undergoing the test to see Who is smarter. The tag line is correct as well. Not to mention that the acting is wonderful, although Christine Tochi looks different in whisper (see Filmography under CSI if you do not know what I mean). It is very bad that this film contained only the one issue that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with, and it was wonderful to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had.
