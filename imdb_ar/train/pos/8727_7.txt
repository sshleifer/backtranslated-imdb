Bugs life is a good movie. But for me, it really does not compare with movies like game story and stuff. Do not get me wrong, I loved this movie, but it was not as good as Toy Story. The film contains pictures, laughs, and other stories that Toy Toy carried. But the movie did not feel quite ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a good film. <br /> <br /> A life free from mistakes ... I do not want to say this, it's a film I can not remember. I've seen him for years. Of course, I have not seen a game in years, but I still remember it. I should not review this film, but I am. I give it a thumb, although it is not exactly the best work done by Pixar. <br /> <br /> Life errors: *** / ****
