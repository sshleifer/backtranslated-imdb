Coming from the same director as "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that it's a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a film I've never heard of yet, but it must be one of the best films in the late 1980s - partly because this is the worst film in recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here.) Acting is not wonderful, but it is just a crucifixion - contrary to what some people here claim (they must have dreamed of this "amazing representation", much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that binds all the loose sides together. These questions are likely to be left unanswered, leaving the matter left to the individual to explain, and there is nothing wrong with a subject like this. "Pepperhaus" is a fairly unusual combination of children's films and horror, with the effective use of sounds and music. I love the fact that the central personality is not your vulgar social girl, but it is a wonderful child. I am fed up with the writers who display their childhood like mixing in their books and screens, as if anyone who cares anymore to watch or read about another lonely childhood is as lonely as if this were all or as if it were a personal background with a monopoly of potential Good. The scene with Anna and the boy was "sneaking" (for a long time) to a large extent - both nausea and amusing amusement - since she was supposed to be 11 years old, but it is expected to show that Burke was thirteen When this was filmed. I have no idea why I did not upgrade my age or get a young actress. It was quite clear that Burke was not small. Why do directors always cast older children than they play with, and thus reduce realism, and I will never know.
