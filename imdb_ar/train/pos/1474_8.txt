I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. This three-part documentary (every 50-minute episode) is not as nice as it seems, featuring Slovenian philosopher / psychologist Slavoy Zizk. Zizk takes us on a journey through many classic films and explores themes of sexuality, imagination, morality and death. It was directed by Sophie Finn, of the multi-talented Vince clan (a sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this a bit, although I think it would be more fun on a DVD, because there are such ideas that you should digest. Freudian and Lacanian analysis may be very heavy, and seeing the entire series at one time has become somewhat confusing at the end of two and a half hours. It was not helpful that bad coffee and bladder possession drove me to some discomfort during the past hour or so. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that Zizek chose films that were quite clearly filled with Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time in Hitchcock and David Lynch films, not a master's degree in precision. I wanted to see him trying to support his theories through the use of a wide range of films, although in fact I just say that I would like to see part four, fifth and sixth. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor he was watching offers what amounts to the level of the lecture while introducing himself into the actual scenes of some of the films he discusses. So, for example, we see him in a steamboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock the Birds) or sitting in the Motel Bates cellar (from Sico). This does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him, this certainly made me think a little bit about movies. That is precisely what he is trying to accomplish.
