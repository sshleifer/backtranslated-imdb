Although reading the "initial comments" of someone who did not like the film with curiosity - (why is the only negative comment that was first included in the list?) It was very good to note that everyone else loved it! It is clear that the Church wanted to emphasize some points and portray the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - that is the whole idea. In fact, those points were very effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... But, despite all that, and all the terrible negative attempts that the opponent has made, he has shown exactly how he was able to complete the wonderful work that God has given him. I highly recommend it to anyone!
