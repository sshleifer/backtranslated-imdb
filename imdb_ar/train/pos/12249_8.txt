Old Jane's cheerful tale is very common these days. I have lost a number of versions around. Perhaps the reason is that its "ruteness" is "our ruteness" even on this late date. This mini-TV series gives you a good, polite presentation of the novel. Emma is a pretty "modern" girl with a say, when you think about it, although the atmosphere of Jane Austen may look great for us today. If Emma has not looked, I'll just say that Emma is self-sufficient to get it. It's worth watching to see how. Actors here honor the ladies: Kate, Brunella, Lucy and Samantha. It was almost possible to have a psychological connection to the old Jin!
