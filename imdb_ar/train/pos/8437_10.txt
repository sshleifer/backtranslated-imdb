*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, I see that I am a big fan of H: LOTS, I probably liked the movie more than ordinary people. However, this film is still excellent. He had a lot of surprises, and gave more closure to the series. While I was sad because Pills turned into a killer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
