I really liked this film, it was very funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are fantastic actors, and I think that after watching this film they should make more films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into some trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles when you get out the door and then the other was very funny to watch him, he acted well in his film and I hope he makes More wonderful comics like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, plays his part well and is very upset and I am pleased that some of his amazing works have been noticed but he is a really good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays well. <br /> <br /> The inspirational is really good I really recommend this movie to everyone.
