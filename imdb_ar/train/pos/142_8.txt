The second part (episode 4-8 actually) of the successful Danish TV series is a little lower than the first part, but has a lot of laughter and fear as well. This time, Udo Kiir plays two parts, as a monster child and his father's likeness. Another prominent part of this time is Dr. Soren Belmarks Dr. Krugschug, who must face the terrible retaliation of Dr. Helmer, and once again, Ms. patience lessons are trying to solve puzzles, like Miss Marble. He ends up on a boat and after the death of key actors Ernest Hugo Jarigard (Dr. Helmer) and Kersten Rolls (Ms. Drews), they wonder how they will be able to make the third part, but I hope that von Fonner presents it as a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rutney Leavers, dishwasher No. 2 in Down syndrome, died soon after. Search for Stellan Skarsg√•rd in Hijab. ***
