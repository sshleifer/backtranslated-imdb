I was lucky enough to see this on a whim during a film festival and I was slapped hard with what I saw the next night I returned to the second of three shows. Any brutal and severe attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment is swallowed up negatively without being tasted by a target audience. The common denominator of a single journalist moving slowly to members because of guerrilla warfare is the ability to predict what the film is all about, Unpredictable and refreshing leave it after the credits expire with renewed hope, and excited that it is still possible to produce original films. Anyone frustrated by the unfulfilled expectations of something to shed light on his perceptions, it would be good to hunt (I mean this hunt) this item hardly seen. For Fight Club fans and any Charlie Kaufman movie, it requires viewing it for anyone who avoids plurality like a frantic dog.
