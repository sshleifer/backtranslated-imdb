I have seen hundreds of silent films. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings) but among them, my favorite film is the movie (may not be the best - but favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at the IMDb command, I noticed that I laughed immediately because the film was very nice and excellent. Marion Davis has shown in this film that she has a great talent and was not the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story includes a novel from Georgia coming to Hollywood with all expectations that it will be an instant star! Her experiences and stars of interest to the stars of the era make this game a real fun for the amateur and the film to watch!
