I've been enjoying all this insightful documentary, and I waited a good period to come across the pipe (the local video series) and it was worth the wait. I love a good piece of documentaries / special interest, but this was definitely honest and passionate, nostalgic and backward, if you will look back on the lives of teenagers. The child's imagination is wonderful, and here begins the great story. Rent it or buy it if you love a good documentary, humor and everything fun. Mr. Stein and his company have certainly cut a long way from producing Video CamCorder products from bank detentions, and gay episodes that turn gay people from one look. They all seemed to be fairly successful in areas that respected them, and it was good to know that they were all still close friends. The DVD contains a few additional trailers for other good documentaries, featuring some of Daren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
