I must say I really did not have any idea that I was sitting and watching this movie. I think it was the fact that I had nothing better between the class. But, once a TV movie caught my interest. More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye. In fact I was not very impressed by this film before. I definitely love the hurricane and as good as it gets. But, something about this film really did for me. I would now like to see myself as a great admirer. This movie comes with high marks of ... Lee. Give her a chance, she will not let you down.
