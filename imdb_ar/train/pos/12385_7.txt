Man, I really like the new DVD produced by Universal. I have never seen Centennel this sounds good because I had to carry the beloved Crazy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, no extras outside the trailer look worse to wear. Avoid Goodtimes DVD at all costs. She sucks. <br /> <br /> In any case, troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Christina Raines) moves into the stone of the haunted New York City, just more than just haunted. It is also a gateway to hell and the Vatican maintains an old blind priest (John Carradine) to observe it and make sure that the devils and arch angels will not escape. <br /> <br /> This includes stars full of old actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jos√© Ferrer and so on, as well as the stars of the next eighties including Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum were mysterious overduby) and Tom Berenger. You will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from law and order. I had to do a double job when I did not see where I'd seen it before. <br /> <br /> Nice scenes from Allison's eye dissection and autopsy of her rotting father's body of Satan. There is an elegant end where deformed and disfigured people try to chase Allison to suicide so that she is not the next step guarding the gate. It seems that the troubled past of Allison makes it a major candidate by the Vatican to become the next guard. <br /> <br /> A stunning classic in the 1970s directed by Michael Weiner, who should not be missed. I also recommended it to those who want something more creative beyond the usual stupid teenagers and comedy horror. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
