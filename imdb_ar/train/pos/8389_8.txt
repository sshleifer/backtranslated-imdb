This is the best of 43 films made by Rainer Werner Passbinder; his most successful at least. He was one of the main directors of the new Germany after World War II. <br /> <br /> Hanna Chigula was wonderful, where she found Maria Bruan, who lost her husband in the war after she took a US soldier. As a lover, he lost it again after he went to jail for her, and found him in the end. Her day and half of her marriage before his disappearance was longer than their time together at the end. <br /> <br /> This is life. Things come and go, and you can do the best you can. You can abandon your thinking or adjust it to stay. Although Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do, she did not stop loving Herman, making the end of such a tragedy. <br /> <br /> An excellent drama.
