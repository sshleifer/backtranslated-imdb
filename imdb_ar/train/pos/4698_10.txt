Just like the wine, Johnny Dangerous gets better and better with every day. This smart and powerful film can stand well on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's really wonderful. In fact, it is clearly the best film of its kind ... I am the most parody of mob films even in the period in question - although it is recognized that this position may be easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive and vulgar alternatives And blurred as the "Jane Austen Mafia".
