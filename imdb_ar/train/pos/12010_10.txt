Warning: Moderate spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing, even touching, link in American history and world religious history. This film depicts events in the life of Joseph Smith, which the Mormons offer as a prophet to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ to Earth. I have seen the film so far twice in its first month of the show. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith first appears to be the smallest group of three brothers (Alvin, Hirum and Joseph) who are very young, in need of surgery. The operation, which was done without our modern amenities, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped show the Smith family's cohesion and the ties between the brothers and Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayers that led to what Mormon called the first vision were interesting. Jesus' face never appears, but you can see the clear marks of the nail in his hands. The rejection of religious leaders and many in his small community in New York was rejected at least a little by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly explain the history of the Mormon Church, but it jumps from scene to scene. This is not cash - simply note about the method. <br /> <br /> The practice of erosion and feathers is displayed, which is particularly exciting and exciting when Joseph gives a sermon about the love of the Savior and a distorted face. Of the recent attack. <br /> <br /> The film brilliantly depicts the joy and growth of Mormonism as a small church, and at the same time the deep opposition that has spread in the heights of local governments. <br /> <br /> The film features many scenes from Yusuf's life, including a couple of beautiful moments depicting his relationship with Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his intense love for his wife, his endless love for the children, his wit, his courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings, and his affection. <br /> <br /> As Joseph and Herum ride to Carthage and never return to their homes alive, most of the characters from all over the movie, Joseph has normalized her life, appear along the way, helping to reinforce what has already been His vision but the last scene was prepared to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hirum is filmed, and the filmmakers are left to think about the events they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I assumed it was made by the church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think this is the case, although I hope the film can do it. As an internal factor, I find that the film is Yusuf's celebration and perfectly enhances the good things we already know about. I am curious to see how strangers will see the film - whether they will simply see it as a propaganda or epic story of an American cleric or anything else. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully filmed and family-friendly, moving, and hopefully, a good thing for everyone. The events already filmed in this United States are interesting to think about in light of the many facets of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect for the law (in general) of the law - we modernists consider it a Muslim.
