Wow, Jim Cary finally returned from his death. This movie made me laugh and cry. It also sends a message that we should all know and learn from. Jennifer Aniston was wonderful, and she would eventually get a successful movie under her belt. If you love a liar liar you will love this movie. I give it 9/10.
