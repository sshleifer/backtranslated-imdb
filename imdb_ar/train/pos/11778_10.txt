This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal aspects of the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings vitality to the book and adds more sense to the author's subsequent composition, * Collapse *. <br /> <br /> Diamond is an attractive and caring figure, not just an uninterested or uninterested academic. This series shows that his book was not merely a response to the need for "publication or destruction," as the academic says, but a thoughtful answer to the question of a person who respects him, "Why did you get so white? Because he respects the intelligence of the fluid and its community, Diamond has sought an answer that did not insult that information or that group. I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Park" "Bloom Canada": "Blum Wheat!"
