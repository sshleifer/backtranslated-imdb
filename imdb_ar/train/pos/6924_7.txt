This complex West was a milestone in the life of James Stewart after returning from military service, where he wanted to change his image by doing the West, which is largely the reason for the influx of Westerners in the fifties because it is very impressive. Too bad, not filmed in technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart won the first prize for "The Shotgun in the West", but then had to spend the rest of the film trying to retrieve him when he was stolen. Shelley Winters is a shady Jala with a bad reputation, and Steven McNally is the evil boy gunman in Dodge City. Will Gear is White Erb and Dan Doria is Shelley's bad friend. Do not you know that, being a global film world, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both completely unknown at the time) have simple roles. <br /> <br /> The interesting series includes the first Indian attack, where Charles Drake reveals himself as a horse riding horses, leaving Shelley alone in a horse-drawn carriage. He later reformulated himself, but it was just one of the twists and turns that carried the gun from one hand to the other - but in the end it ended up with the legitimate owner. <br /> <br /> Stephen McNally and Stuart Stewart are absolutely final shooters which is almost melodramatic (but not quite) like DUEL IN THE SUN's ultimate shotgun. McNally makes the ideal villain, and DANYEA is equally treacherous in this kind of evil role he played throughout the 1940s as a low-life weapon. <br /> <br /> The story is very carefully designed by Anthony Mann. It is interesting to see ROCK HUDSON (known as Young Bull) wearing the Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who takes a sneak look at the lean and attractive Shelley Winters at the time. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching and definitely worth seeing over a mediocre story.
