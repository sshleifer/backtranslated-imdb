When I started watching "Fay Grim", I had no idea it was a sequel to "Henry Fool". Now, the last film was not a film I imagined. But one has arrived, which is very good. I assume you saw the original, so I will not explain it. This begins with Faye (Parker Bossi), who lives with her son, who was suffering from Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Orbaniac) is still in prison. One day, the son is expelled to bring him a pornographic toy to school. But this is not a normal game. He keeps a secret explaining much of what happened in the first film. This mystery deepens in the geopolitics of Syriana. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am very impressed with what Hall Hartley has done here. Maybe this type does not reach the original quality perfectly, but it certainly takes a closer look at what is happening in the world. The end offers the possibility of opening another complement. <br /> <br /> Also starring Jeff Goldblum.
