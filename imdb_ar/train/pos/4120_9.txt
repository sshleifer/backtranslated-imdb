<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made his first film in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that focuses on many of the intricate stories that take place in a small Tokyo slum. <br /> <br /> The title comes from a voice that makes it mentally retarded when it imagines that it is running a train. Slowly we get to know more people in the small community, who are the drunkards who trade with wives because they are unhappy with who they have. The old man, who is in the middle of the city, helps in a robbery that is trying to steal him. Poor father and son who can not buy a house, so they imagine one house. At the end of the film, all the stories come complete, others feel happy and others sad. <br /> <br /> Since this was the first color film in Kurosawa, you can see that it uses it for its own sake and shows. Maybe a lot. This film goes in many different directions, and it is difficult to settle in it. But do not get me wrong, the D-Ka-Den may not be the best for Kurosawa, but he's coming from the greatest director ever, much better than 99% of today's movies.
