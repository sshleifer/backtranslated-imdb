When I heard that Patrick Swayze finally returned to his acting career with King Solomon's mines, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones action adventure. What I got was 4 hours long (with commercials) which was very slow. It was possible to drop the second and third hour completely and the story would not be exposed to it. The end was good (there are no spoilers here) but I still wanted more. Well, all anyone can do is to prey on Swayze by "RoadHouse 2" so he can return to the type of movement that made him famous. Even if you're a fan of King Solomon Mines, read the book or watch a 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is not very good but only forty-four minutes of your life went instead of 4 hours.
