Full House is a fantastic show. I still grew up today. I started watching him when I was 8 and now I'm 12 years old and still watching him. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. Are favorites. She had such a humor. If there are people on this scene who are barely viewing the show, you should contact them. I became addicted after the premiere I saw, which happened to be the first episode in 2002. It's really a good show. I really think that this offer must go on to many generations in captivity. It is also wonderful because it is suitable for all ages. For all parents, it teaches children the lessons about how to continue their lives. Nothing terrible happens, like violence or insults. It's just a really great sit-in. I give it 5 of 5 stars. what do you think? OH The best time to watch it is when you are sick at home from school or even from the old office. It will make you feel great. I'm barely sick at home, but I still know it will make you feel better. For anyone who believes that the offer is stupid, this is very bad for you because you will not get the most out of your life even if you are happy with your life. You should really watch it and you will get hooked on it. I just tell you what happened to me and everyone who started watching this wonderful show. Well I need to go to eat some lunch. Remember that you should start watching a whole house and soon!
