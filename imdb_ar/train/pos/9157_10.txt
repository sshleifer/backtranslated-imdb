Jane Eyre was always my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this version of the film in the late 1990s, I was active! This is the best and most complete version of the book on the film! This version is a bit long to sit in one session but worth it. Timothy Dalton is as amazing as Rochester. I was happy because they acted as natural actors (Zilla Clark) as a gin and not as a charming character. I love the kits and the location. For anyone who likes Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch !!! For those of you who are interested, I found this version on a DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost crashed until, so I was thrilled to find it on a DVD.
