The story will never win prizes, but that's not what it's about ... The script was entertaining and disturbing enough to make room for incredibly amazing scenes of fighting. Who needs a story with such a fight? Really, it is worth watching for this reason alone. If you can handle Gore, of which there is so much ... none of them are done in a realistic enough way to be difficult to look at. I gave him 7.
