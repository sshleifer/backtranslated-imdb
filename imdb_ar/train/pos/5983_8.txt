I first saw this film as a teenager. It was at the time of the rule of heavy metals world. Trick Or Treat contains every element of a movie that shakes. With a cast including Scippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as Khatib, how can you make a mistake? Back evil letters played on vinyl! Yes that's right, they use the records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skype) listens to a message from the evil rock star on a player's record when things start to panic. Monsters begin to exit the speakers and become stereo. When I was a teenager, I tried to run my records back in the hope that it would happen to me. Nearly 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite films.
