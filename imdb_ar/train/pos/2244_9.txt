The only explanation I can get about why this film is not widely distributed is that it is very close to home for some. This movie was a real happy surprise, satire is a genius. This film shines the lights in the dark which is the organized religion and large media, cockroaches speed up the lid. If you have not already done so, this movie succeeds where many (the mind comes to mind) fail to broadcast it from under the tent, using humor and very smart sculptures as well as narrative backgrounds and sites. You can not comment in depth without revealing some important spoilers, there are some surprises in this film, which will be surprised by the film until the veteran.
