Did anyone notice that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when the wife of Hagarti reveals that she is pregnant while in the restaurant next to the lake. You watched this movie on a video you recorded from your TV. When I saw this scene I thought I realized Jones's voice when the waiter finally laughed. I rewound the tape and then slowly skipped through that part while the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen closely as the waiter laughs when Hagarti searches and tells him he will have a child, then closely watch or slow the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit quickly.
