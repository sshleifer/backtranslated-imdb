I appreciate movies like this: smart, well-designed, entertaining, well-stocked, well-represented and well-directed. No one - even the Pacino - chews the scene *, tries to stand out. One of the most effective moments in the film (pulling Aylo in the beloved slope) is chilling precisely because of its tuning. <br /> <br /> Involving the mind as well as eye, ear and heart. Why this type of entertainment is fluttered at the box office of anyone. <br /> <br /> * As you know, Pacheco chews it in one particular scene, but specifically because it is needed. Wonderful scenery too.
