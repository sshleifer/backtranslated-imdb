Takashi Miki's incursion into the territory of Kiddie won me almost immediately because he showed nerve and courage in dealing with elements of imagination. This fairy story dare to be dark. Even when I was a kid, I thought there was something wicked about most fairy tales. Horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike realizes that these classic stories are more disturbing (and more disturbing) than they seem at first glance. The director takes the model story of the child in an extraordinary endeavor outside the classroom. It highlights the very real fears of a world of endless and dangerous tasks. Westerners like to underestimate the seriousness of sleep stories written specifically for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. Goes to holiness of the story but it also shows signs of curbing. But the self-owned Miike is still a stranger to most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie to be strongly recommended.
