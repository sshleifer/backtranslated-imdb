The story and characters were the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for PS system and the tracks were cut and the sound amounts were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. I felt that the problems encountered by the protagonist were reasonable and realistic and I think they deserve a supplement. Or at least a new edition. If they rewrite the PS3, I will buy the system for that game only, and maybe mgs4 it's also amazing, the idea and implementation of the Dragoon system are enough to guarantee the rental and on top of that innovative ad though sometimes cheat stick) specific.
