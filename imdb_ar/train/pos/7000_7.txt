When I first saw the title I was already concluding the subject of the film - obviously it was not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespeare and about a pound of meat - take them, or give them. Will Smith is a good actor, so killers were hackers out. It can only be about a man giving them, so it must be about guilt in one way or another. I spoiled it myself by looking for it and knowing the story before I see it, because the beauty of the compositions is the way parts of the main character's background are fed to slowly illuminate the audience about who he is and why he is doing what he does. <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult subject to be done just because it is uncomfortable and very sad, and this is not an encouraging hypothesis when you are hoping to ride a roller coaster - you know it will be unpleasant. I will not say that the film glorifies suicide; it becomes the most extreme forms of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also full of symbolism everywhere, a wise sign that the writing is intelligently thought out, wonderful details, driving multiple meanings and deeply reflecting nature. The most prominent theme that surprised me was that he not only gave his heart to the girl he loved emotionally and metaphorically, but gave her physically as the greatest gift he could do. Determined to die, but his plan frustrated by falling in love - what a second complication. Completely ingenious. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I have not decided yet whether it is better to set it in a smaller time frame. I did not feel as much trouble and inner turmoil as I could, but maybe that's what I told myself. To say it all, it is a deeply influential original film, a very powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the rewards it will inevitably receive.
