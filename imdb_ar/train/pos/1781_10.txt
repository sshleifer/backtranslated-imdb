Here comes the Romeo section to change the model. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was on high alert in this short film. I saw him randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I thanked God every day since then. I really think I was part of an event, like reading the text of Tarantino before any other event or watching the street show Mean St.. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival is going short to next or what the creative team has to take advantage of future products, but I hope to be there for that. <br /> <br /> Once again, a wonderful piece of filmmaking.
