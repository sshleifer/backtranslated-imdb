I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to know if Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Louis Rainer deserves her Oscar. I came from the movie thinking Yeah! After watching Moni in just one film where he was very beaty, I was expecting the same performance here. I have happily proved wrong. Although some may criticize him as childish and quite simple in Hollywood's idea of ​​Asians, I thought he was right in this role. Keye Luke, if given the opportunity to play a leading role, may have played the same way. <br /> <br /> I was especially impressed with the work of the camera and the use of audience scenes, especially during the separation of the palace where O-Lan was a slave. The painting and gloating atmosphere of the shooting and drought team made this epic quite different from the others at the same time as everything was wonderful and brilliant. I watched this movie from start to finish fascinated. I can not say the same about "Epic" today.
