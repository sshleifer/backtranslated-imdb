Answer: Despite the fact that this film is composed and directed by a woman, your former wife is creeping, sinister, and more rational than any coma ever was. <br /> <br /> The representation in this already independent film is very good, although the script is less than fantastic. It takes a good representative to present a line of written cliches and make them look ambiguous. The young man Anthony de Marco, as Jake, performs particularly well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this movie is much better than dialogue. Try it, especially if you are not a fan of monsters. This is not a horror flick. Although all adult females are largely geriatric, and although all adult males act as if their brains had been addressed in a previous zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for mature adults. <br /> <br /> All this time is much better than the sum of its parts.
