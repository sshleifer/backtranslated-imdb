Anyone interested in pop music, not familiar with British music trends in the late 1970s, should make sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, about the quest of a young woman to make her mark in the world of music, captures the times completely from overt sexual discrimination, difficult economic times, and social unrest, to a shift in pop culture from evil to evil to the terrible villain and to the future / new romance. The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late 1970s are still being rediscovered and recycled (there has been nothing new since 1980). Breaking Glass is a very personal story, explores the cultural scene, and is very good.
