I saw this previous scene by accident, I've seen it twice now. I enjoyed it completely. There were no silly messages, just good fun, good songs, good characters, and a very good film. I highly recommend it to those who like to enjoy movies and not to dissect them. Here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very strong. Songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really fun to listen to Jason Alexander and take advantage of your feet in complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman ans. Tyne Dali still clings to my mind from Kani and Lacey and her voice and her accent still remember her. Overall I just loved it and would look forward to buying it if available
