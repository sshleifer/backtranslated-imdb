The plot is really terrible, the atmosphere really depressing, and the unusual to produce a low budget like this, at least, for German production. A little bit of Indian spirituality, mystical excitement and mixed italian film together. The plot development and characters are wonderful, very close sets of reality, without any studio atmosphere. This may be ideal, but unfortunately some things were somewhat disappointing, which should not normally be for low-budget films: <br /> <br /> 1. Sometimes the cast is not more than average. Almost every actor looks like an ordinary person. Some of them do good or very good work, but some act like actors in the crazy German court performances! But I was very disappointed by the representation of Matthew Carrier! His acting (in many of his old films was acting well) was below average here! But that may be why he is involved today in a crazy German soap or television series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues are sometimes opera-level. <br /> <br /> 3.) Making bad sound is very difficult Sometimes you understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was happy to rewind and listen to it again. Caused by the group (large halls as in the hospital or with the underground group) and sometimes strange dialects of representatives! <br /> <br /> But in general, it's an interesting film, worth watching, far beyond commercial films, which are often more horrific.
