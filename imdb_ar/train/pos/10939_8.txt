The Five Deadly Venoms is a wonderful action film of Kung Fu wrapped in the whununnit puzzle. There are all the usual signs of feng shui kung fu: brilliant choreography, horrific dubbing, various fighting styles, and a wide range of highly exaggerated and often cheesy human feelings. However the plot is definitely better than average. It is interesting and draws your attention through non-combat scenes. Sometimes, it can make the public angry, as it does when X receives a terrible character. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about The Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the film's ethics and themes. Almost everyone gets what will come to them. Cowardly and greedy and corrupt are losing. The wicked, consumed by selfish greed, are ultimately destroyed by treachery and stabbing. Good people use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome difficulties and get to the top. <br /> <br /> Toxic rocks clan!
