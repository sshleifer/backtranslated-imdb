This was the first feature of Keaton and is actually three shorts, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) on the eternal triangle of romance. Stories parallel each other as in Griffith's intolerance, which was intended as satire. The power points of jokes and pennies are almost based on historical paradoxes, making modern business in old environments. <br /> <br /> **** Warning - spoilers follow to clarify the best points ****** <br /> <br /> Here are some classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using the turtle as an oasis (Roman era); using a helmet as a tire lock (Roman era); early golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); dictation of the will Being carved in a rock (Stone Age); predictor of changing weather (Roman era); race carriages in snow - using skis and husks with a dog reserve in box trolleys (Roman era). <br /> <br /> All of the above is a disposable gloom that keeps us funny. However, there are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> The buster sets up the razor to match the girl who puts on the make-up; takes the wonderful multiplier when the bittersweet baker looks at his bowl to discover the lobster staring at him (within a second he jumped to stand on his chair) From the sitting position and then jumped back into the bosom of the waiter - one of the funniest moments I have ever seen) and this lion - the manicure - is just wonderful. <br /> <br /> There is also a kind of racism when four of the African-American garbage-throwers abandon their mistress in a Roman nonsense game. <br /> <br /> The keno print is somewhat vague and contains several sequences of nitrate degradation and film damage - most likely at the ends of the rollers. Metro feature with piano, flute and borrowers was recorded significantly from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and lots of laughs.
