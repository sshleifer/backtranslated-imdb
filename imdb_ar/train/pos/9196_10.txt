Kimi wa petto is a nice story about a girl who once found a boy inside a box outside her apartment one day. I decided to bring him up and fix his wounds. Then leave a note for him to eat some of the food I gave and then go home because she had to go to work. When you get home you find it is still there. He tells her that he wants to live with her like a brother or a cousin. In a desperate attempt to get him to leave, tell him that if he becomes an animal he can survive. As a pet you say you will not have any rights and do what you tell them. (Not that way!) And to surprise, he agrees and is known as Momo, her pet.
