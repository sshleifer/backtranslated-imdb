I must say, I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Scenario and representation is very good. The manager also did a good job. Although some scenes look a little clumsy, it's generally a good movie. The idea was certainly wonderful and the truth did not reveal itself until the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital was well given. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it somewhat boring because the story line is very focused and takes their time to develop their character and story. The ethics of the story, it is a decent film of its kind is surprisingly good.
