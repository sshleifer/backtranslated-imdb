I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film filmed at a site in Alaska. Although melodrama technically, we see many activities in which Eskimos participate, such as hunting, dancing, kabbani building, etc., and their habits, such as presenting their wives to visitors, are usually in the story routinely. The fishing sequence was sometimes of stock footage, because it was easy to identify some of the rear projection scenes of the animals, but even these were fantastic. I have made fishing spear for salmon, looking for rude, caribou, even polar bear and whale, it looks like a documentary film sometimes. There was no cast list, which enhanced the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to make it seem very authentic, with native speakers speaking only Esquimos translated by someone on screen or by translation. The introduction stated that except for white traders and the Royal Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not entirely true. The protagonists, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were the Eskimos by birth, but they were professional actors with credits for previous films and could sometimes see them. But they were excellent in their roles and continued to get jobs in Hollywood. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a look.
