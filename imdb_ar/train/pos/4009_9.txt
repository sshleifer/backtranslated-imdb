Children - of any age - do not want to know about the life of their parents. Older children are often seriously perplexed and have no evidence that elderly parents have active sexual desire. Finally, many filmgoers are not too comfortable to watch an illiterate widow who passes unnoticed and almost discovers her painful ability and needs a passionate passion with a handsome man half her age. <br /> <br /> "Mother" a provocative look at the fact was barely photographed - a woman unwilling to stay at home, watching the "short", the vegetation after her husband for nearly three decades, separated controlled dominant in it, Quietly a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Mai (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, both of whom are dysfunctional in their own way. The male son lives with a beautiful wife who may lead him to the bankruptcy court through her high-profile business. Paula (Katharine Bradshaw), is a school with ambitions to succeed as a writer. She's attractive and not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with my mom - at first. <br /> <br /> She returned home after her husband was buried, so I decided not to stay there. She refused typical widowhood with her legacy of boring days and not adventurous, and goes to stay with Paula who has a young son. Her boyfriend Paula, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a handsome and violent contractor and seems to be taking a horribly long time to complete an addition to the son of May. The month of May was completely taken up with Darin, who drinks wine and inhales coke, which should be his warning to Paula. May have been warned that he is definitely a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Cadas. <br /> <br /> The following is an affair between Darren and the besieged widow and now alive. Love scenes are drawings but they are second in drawing the artist's drawings and the pen for Mayan amateurs in their experiences and then play a role in the heinous drama (or defeat, pick up your favorite photos). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was packed early in the afternoon showing up with more than half of the audience in the May lifetime range. The shock or discomfort of some people to see it abandon itself by abandoning its sex in the arms of a younger man is an understatement. <br /> <br /> This deadly frank view of the awakened emotion of old women after decades of absolute obedience to her husband's desire to stay home and raise children (also remember he did not like her to have friends - man) surfaces a number of issues. Although May's condemnation of Darren does not constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions and problems, with the mother's mattress for her daughter's lover. Paula is not made of the most rudimentary things. This case, which has been revealed, offers an opening to the relationship between mother and daughter, which, from Paula's point of view, left something to be desired. Mrs. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants to support her mother as well as her love - she has not received a terrible hand of life but it is not roses either. <br /> <br /> Mai is strong in her determination to recognize her sexuality and anticipate the future of happiness. But also vulnerable to inevitable. It's caught in an unknown emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why it is difficult for her to understand, not solve. In her 60s, is still in progress. <br /> <br /> "Give Something" showed something mature recently, but in a comforting, comforting way, saying it would not upset any viewer. After all, Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are always beautiful in the world of the wealthy. To ensure that no serious psycho-social problems are detected, Keaton's little friend, Amanda Pitt, Keaton's daughter, is not only blessed with the game, but ensures that the public knows that she and her old lover will never move to a bag. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to get out here. The inspirational performance of Anne Reed is disturbing to some while being respected by others. Her naked body explodes with sexual life for some and seems absurd as an object to attract the physical to others (comments from members of the departing public today reflect all these views). <br /> <br /> Kudos directed by Roger Michel to deal with a fascinating story with puzzlement and sympathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
