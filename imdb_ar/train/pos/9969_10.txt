Shoshank, godfather, fantasy core ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, I do not mean anything until you live up to the greatest Christmas movies ever, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is very cool and has many messages, and I cry while watching it. Seriously, this is one of the movies you need to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch is told that he will have to eat ice cream, we see grief in his eyes, and we feel very sad, and then wonder ... What is the very bad thing about this ice cream? Do you imply that as humans we treat ice cream as good when all we do is evil? Think Makes You Think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best performance from Santa Claus at all. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him jailing children and spying on children's dreams and wondering. Does Santa truly believe in this goodness? Also, remember Santa's Christ, the full meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe yourself to watching this movie masterpiece. We must stop just making films and broadcasting anything but this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Whoever says this movie is bad is a foolish fool.
