Do not mind the soundtrack, which is now playing. <br /> <br /> However, the Debra Winger is always interesting, and although this was an early role for her, she is very good like Cissy, the wrong girl side of the tracks, lived in a trailer with Bud, (Travolta) Only to be replaced by Madlyn Smith for a while, as a competitor. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review regarding Scott Glenn, used for the scheme only, thrown into the mix to create suspense; the story is predictable and contradictory. <br /> <br /> Also, although I am from the East, many of us did not like the "Saturday Night Fever" fever, while there were moments, the stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point. <br /> <br /> Debra Wenger deserves to be seen; she is still very fond, and she has never been exposed to the Hollywood character we are subjected to by many actresses today. 10/07
