Just when I saw Napoleon Dynamite I remembered seeing the Cracker Bag. Just a nice feeling and yet do not stoop to being dirty. There are some wonderful cinematic works and the leading girl is very impressive. It captures more than craving time. She has a real heart to it. It is the wounds of childhood Achilles which is wonderful and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. Glendyn Ivin enjoys a great future and I am one, looking for his next project. Follow-up is always the hardest thing. It's like a second album blues for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope that his next film is not as lame as the movie Shark. Cheers for everyone. Enjoy the cinema
