Definitely one of the lesser musical works in Astaire / Rogers. It's just a very bad pace and pace. It only works for a few minutes longer than the swing time, for example, but it feels worse for a longer time. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Rarely interesting Scott ever. I love Hilliard. She is sweet, and I love one of her songs at least, "But where are you?" ("Get thee the Devil's Back", her other digit, is the weak remains of Top Hat, and fortunately they were cut off from that masterpiece). The Fleet may actually be a bad film if not for at least three great dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance contest competes for first place in any of its numbers. The dance is just gorgeous. "I put all my eggs in one basket" showing the two are practicing a dance they have not completed yet. Its imperfections make it more perfect. And "Let's Face Music and Dance" is one of Berlin's best Irving songs. So the film deserves to see its wonderful moments.
