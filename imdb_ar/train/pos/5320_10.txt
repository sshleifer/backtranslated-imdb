I'm starting to watch this film. I do not expect anything, just another film I watch, but since the first 20 minutes, the main, mysterious and mysterious artwork, I do not really have much in this film. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film, it was dark and behaved beautifully and really touched. It is a bit slow but the immersion was complete. The output was wonderful by telling us the bits of the story that led to Joe's conviction and his life behind the bars. The music was really fantastic and was well integrated into the sights. The end was unexpected with a twist I did not see coming. It's not the kind of film we see so much.
