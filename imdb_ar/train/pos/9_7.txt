The romantic drama of the working class by Martin Reit is not as incredible as it comes, but there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of the stars Jean Fonda and Robert de Niro (both are gorgeous). She is a widow who can not move forward; she is illiterate and a closet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. The composition of the novel "Union Street" is somewhat relaxed, as the film's release is chaotic, but it's still fun; There are no offers for serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a conspiracy tool for the love story that followed) and there are no real fireworks, although the characters are somewhat colorless and the threads are reduced to an interesting degree. The end is a pure fluff - and the pessimists will find it difficult to swallow - although these two people deserve a happy ending and the picture will not be really satisfactory any other way. *** from ****
