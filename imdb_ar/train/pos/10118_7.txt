I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this movie that I saw about two years ago, and is already watching my head. Never before have such a sick and twisted thing. The story is good and the actors do their job very well. I have not seen the UK or Japan version, but I must say that I think the German DVD is slightly censored. If you have not already seen the movie and live in Germany, it is best to look for a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. I-ON DVD contains a lot of harsh and bad scenes, but in the confrontation I felt that something was missing, related to one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in every well-delusional film with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what Miike likes to !!
