A matter of life or death, what can you really say that would correct the genius and beauty of this film correctly. The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger does not define boundaries, each frame is full of fantastically bold compositions. Switching from the bold colors of the "real world" to the glowing black and white of the sky is creative and visually shows us the most vital life. The final court scene is also wonderful, as the judge and the jury descend to the ladder to judge the process of Peter (David Neven). <br /> <br /> All the shows are on display (Roger Levisi is prominent), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there was no more romantic film (if I had a haven I saw.) The issue of life and death revolves around the power of love Jack Cardiff's film industry is enough to see the film on its own, and the way Kim Hunter's face makes it more beautiful, he's a genius, he can make simple things like table tennis look exciting. The way in which the sound is mute in the vital points is the decision-making method before its time A real classic can regain the faith of any person cinema, under appreciation in the initial release and through the fans today, but all you prefer all the time, and this is why I give this movie 10/10, the word - beautiful.
