The double exposure was a huge surprise. It contains an outstanding representation (especially from the understated Calan), beautiful cinema and a compelling story. In other words, it is one of the finest horror efforts of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Kallan plays a fashion photographer who tries to kill his protagonists, while meeting his psychologically troubled brother (who happens to be missing arm and leg). When the mannequins dream of the actual killing, the photographer starts questioning his mind ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie has never received praise it deserves. Most critics and film directors come together with a bunch of curly films being released at the same time, but they outperform the bulk of this unfortunate collection. It's smart and unique, something you can not comfortably say about most of the movies of this genre, but it's also been set up and released enthusiastically. Double exposed jewel of its kind.
