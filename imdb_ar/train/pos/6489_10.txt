I watched this series when I first came out in my seventies. I was 14 years old and saw her in my best friends at home because my father did not want to see her. It has become a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as anyone who tells you for two years at the age of 14 to watch a documentary in almost rough silence should mean that this was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide sweep of World War II makes it difficult to document. The manufacturers divided them into what they considered the most important events and devoted one episode to each. Some episodes have covered long periods like the "wolf pack" that covered nearly six years of the Battle of the Atlantic. Stalingrad had one ring for himself. <br /> <br /> This documentary can not be made today simply because most of those interviewed have died. The list of important players who appear gives an amazing look at thinking at the time. Anthony Eden, Secretary of State, Carl Donitz, H in front of the U boats, Albert Spier, a confident pet engineer and later minister of armaments to Hitler. In one of the subsequent episodes we saw Traudl Ging, the secretary of Hitler, who was with him in the bunker and who was dictated by the last will and testimony - left the hideout after the suicide of Hitler and fled through the Russian lines. These and many others play a key role in the reality of the events filmed. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series is that the bletchly codes are not included, but their part of the war was not revealed until after the series was produced, so I can not blame the Program makers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles and music are great, and Laurence Olivier's novel adds great risk to the script. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? No doubt. Not acceptable
