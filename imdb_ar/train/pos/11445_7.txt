A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers & Tides allows fans to see their work moving. Watch Goldsworthy make a piece, develop one's appreciation for each stone and leaves and fork used. Goldsworth describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire his work. Although I was happy because the film covered the majority of the Goldsworthy pieces (not snowballs), I felt that they were a bit long. The filmmakers did a great job restoring Goldsworthy's work, creating a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
