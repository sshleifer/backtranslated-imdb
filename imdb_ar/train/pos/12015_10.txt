At first this film was your typical western film, however, it was very interesting and kept me so grand to the end, which turned out to be extraordinary. Charlton Heston (Sam Burger), Midway, 76, has previous experiences with James Coburn, Zack Provo, Didful, 93, and Zack never forgives Sam and will not stop at anything to make sure he hangs with him and pays him back. Other. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgad), "Portrait of a Lady", "96", succeeded in falling into this situation and found herself among sex-hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions and was quite surprised by the result. This is a very interesting movie and the acting was great.
