Dan Katzir produced a wonderful film that takes us on a journey aboard a warship through a true love story about the problems surrounding modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has been in love at all, the film reproduces the uncertainty, insecurity and heartache that makes love resolve. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came in the difficult times in Israel at that time only served to intensify the feeling. Immediately, she is attracted to the plight of Dan, and can not fail to be deeply affected. <br /> <br /> You can not write drama and passion like this - the contrast between desperate desperation facts Dan and kidnapped relationship with the iris, and the state realities in turmoil make this a prominent sight. If you have an ounce of passion, you're in love ever, check out this movie.
