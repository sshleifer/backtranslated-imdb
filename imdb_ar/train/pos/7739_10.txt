Have you read Jim Thompson? It is Noir boiled with the utmost extremism and cruelty I have ever faced. Rarely are there private investigators in his work - just losers, psychotropic and young con artists. Thompson allowed this film - "If God made any real mistakes in this world, it would give us a will to live when we have no excuse for it." Every character in the film is balanced on the edge of the code between false realism and realism. There are drowsy and irritating buds, played by Bruce Dern and the well-meaning Dick Goldman of George Dickerson. Jason Patrick presents a wonderful and often painful show like Kid Collins, a shy former fighter who is fearless and afraid of himself more than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Faye, the sexy femme that we can not discover ... it's not your usual movie, nor is it. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
