Although I thought at one point that this would turn into a graduate, I must say that the mother does an excellent job explaining the sexual desires of an elderly woman. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy that this is a British film because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they had, they would have destroyed it by not spending time developing personalities. <br /> <br /> The story is slowly and realistically revealed. Representation is wonderful, characters are reasonably flawed, dialogue is delicate. I tried several times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I felt the intense interest of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie. I must admit, I will look at my mother forever in a different light!
