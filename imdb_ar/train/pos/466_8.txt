This was a very good historical drama. John Tortoro is considered as excellent as the genius of the tormented Lozin and brilliantly depicts the manic influences of personality such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her supportive role as Natalia's sensitive lover. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and madness is closely explored by Boris and the familiar Nabokov concerns such as "eternal innocence" (ie, "Lolita") are evident in this film. I think I'll go now to read the novel. The end was painful and tragic and it was difficult to maintain eye dryness. Wonderful movie!
