This film has been so well done on so many levels that I am so terrified that the score is low (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at this writing). This film contains incredible special effects, a true epic story, a complex interaction of great characters, and battles on the mind - must be seen as incredible! The only complaint I have is the translation on the HK version I got (some lines are not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I do not understand when I read and hear from different sources: "Contains a confusing plot ....", "I could not follow the story ...." or "Characters came out of nowhere ...". Since the first time I saw this film, I understood and followed it and I knew why there were characters, and I absolutely loved it! I've seen it already about 8 times, and every time this is a great treat. This is not just my opinion, because I have shown this film to many Americans (people who have never seen a movie before from Hong Kong before) and who feel the same way. None of them succeeded in following the story and everyone declared his love for the film. Hey man, why can not we get things like these coming out of Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings was a cute marriage of special effects, character development, and story. <br /> <br /> This does not come from a novice lover in an Asian movie too. I own a vast library of Asian movies and I must say that this movie is one of the greatest DVDs. When you watch it, you'll miss the wonderful special effects and epic feeling of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantastic world and will not want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 and 2001 versions (both done by Tsui Hark), and 2001 are much better than the IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the translation, I have one additional complaint about this film: I did not want to end up .... I beg you Mr. Hark - Can we have a supplement?
