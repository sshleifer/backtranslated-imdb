Ideal films are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have flaws - the "back window" seems a bit small at times, Chris Elliott's character does not work on Ground Day, so the music score in "Our Best Years of Life" is very cheesy, the nights of Cabiria are a bit too slow - But this film is completely executed from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The script is awesome, the acting is awesome everywhere (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Whitstone are amazing, cast all the actors), the output is inspired photography, the degree of music touches without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores) Are very manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every light moment makes me smile. This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen and I wish there would be more movies like her. <br /> <br /> I am happy that Reese Witherspoon has continued to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent films have become calmer and more ridiculous than this serious film about real people, real feelings and real problems. brilliant! Must see.
