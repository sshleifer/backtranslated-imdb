"Garden of God" was one of the first long-length technololor films. To correct the previous poster, Technicolor's first feature (after the exclusive 5-year Disney deal) was "Becky Sharp" in 1935 which was a fashion drama that used color to suit its colorful fashion. <br /> <br /> God "looks as if it could have been filmed years later because cinematography not only uses color, but also uses shadow." It should be great for the audience at the time to see the color feature after watching black and white movies Unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinema, however, the film is worth seeing as an optical therapy.
