Despite its low release in this country, it is clearly ignored in other countries (the 'R' rating in the US can not help - frankly, just because HBC uses the word C!), This is actually a good piece of work. Emotions sometimes threaten to suffocate, but are overcome by playing two horses. (Daniel Day Lewis, Jeffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham Carter, may not fully demonstrate the physical deterioration of the MND, but Its emotional power extends to the maximum and does not fully compensate. In fact, almost all of her performance is performed through her eyes (and what eyes!). This clever turn of actress quickly deflects her reputation in English from Rose, and stands out as a character of some kind. The awards must certainly follow, but not unfortunately, for this good performance. <br /> <br /> One feels, Branagh, never offered his best at all in the film (except perhaps "Hamlet", and there his game dwindles because of a large cast). Here, however, he tops his other apparitions, and plays quite a person who hates himself, unstable, lovable in the end with a precision he has not always displayed, showing intelligence and depth. In short, we believe in him, just as we could not believe him like Frankenstein, like the priest in The Proposition, as a lawyer in The Gingerbread Man, even with Andrew in Peter's Friends. This is certainly his best performance so far - why could not he produce the goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a television show, and without its stars, it may not reach very much. But it was a pleasure to see this pair pulling out their drawers like this, and I eagerly wait for more of them (although it is not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Prang and HBC get 10 out of 10.
