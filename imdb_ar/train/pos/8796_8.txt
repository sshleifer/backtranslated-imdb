<br /> <br /> It seems that everything relative is the main theme from the beginning through this eleven-piece set by eleven exit. This means that what may be the number one priority of people like Bush, Blair and Co. may not be so for many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene where the Iranian teacher is trying to convince her young students about the most important thing that happened, and the result is that the children were not impressed, as the death of a neighbor and things like this affect them more clearly. From anything that may happen in New York, USA, wherever it is, this series of almost documentary pieces proves that not all things are equal with all men as some world leaders try to predict. <br /> <br /> While it is clear that the attack on the World Trade Center was a terrible event by any standard, one has the impression that politicians and television photographers tend to blow things out of everything - this is beautifully illustrated by these pieces . Would the same reaction have taken place at the international level if the attack had taken place in Lagos, for example, in Jakarta, or even in Rio de Janeiro, for example? I do not think so. News seems to suffer from distortion depending on where things happen: for example, a larger television time for an earthquake in Italy is given, for example, more than ten times the destruction in Outer Mongolia, for example. Larger distances seem to reduce the scale of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This eleven-piece series helps to put things in a better perspective - or perhaps I should say, some pieces do, since each director has complete freedom to create his own story and translate it so that It is not possible to judge all the benefits, but individually for each slice of 11 minutes. <br /> <br /> No one should conclude that this is an anti-American film: it would be a very simple reading of the various messages that appear through the slides. However, they are not pro-US. The 11 sectors adopt diverse positions and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the World Trade Center attack must be seen from a different perspective. Only then will people like George Bush begin to understand the planet on which he lives. <br /> <br /> Clearly, in one part I believe that I have been harboring him for two years now: America has not learned the lesson. The lesson is that the United States of America must share this planet with the rest of humanity - not control it through harsh economic persuasion or simple power. Instead of learning that the United States of America can not continue to seal everywhere and everywhere, its political leaders, with the help and encouragement of Blair (and even Aznar), have become more arrogant and more fanatic, which does not benefit anyone in Afghanistan. Or Iraq at the present time, let alone anywhere else. The White House mentality is utterly unacceptable: The United States and the United Kingdom have invaded Iran and caused all the chaos, so it must remove the chaos it has caused - not insist on the United Nations and other nations to get in the way and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil. <br /> <br /> The radical positions espoused by the United States (or even Israel) will be met only by extreme positions of the Islamists, who for years have been preparing for fanatical fundamentalism, if only to cover up their own mascot useless, stoning women to death or Simply wrap them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of some rich countries that seem determined not to see or understand anything from multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately depicts this dreary and mute attitude.
