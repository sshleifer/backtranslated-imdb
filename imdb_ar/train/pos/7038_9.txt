"The first war to be 100% outsourcing." Dan Akroyd's line says it all. This is difficult to describe the film. Comedy, spelling, action, curled. We mentioned once or twice to Dr. Strangelov, especially in the scenes that show Ben Kingsley (who did a wonderful job I think). I had no expectations for this film, although I admire John John Kozak, so just let the movie overwhelm me. As a result I was entertained. The political cynicism is accurate and utterly painful to the American military complex. The sub plots were somewhat predictable, but the final entanglement of the lines of the story made them worthwhile. I can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the United States, but for the rest of the world, it's a story in time.
