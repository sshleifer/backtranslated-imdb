Clean film for families. I laughed, cried ... I loved him. I was worried that I would not be able to see Steve Karel as anything other than a maddened Michael from the office. Boy, I was wrong. He must win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on a DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and it is not in films of this kind. I saw him with two other couples in the age group of 30 years and we all agreed that it was the best film we've seen in a long time and definitely the cleanest. Just 1 word cuss! I'm not sure why PG13 was. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
