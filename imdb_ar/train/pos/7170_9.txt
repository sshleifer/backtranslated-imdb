HOLES is not your Disney theme - it's very fun, even for adults who usually swing in the gentle family-inspired "family entertainment" that the Walt Walt Studio sees as a live movement. Perhaps the secret to the success of this film lies in its loyalty to the original book, which is a little darker than your child's middle purposes. The procedure begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to the boys' prison camp, forcing all inmates to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehabilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story becomes intertwined with a legendary treasure story, and this adventure is 10 times more fun than any Disney movie about a prison camp for all the boys. John Voight is particularly bad and colorful, and Segorny Weaver is beautiful, as always.
