Moon Child, who starred Japanese rockers Hyde and Jackett, was a better film then I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is in Mallepa, and the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Shinoji's brother, and Toshi, who steal and kill to earn a living. In one of the burglaries, Shaw encountered a vampire hides to burn in the sunlight. Through the difficult events, the true nature appears to be, but no one moves away from it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and means that the immortal Kei that never changed raised Sho, and that both have a very big influence. Close link. Then Sho and Kei Jr. are caught in a battle with outrageous weapons, and become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde are in love with Sister Son, Yi Chi. <br /> <br /> Time skips ahead of us again and shows Sho grew, this time void of Kei. It also shows that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy that followed the tragedy, this film turns into reality and all the difficulties it faces, with a focus on friendship and love. It's a really touching but sad film at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Jack did a great job. Hyde did a great job for the first time. <br /> <br /> The footage was beautiful, but the film had very rare and short footage. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say this film is stunning, moving, and I highly recommend it.
