My roommate asked this out of the web for a while and finally managed to see it. It's gross. It's cheesy. She is very stupid ... but she is also a lot of fun. I mean, this was the most fun we've seen in a movie like this since "City Of The Walking Dead" since ages. It was as if I were in the old Drive-In theater again! Can you tell the person who made this movie about all the scary zombie movies? This one has all the cliches and tricks of those movies that have been integrated into one, which is neat because it's supposed to be like this. The cheesecake is high, as the gorges flow and wolf laughs! The effects go from dirty to good, with the effect of ripping the man in half and the one in which the heart beats through his chest. Representation acting from terrible to good already. There is not much plot, just a lot and lots of gore. This pattern is patterned with zombie films from Italy and Spain, because they continue to watch them forever, such a film. If you like Troma movies and the fun stuff of category B, you can not see this movie wrong. A beautiful way to waste a Friday night!
