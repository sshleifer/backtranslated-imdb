Since this film is entirely Swiss, it is difficult for most German speakers to follow this film. I am not from Switzerland, but I worked there for several years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of films of this kind (for example, a scary movie, large amounts of spoof for Skivie etc) but this movie is the best of this kind, I've seen it so far. I give 9 of 10. The only reason I can not give the number is 10, because there are some small details that could have been done better and because they did not submit translations in any language on DVD, so there is almost no non-Swiss chance to understand.
