This is a wonderful musician of a lifetime by one of my favorite composers, Gershwin and a nice "Parisian" atmosphere that gives the film a lot of magic, but in terms of the story. Well, there is not really. Or at least, not good. Representation is also not smooth by Karon. But I liked some of the dialogues, and I liked the scene in China, I liked the character Levent played, the colors; the dancing of course, which is very wonderful. <br /> <br /> It seems to me 7.5-8 on the point for me.
