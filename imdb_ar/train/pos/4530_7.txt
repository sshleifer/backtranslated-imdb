D.W. Griffith could produce any film he wanted after the huge financial success of "The Birth of a Nation"; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to date, "fanaticism". He risked such innovations in film editing and format, leading to the wreckage of the well-known financial train. Buster Keaton does not take this kind of risk with the "Three Ages" or a parody of "fanaticism". This is his first feature film Keaton (he acted only in "Saphead"). He had a spare plan to split the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts, which Griffith did with "fanaticism". Keaton do not have to. Chaplin has already been successful in long comedy films, so if Keaton risks here, he has been counted in full. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has already done a parody of another film, Burlesque on Carmen (1915). Keaton seems to be hinting at this film. The wrestling scene in the ancient Rome episode refers to the battle of Swords that turns into a wrestling match in Chaplin. The comedy distance of the plot of both scenes is the same too. In addition, Chaplin imitated the brilliant style of "Carmen" for Demille, and Chaplin's film appears to be a tribute to this film. Keaton does not attempt radical editing, narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody, but he seems to respect "fanaticism". At least, the stories are not just as in post-"fanaticism" films, such as Dreyer's "Leaves from Satan's Book" (Blade af Satans bog, 1921) and Fritz Lang's 'Destiny' (Der MÃ¼de Tod, 1921). There are some slight jumps between the rings. <br /> <br /> However, Keaton has been at risk, but in a bold physical comedy. This is Keaton's failure to inadvertently jump into buildings in the modern ring. He was reportedly convinced to change the scene instead of trying to jump again. It was not only Keaton who bore the risks; for example, the outdated baseball hoop was fairly dangerous. Thus, although Keaton, in another way, like Griffith, he risked his big film. I think they succeeded.
