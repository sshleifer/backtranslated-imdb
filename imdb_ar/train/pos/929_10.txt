Father of Pride was the best new TV show since Family Guy. Another masterpiece was the talented at Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show focuses on a nuclear family (from white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters including the mysterious Orangutan Roger, Vincent Flamengo Italian American, the whimsical White Tigers Blake and Victoria, the supernatural Brothers and superheroes, and the Rocky Elephant. Other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a super way, making most mundane activities amusing. A combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, bias, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. <br /> <br /> The reason for this show's failure is NBC. They chose to broadcast the episodes in any particular order (perhaps influenced by guest stars who can promote them) rather than the most logical production order. Several times, the show was pre-screened for an additional half hour from this tub like The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of it were not enough)! It's really a harbinger of TV's future as a shroud if such an original and bold display fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the full series was released on DVD and the show now has a chance to earn the next biggest. 10/10
