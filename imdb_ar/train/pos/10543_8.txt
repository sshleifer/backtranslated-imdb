A tepid comedy, nothing shows us a world we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you do not like, whether a pile of bills, bad memory or even hunger can disappear as you wish. They treated this film very well, and with a fun duo of starring, there were only a few things I did not like about Nothing, and were not even part of the main film. <br /> <br /> First, the post-appropriation scene (and yes, there's one): good for chuckle, but what were they trying to accomplish with that? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a movie full of nothing. Instead, we only hear a random set of noise as they scream. Trying to prepare a supplement in my opinion, it was not really necessary, and it was not funny after crawling out of the turtle outside the window. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I watched the trailer on DVD and, as others have already said, it is promoting a horror film that never came. Well, I think marketing is weak. <br /> <br /> If you see this in the movie rental store, take a look, because there's no great movie to watch. If you have a large screen, you may want to wear shades.
