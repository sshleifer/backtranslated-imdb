I saw this on the Cantonese VCD with an English translation. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subcontractors were acting excessively. Taking this away from the film as the musical result did somewhat lame, which really irritated me throughout the entire film. If the musical score is improved, I can overlook some excessive scenes. Then the film will be much better.
