Greetings back from darkness. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost spirit of men in pain. Adam Sandler plays the role of Charlie, the man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and has since lost his career, the cause of his life and the wrath of his mind. Don Cheadle takes part in the role of former room partner at the Sandler School of Dentistry who seems to have enjoyed the ideal life (which Sandler seems to have lived before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the similarities in the lives of these men are clear, but it is really refreshing to see the feelings of men displayed in the film ... other than feelings of lust and revenge. Watching how they help each other through being there is painful and hearty. The writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) really brings a different look to the film. Some scenes do not work with others, but are generally well written and strongly oriented. <br /> <br /> Both Sandler and Cheadle are excellent. Sandler's character recalls some of his outstanding performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a great job of expressing the burden he endures ... just by watching him work in a jigsaw puzzle. <br /> <br /> The support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (wife of Cheadle), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Savoron Burroughs (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as a raging judge, Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein in Sandler . <br /> <br /> The movie really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that it was fundamentally destroyed. In addition to the thriller and some wonderful shots of New York City, you have to love a movie featuring Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder, a Daltrey character. Not exactly a very optimistic film, but a good film with an extraordinary story.
