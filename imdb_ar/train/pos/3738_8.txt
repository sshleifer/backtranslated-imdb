TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, viewers have watched and understood war films with every possible point of view , And somehow producers and writers always come in new and innovative ways to portray the various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), one of the most dangerous directors currently working, has found a similarity to the "Red Red Line" in the new drama "Tigerland" in an individual soldier's shoe. This film, written by Ross Clavan and Michael McGotter, has more courage and irony than the "High Red Line" or even "Saving the Soldier Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film has been somewhat reduced by the perversion of the present material, it certainly illuminates a new perspective of youth training on war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really this shameless and brutal? I'm sure some of them, but the movie sees his relentless world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Booz (Colin Farrell), a rebel against the ideas of war. His character immediately confronts several other characters, one of whom becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davies), and another person, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fervent temper often provokes Bose's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war described in this production was not found in a battlefield, but on a training ground for a Louisiana-based educational camp between the concepts and fears of soldiers in training. This film is specifically about preparing for war, no more and no less. And end up when the soldiers finally go to war, and this is a kind of frustration because watching the characters at work was a rewarding reward. <br /> <br /> Images were taken on site within approximately 28 days using a 16 mm stock and a limited budget. Joel Schumacher accurately displays an attractive, oblique, ruthless, ruthless atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and audio Direct. Schumacher's beloved and interpreted photographs make the film look like a documentary film. This unusual method of filmmaking contributes only to the solid reality of the film, and it represents graphs in its use of coarse language, and perhaps very disturbing. Waves of four-letter words strike the audience, some in shock at what they hear. Even the maximum amount of vulgarity does not prevent the dialogue from reigning as a tragic, correct and emotional one. <br /> <br /> If anything, "Tigerland" gives us a small estimate of how much our troops have for us in the early stages of the fighting. Such courage must be required to enlist in the army in times of war, and to know the difficulties and risks that are borne. Such thought-provoking ideas are made possible by stunning performances by aspiring young actors portraying different trainees. This film is not for all viewers, but it is a film that young people should take a look at before recruiting themselves into the army ... adults should watch it in order to appreciate the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
