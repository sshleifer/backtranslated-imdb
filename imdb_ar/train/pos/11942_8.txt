At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Stromble (Ian MacShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubborn he was when he was looking for a scoop. At the same time, Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer of the London tarot card. Riber concedes to the American student Sandra Bransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the middle of a magical show of Sydney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the aristocrat killer Peter Lehman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra withdraws a master in her quest for evidence that Peter is the murderer. However, she falls into the fine and wonders whether Joe Strombel is right in his adventure. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great comedy for Woody Allen outside of Manhattan and back in London. His sarcastic and brilliant lines are simply fantastic, and he laughed a lot with his hero destiny in a country where people lead "the wrong side." Mr Waterman is very funny and Woody Allen is in excellent condition as a comedian. However, his current venture Scarlett Johansson, whom I adore so much, suffers from over-representation, which is annoying in many moments, changing her overall tone to a historic pronunciation. Her character is very silly and mixed, and I was very disappointed with her performance (perhaps for the first time in her film). But these superhero comics are still hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
