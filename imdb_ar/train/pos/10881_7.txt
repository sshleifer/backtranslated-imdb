"Cut" is a complete spoof of the italic type and basically achieves what it starts to do. Most of the standard slash clich√©s are present; the old creeping house, the jungle, the anonymous anonymous serial killer, the buckets of the bull, and of course the couple's killer couple during sex (hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The group - Simplicity is the same: school-obsessed schoolgirls began to complete an unfinished "masterpiece" unfinished, because of the death of a couple of cast members. This too - well, messy - gets rid of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are joined by a survivor of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who steals the film completely because it gets the best lines. The rest of the team is well suited to their roles, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays her role straight while the chaos and heirs erupt around her. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of red herring and fake suspicious moments, and there is little time to try to figure out who is the killer because the movie moves so fast. It also has a suitable low budget look, including some clumsy modifications that may be deliberate. Soundtrack is good, too. If there is difficulty with this movie, it will determine whether to send or greet to the italic type. Maybe a little bit of the two.
