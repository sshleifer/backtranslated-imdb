This movie contains some amazing things. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. This, in itself, is amazing that many hurricanes will hit the same city at night in Nebraska. I wonder if the name of the real city is close to "Blainsworth" (a city name in the film). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that begins with Blains - something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest hurricanes recorded in the watch where the boys are at home. On the other hand, the scene in which the television takes place is actually mysterious. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, we learned that if you turn the TV into a certain channel (not on the cable) and you set the brightness completely, you can see if there is a hurricane coming. The problem was that by that time you would be able to hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about hurricanes in the Midwest, it has made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than the hurricane. I mean, give me a break - there's no way you can pass through the F5 by connecting yourself to the tube in the well house.
