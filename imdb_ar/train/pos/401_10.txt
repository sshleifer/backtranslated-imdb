I just returned from Hong Kong on my summer holidays and I saw the legend of ZU. I thought he kicked! They were creative and unique. It's the Dragon Crouching Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought that there were a lot of special foreign currency (yes true!), You can not complain from the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung okay !!! Legend of ZU ..... kicks a * s !!!!!!!!
