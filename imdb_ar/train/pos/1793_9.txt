I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely love this movie. I loved everything in this subject, from the happy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes in which Mami Jomer (Laila) cries because of her bad decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she really is in love. I loved these moments because they were very real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped it would not end up like Bobby, who was a wonderful team but it was a bad film written and did not contain real meat. But in the middle of the film I felt quite different. You will laugh and cry but in the end you'll want to see the evening again. Trust me when I say GO SEE IT!
