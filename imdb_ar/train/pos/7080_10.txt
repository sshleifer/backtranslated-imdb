Terry Gilliam offers an amazing film, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the appearance of Christopher Plummer makes the movie very wonderful! This is Terry Gilliam's only film I've seen, and certainly Twelve Monkeys is among the top 10 movies. I think this is one of the best four films Bruce Willis and the best Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Probably one of the top ten actors I have ever seen. He played his role (Jeffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also convincing. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt behaved very well. With a wonderful story to support great performances. To support this, Terry Gilliam steers gorgeous.
