WWE Armageddon, 17 December 2006 - Live Streaming from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, Virginia <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in Inferno: So this is the fourth game ever in the WWE namely Kane vs MVP (I wonder why it was the first match on the card). I just watched the finished parts where Ken was lighting the fire in the MVP as they were sitting on the apron and then the MVP was circling around the square while screaming ?? Eventually, the fire extinguished a fire extinguisher as the MVP stretched around the entrance ramp. Funny and visually end very entertaining. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: William Regal and Dave Taylor were supposed to be in front of Brian Kendrick and Paul London (C) in a regular team match. GM, however, comes to the ring and announces that it will be a peaceful match for the four-way Felt team. MNM and Hardys are all thrown into chaos. One word to describe eye opener ?? Wonderful. Hey man, I can not really remember the number of sick sites that were present in this game, words can not really do it. There was a particularly prominent point where the Hardys set up a vision ladder, Jeff jumped from the upper rope while Matt was carrying MNM to kill, then WHAM! Nitro exploded away apparently that Mercury had failed and was bleeding like hell with tears on his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone. Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while jumping off the ladder. There were other places that held their breath, they could not be remembered. London finally pulled out the belts to win the show. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes on the powerbomb sit-up to win and then the worm worms troll over Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this stealth for three minutes. <br /> <br /> US Championship: Chris Benoit (C) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero match. Some good sites included a superplex off the upper rope for Shavo and an unusually long string of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with a belt to install on Benoit but Benoit scares it and takes time to decide whether to put it in Sharpshooter or not. This allows Shavo to start the renovation process but Benoah rolls it back and Shavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. game over. A tough battle is hard though sometimes slow. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Championship WWE Cruiserweight: Gregory Helms (C) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this, in a fairly moderate match. Did the match have some good sites that are flying on ice? Most notably Helms moving from the top of the rope ?? But it seems that the crowd did not enter him after watching the game of peace, Yang needs to get more air. Helms won the game after Yang was sent off by a knee injury. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in the "Last Flight" game: After a series of matches between these two, this time became the game "last trip" and the second of the kind must the winner to accompany his opponent off the pitch. pile. Really good for what these two people might offer. Kennedy has managed to handle a large number of Taker and even freed from Chokeslam to throw the Taker from the Armageddon group about 15 feet away; thankfully for Kennedy, otherwise it would be brutal. Kennedy got almost to victory that Takir regained inside the hearts (I liked showing the camera inside the heart). After that, Tucker missed throwing a steel pipe at Kennedy and broke the heart window instead, but then adjusted Kennedy's chair open, followed with a sequential chokeslam and a Tombstone on the surface of the hearts. Kennedy was unconscious and Tucker took him out of the arena to win. I found myself really interested in the willingness of these people to take / give real shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa comes into the ring, I go "What the hell?" Like many children in the crowd, then the word "underwear contest" in my ears. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena against Finley and King Booker: Talk about charisma versus technique. This was really a very good key event as the momentum shifted from one team to another and kept a good thrill. So Finlay got some good shots on his opponents this time (I doubted his strength against the heroes), and he and Poker did not basically succeed in cheating ?? Only at one point where poker stomped his knife in the throat of Senna. Batista hits the bomb at Poker to win, could not see F-U; Cena performed 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyway and I think he also made STFU. This was probably the best technical game of the night and the participants did really well what they could do without the 7.5 / 10 ladder. <br /> <br /> Since I am a WWE fan both inside and outside the game, I must agree that Armageddon was associated with many From banners all over the place, and in the end swallowed the half-width game of the game; Last Ride was characterized by some sites of some concern, and the main event was very good for its class. All other games were up to your bills except maybe the game Boogeyman vs. The Miz and competition are useless underwear. The Armageddon total was highly motivated for every show and despite some major setbacks earlier in the PPV timeline, Armageddon would like to be honored this year with respect. Classification of PPV: 8/10.
