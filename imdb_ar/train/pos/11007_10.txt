Jeremy Northham describes Murkie Sullivan, a struggling and moderate writer who is watching him leaving small pieces of his real identity under the influence of the single malt Scotch and Lucy Liu's presence, brilliantly and easily watching. Presenting her a cigarette in the bar is usually old, done without thinking or even asked and lost in her face, neck and lip. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way of perseverance. Nor can "brainwash" love any of his two fake wives. In the gradual stages, he begins to shed his glasses and walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the film progresses. The music is wonderful, hypnotic, exciting and sometimes appropriate driving. The widespread use of white, black and gray tones makes this film almost noir of science fiction in the traditions of many classical novels. I wanted to see more weakness in the portrayal of Lucy Liu, the more he saw him in his various dilapidated states, the man he loved and who performed his mission on blind faith, some limited weaknesses, a real sympathy and anxiety that made her perform far less. It does not match Northam's talents, but I enjoyed this film very well and enjoyed learning other scenarios written by the author himself.
