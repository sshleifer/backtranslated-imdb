I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addicted, but I love it. I'm in the second season, Disc 5, and I tell you I'm very attached to the characters now. Anything bad happens to them will seriously affect my voting for the show. And Michael on my list now. Kidding ... I'm very happy to see the third season, because I was so afraid of getting into disc 6 thinking it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors in Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before Lost, I was browsing through every channel you go to bed sad because of my disappointment on TV, but I must say that Lost is a kind of my entertainment!
