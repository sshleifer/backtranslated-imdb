Very good adaptation of the novel by Amrita Pretam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpayee gave their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural tendency in the film and I felt it completely. It seemed as though Bollywood had finally given its charm and performance to some quality artists on the screen. <br /> <br /> The content was wise. The film portrayed exactly what happened during the division by showing the suffering of a particular family, as well as the displays of this confidence in one's life beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best thing is that they did not make it a drama with a lot of shedding tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just liked it.
