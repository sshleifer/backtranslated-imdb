Every child has this film that emerges in the VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter. This was the film for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you exactly the whole plot, I must have seen it at least 100 times, and I can say it's a good movie for kids / family. <br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I have not seen it in 5 years, but maybe I'll shoot it this week, and I'll be a kid for today. <br /> <br /> You just have to love care bears, and their message. <br /> <br />
