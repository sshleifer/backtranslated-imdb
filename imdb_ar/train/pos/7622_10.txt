I love this show! It's like watching a small movie every week !!! The first episode was very scary and scary ... so it was part 2 of the pilot ... I will definitely continue this show! This is the real survivor! I took a look at a few other comments and I can already see that after only one or two episodes, the crying here was already crying wolf ... Sorry if it was not another realistic show, oh kids! There was once where there was ... preparing now! Actual TV Shows! This is actually good unlike most crazy sitcoms today or the 10th carbon version of the Law & Order series or the NYPD Blue or CSI series you dream of ... Watch this yourself to shape your mind, do not take one of the heads here!
