One of the latest classic of the new French wave. For direction, cinema Jean Ostach derived from the simplicity of cinema in the early 20th century. For the story, Jostach relied on the torment of his complex emotional life. A lot of things can be said about this film - wonderful observation; prolonging the soul with tolerance. Sometimes hilarious. Emotional drain ... etc. In my opinion, any complaints that can be directed against this film are easily overcome by its many strengths. Any film student, writer or anyone who wants to deal with a 3-hour film without any sudden cuts, no heavy music video, no distractions like the opera series, and no ordinary dialogue can make it a point to watch this film. Everything is admirable: writing (concise, clever, amazingly funny), acting (everyone is simply perfect in each other's roles), and the simple direction (the viewer feels as an informal observer within the film) makes this film unforgettable. It is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
