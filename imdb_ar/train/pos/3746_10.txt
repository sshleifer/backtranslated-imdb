I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite part is the French song and in the opening title when the spooky soldier screams "SPOONS" I crack every time. I recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who enjoy other Jason Steele movies. His style of animation is very original. Take some observations and note the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also cheerful, and certainly not something he has heard before. Such as Max Spatula deformed who has a sound system and light in his head lights up colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime anywhere.
