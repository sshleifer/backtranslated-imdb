I will not lie, it's a wonderful film. I've seen him about 4 months ago in my home theater. I saw her again, and I was rather bored in the slow scenes. Sid (Laziness) is not all that temptation, but Diego (Lion Mountain, I think) is really good in the film. The animation is wonderful, and the story has an impressive ending. Children aged 10 and under should be taken, but teenagers may find it a little boring. Also, the uniqueness in the characters is very interesting. As I said, it's a very good movie, but I'll label "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 10/08
