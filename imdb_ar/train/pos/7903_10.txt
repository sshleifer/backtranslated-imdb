I saw this movie in the first seconds with T.R. It took me to the trip - I hated the big thumb at first, but the absurd humor and terrible looks of both actors Sisi - I do not know who played her role - but she was fantastic as well as she was uma !!! - <br /> <br /> The other two who came out of the cinema after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and always watching the movie I love well with one of my friends - and we also enjoyed them - very funny laughs - sadness about "real police - the normal situation. " We both liked T.Robbins ... I found him well - he thought, that Robbins would agree too, although I have no idea if he likes the film or not ... <br /> <br /> I like to see the broken things - I heard that gus v. Sand had to take out a lot of scenes because viewers for the first time (or producers ???) still had a good artistic film. Although it's so short ... it's one of my favorite movies - and I realize that most people can not show this type of film and the assumption that people who enjoy these movies are what they think ... ... lol. Hopefully the day will come when the DVD will contain the complete material - hoping to see more crispy, kiano - expecting to see her baby and all <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see it, think twice and enjoy it if you have I took the option to watch ... m
