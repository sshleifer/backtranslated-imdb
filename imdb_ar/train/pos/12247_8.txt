I really liked this version of Emma's best. Kate Beckinsell was as wonderful as Emma and the strong mark was very good as a knight. The only complaint I had on Mr. Woodhouse .. I can not believe that a man can complain a lot or very selfish in the life of his daughter .. was a smart girl in the end. As always, I like the places where Jane Austen's movies were filmed. The settings are great too. Makes me want to visit England a lot like Ireland and Scotland) I think the actors who were selected for this film were also a good choice, and all the other story lines are intertwined with Emma's best! I'm glad I got to see this too.
