Passionate, sexy, fixative as Flamenco himself, the film is simply stunning. It is set on timeless Bizet Music. The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, the main proponent of Modern Flamenco style, Paco de Lucia, which plays the same name. The legendary dancer and dancer Antonio Gadez participated in scriptwriting and designed this wonderful version of George Bezet / Prosper Merremé Novella / Opera. Plays a key role in Antonio, a famous dancer / dancewriter who recounts Carmen's flamenco style, which combines dances, singing and rhythmic rhythmic applause, and has a very charged level of dynamics that attracts viewers. <br /> <br /> Cristina Hoyos is a brilliant and brilliant artist who outperforms her art with elegant art to dance in the supporting role. Hoyos was the first dancer in Gades for twenty years (1968-1988) and was the protagonist of three films by Carlos Saura from three great performances of Gades: Budas de Sanger (1978), Carmen (1983) and El Amor Brujo "(1985). Laura Del Sol, a young dancer named Carmen, sees Anthony from the first glimpse of Carmen, written by two Frenchmen, the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novel, written in 1846, which inspired George Bezier's famous comet of 1875. < <br /> <br /> As in the opera and in the novel, Carmen in the film Sora is desirable and deadly, femme femmes that must be free above anything else. She could not tolerate the love of any man and preferred death to submission. There are about 50 films adapted from the story and the opera on screen, and different as they are, all of which share the only possible tragic end. Saura / Gades is unique as the most exciting film for everyone and truly Spanish. I have fallen in love with her since the first time I saw her in more than twenty years, and today she is as wonderful and beautiful as she was at the time. Highly recommended.
