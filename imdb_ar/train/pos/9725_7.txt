"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not based on the betrayals of Tiger Woods. It is a modest romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about his experiences working as a celebrity journalist. The film is played by Simon Big as Sidney Young, a narrow British journalist working for a famous New York magazine. The youth restless in falling into all kinds of tricks to evoke all around him and hence the title of the film. It's noisy, bold, and camouflage. However, for a very strange reason, he is a somewhat likable character. My friend endorses his fellow journalist, and composed by Olson Olsen, played admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney longs primarily for the actress Sophothe Maes sexpot played by the wonderful Megan Fox. This fox is short in mastery of acting but high on the substance of "eye candy". Sidney gets all sorts of trifles in order to raise the journalist's hand in magazine magazine. That is the height of the comedy moments of the film. However, I think director Robert Weedy and scriptwriter Peter Straugan might lose some viewers and discredit authentic rom com content by developing an unreasonable romantic conspiracy line between Sydney and Allison; although the Weidstraughan team wrote an amusing story otherwise. He tied his character to the wire through his funny performance as Sydney Young. Jeff Bridges once again built "The Dodd" bridges with his witty supporting work like Clayton Harding, the magazine's leading magazine. But the rest of the film's representation was not worth enough to be shown here. "How to lose friends and isolation" should not be completely isolated, but some film friends may lose if they are published as a super-romantic comedy. *** Rate
