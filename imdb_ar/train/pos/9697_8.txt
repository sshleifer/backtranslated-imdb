This is a really gratifying family film. She has a very good training on animals and "acting" (if you can call it that) as well (just think of the dog in "How Christmas Grins Stole" ... it was a bad training) The story of Pauli is very good, well reproduced and generally done The characters put very well. Nothing more to say that this is a great movie! <br /> <br /> My ratings are: Story 8.5 / 10, Acting 7.5 / 10, Animals + 8.5 Ã— 10, Cinematography 8/10. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - great movies and watching movies worth watching!
