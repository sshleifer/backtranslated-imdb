It's not always easy to explain the shape of the film, but I think I've found it this time. This reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (short-term criminals recording some drugs and doing stupid things in Schotland) and Blair's witch project (because of the technique of photography). <br /> <br /> It is about allegiance between two friends, one of whom is out of prison, and the other has not yet been arrested. With a stolen car, they drove across the Scottish countryside but ran out of gasoline. While trying to find some fuel, they found a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to steal him and throw a gun at one of them. Everything is going wrong. A friend accidentally shoots the peasant's daughter and they have to flee. The following is a man hunt through the fields and forests of Shetland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. <br /> <br /> This film appears to have been filmed in just 12 days. Well, this is quite incredible because the bulk of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find it wonderful. Especially since this is not a bad film. The film may not be greater than ever, but they can still be proud of what they have accomplished. I had a great time watching it, and I enjoyed the film overall. Give it 7/10.
