This film features Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays the role of Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays the role of Calamity Jane and Charles Beckford plays the role of the bad guy who sells weapons to Indians and you can not recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B worked. Demel and Gary Cooper together, and the next film he made is essentially the same but was assigned at a different time. This film begins with the assassination of Lincoln and also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane adores Wild Bill and married Buffalo Bill and now wants to stay at home. This film also deals with the latest position of Custer, which is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is as good as usual and usually I do not like Jean Arthur but I loved her here.
