I must mention two failures in order to understand that this film worked brilliantly where they failed: "Dark Scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you are passionate about the concepts of these two films and feel disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy the Renaissance. It immerses you in the future world of Paris. It's not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotated, but what I can say is, it was not just a motion capture. Amazing facial expressions! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world being well presented in a lively / vivid hybrid. A black and white medium is used to draw your attention slowly to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect is what they did with the beams of the headlights, watch it. The director plays with your interest and confusion, but you are satisfied in the end by finding the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a harsh and brave urban world full of small surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is minor, but it is not terrible. It's noir nest. There is a background to most key characters to give them some depth. There is weather. There are "groups" so you feel in different places in Paris. There are some procedures, even a car chase. I'll see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to view as detailed "kits" and small balances.
