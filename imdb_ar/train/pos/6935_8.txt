James Stewart starred in a classic Western revenge story linking the fate of the films with star Winchester Rave. Stewart goes on to say excellent to add some cold obsession to the usual back cowboy. The story follows the fate of Winchester's gun and its owners after our hero won the contest and was robbed by the man he hunted. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of gamblers, gun fighters, Indian traders and bank funds. We follow the path of guns through Indian battles, bank robberies and so on. The support team are all strong with Dan Doria, who stands in the lead while Waco Johnny Deane is a fighter with live wires with a stinging trigger finger. As a trivial observation also a very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian leader. <br /> <br /> The final showdown is a tense classic battle that they fought for a long time in and around rocky rock. Enjoy an old western adventure, fist fights, shooting and horse-hunting that make it a Western adventure. 10/08
