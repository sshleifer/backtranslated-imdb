I grew up in this film and I can remember when I and my brother were playing in the backyard and pretending that we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after many years, I get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch it and enjoy it. If you are a parent and you did not watch this movie with your children, you should do it, just put them in your arms and watch them feel excited about the bears caring and caring! The songs, especially the "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I strongly recommend this film to all children so that they can know how much fun to take care of others! When it comes to all the trash on your TV, you can raise your children to have the right frame for life with movies like this.
