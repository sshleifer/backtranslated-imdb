11 Oscar nominations and zero wins !!! I still did not understand why - the actors in the film did not do anything better then you could make them award them for trivial roles like Halley Berry and Denzel Washington - Wobe, Opera, Margaret Avery and Danny Glover were all amazing - I'm curious to get discussion texts The Oscars that year ... should be in the category "should be -kanda" for the judges .... <br /> <br /> It's an amazing book - but according to the Alice Walker style of writing, It has a way of looking like it's overpriced - so I'm very happy because they've adapted the screen with a few things. <br /> <br /> The film industry was spectacular - African scenes are living much - which is supposed to be the African part of the book in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but no! Steven Spielberg believes that the world is so stupid that they can not think of Africa outside safaris - so there must have been a free spectacle of zebra and wildlife when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and most of all why people who speak Swahili - Who in West Africa speaks Swahili? I just had to do it away ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, filmmaking - outside this world - classic YES !! <br /> I own it and see it when my soul needs some renewal.
