I read the book and watched the film. Both are excellent. The film is a diamond between coal during this age. Lippman and Sylby control the screen and convey their character without blemish. This movie had to make them stars. Shame on the studio for not putting all their behind this movie. It can easily be a privilege. The release on DVD is necessary and the new movie must re-release this movie. Look for it in your TV guide, and if you see it listed, regardless of the delay, see it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another interest - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we would like to believe they have changed.
