There are some excellent comments and comments on this film. I was pleased to refer to comparisons made by Fritz Lang with "M" (forget the failed fiftieth edition with David Wayne Lightweight). The real villain is not the tortured killer (very well performed by Jeffrey Dimon), where he was enraged by his frustrated sexual anger at his victims - mostly children. Is the goal. The real villain is the suffocating bureaucratic Soviet system, which drowns in its corrupt incompetence. A man who is relentlessly dedicated (Ria in his best role since the "Crying Game"), an easy pragmatist who wants to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland is always successful in this type of role), is hesitant and frightening but is designed by a psychologist (Max Sedo) ), The vaguely modest bureaucrat of a public prosecutor (the wonderful British actor John Wood) and the quiet wife supporting the paid investigator (Moed Sar, Imelda Staunton). This is a damn good movie. Dark and dark are supported by portraying a corrupt and incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to indulge in the thrilling dice that have characterized many modern films. Gore present - it is a shocking story - but adds to the depiction of a human being wrapped around. The success of the story is precisely the following: These were acts committed by a person, a person like you or me. Where you and I chose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chicatello took his wrath on our innocent and weak, our sons. The wonderful premise of this story is reflected in a wonderful collection of excellent actors. - Unfortunately, I noticed that our Australian friend did not like the speech and was sure he would have preferred to hear them speaking the Australian dialect. Well, very bad. Sure, this wonderful film has worked for me and everyone else I've talked to.
