This real drama revolves around personal and stories on a level that is most ashamed of what we see on TV in Mo. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the start. Do not be late if you do not have a science fiction (like me ...) This can happen on the ground, the fact that in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. There are no space ships or laser pistols (there's nothing anyway) so far I've seen up to s01 e04 and I'm wondering what will happen next because there are many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast plays there roles with pasion. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This offer really exists well, it does not matter if you watch BSG or not, they are really quite different. I have read some negative reviews of science fiction geeks who expected less drama and more foreigners and shotguns etc, but I say they ignored them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start to show. Let's hope they can not do it after 1 or 2 seasons as they usually do with good offers these days.
