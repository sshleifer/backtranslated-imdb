I'm not saying that as a Chris Rock fan, I'm saying this as someone who had low expectations to go to this movie and proved wrong. The first drawback is that it is all over, where everyone thought it would come. The second mistake: I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock looked fake. Finally, the acting in this film was substandard, where the best actor was Regina King and the worst was Marc Eddie. But in the past I saw this flaw and saw a strong comedy. In an individual confrontation scenario, a witness of the sky can wait instead, it's better. So for both Chris Rock fans there, watch this movie, you will enjoy it. He has some good positions in this film. <br /> <br /> In general: 7 out of 10
