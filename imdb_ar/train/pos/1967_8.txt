I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are very bad in the world, unless you're out of rock. I found it sick, wonderful, crooked, and psychologically sophisticated. Will not deepen into the minds of a mentally ill criminal in a Hollywood film more than this film. Contains layers within the layers, carefully acting by Stone, and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's finished. People need to go beyond the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old, and that Michael Douglas is not in this place. I expect this movie to be a great success on DVD once people see it and stop paying attention to the professional reviewers. Give her a chance, you may be happy because you did!
