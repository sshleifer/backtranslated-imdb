I loved this show very much, and I am very sad because it was canceled and I thought it was back too, but only two stupid weeks. This is terrible. I hate how you never know how everyone ends up. It sucks. Prepare it! ABC has stupid offers like Supernanny and butnot but does not give time for good shows like Six Degrees. If they complain about ratings, it might be because they have a bad opening because it was a really good offer, something I can expect and expect. JJ Abrams has been delivered, it's great, and I hope ABC trusts him enough to complete the story. I loved the whole team too. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet one day at a time. Everyone's story is now incomplete, and now I will not know whether Stephen and Whitney will meet or Carlos and Mai. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and anyone else. This is really such a downer.
