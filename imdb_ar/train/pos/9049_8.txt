There is an old saying about John Johnston's new controversial film, "The Man Who Thought He Can and the Man Who Does not Believe It Can not." This overly hypothetical phrase refers to self-motivation and individual faith, which seems true in this film even after the roadblocks and family problems stand in the way. <br /> <br /> "Sky October" revolves around a self-confident young man named Homer Hickam, who grew up in a strict traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small town to extract coal, where every man grows up to be almost a mine. All his friends, Quentin, Roy, and Odell believed that their life after high school would be like the lives of others. Homer did not come out of this future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone is staring into the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik passes through the sky. This is something new for Homer, and he finds it wonderful and charming. From this point, his view of life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket world for the occupation. After being shocked at what he says, his family goes through this idea and continues to live as usual, yet his friends believe that this idea might have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent individual when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends start testing the missile models and detonate a white picket fence for the elements, then it seems that the forest fires are afraid of them and they are forced to finish their advance. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film go from start to finish. All actors make presentations as if this is the real jumbo here. Emerging in all glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This may be a good thing from the Academy Awards if the referees can remember the beginning of the year when the film is screened. <br /> <br /> The characters were also developed very well. Not only for directors who provide a clear cause for Homer's interest in the subject, but also tell the audience how to test the missiles. We clearly understand all the motivations and beliefs of the characters, especially the Father, who are designed for eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> The film, unfortunately, loses some of its mid-term momentum because of its ridiculous, recycled romantic sub-plot involving the love of Homer's love and how his brother robbed him of it. This genre has become very common in high school movies, not that this film targets high school. Actors stare at each other carelessly, like they are in ecstasy. I dealt with her without complaint in Abbott's invention in 1997, but I had enough of that. <br /> <br /> But this is just a simple complaint. With an authentic perspective period, cinematography deserves the Oscar and clips of real life Homer and friends eventually, who have made great success with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great movie of 1999. <br /> <br />
