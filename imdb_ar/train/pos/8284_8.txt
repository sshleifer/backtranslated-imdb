This is a unique horror film that requires a more mature understanding of the word "horror" until it is appreciated. The main thing that people may fail to realize is that this story is narrated through a little boy's look, and as with most younger children, it is easily intimidated. The main reason for this is that he simply does not understand things, such as why his father does not have him. From watching the movie, you can see the husband discussing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not. As one can imagine that the boy afraid of the forest, as proved early in the film, that the family of the city. Also, at first while the family was traveling home they ran into deer, then stopped, then argue with the locals about it, and certainly the little boy did not find this forest introduction pleasant at all. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is in the end what his innocent little mind brings out to explain all this. There is the American Indian legend, but when looking at where the boy hears about it, he is explained to him plainly and simply. Not because this is what Wendigo actually does, but because that is what he understands. When you look at the movie from this point of view, you can really begin to appreciate it. Obviously they were low budget and shot cheaply, but the jump montage, the use of light, and the general oddity more than compensated. The last question posed by the film is: Is everything in your head or does it really exist? 8/10 <br /> <br /> R classification: profanity, violence and sexual scene
