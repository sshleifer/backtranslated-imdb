When I first saw this film, in London, in 1958, I felt good. I have never seen a film like this before. It had a strange and hypnotic effect, unlike the films I had seen before and left a lasting influence. <br /> <br /> I think Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. The interaction is certainly amazing in its ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this is converted to a DVD - in Region 2 format - and in original French, I'd love to hear about it and where to buy it.
