I gave this movie 7 out of 10 because the bad guys were fun in their roles and the beloved little woman created an interesting "guessing" game. The film, however, needs more Robin in it. Appeared in the film initially and intermittently throughout the remainder of the film. I always thought that the new cartoon series did achieve little justice for Robin's stylish personality, let alone the Knightwing. This film is still just this bad tradition. The film spends a long time on Bruce Wayne and his romance that will not be too bad in one film if the romance is not spectacular. Still a good movie if you are a fan of Batman and I recommend watching it.
