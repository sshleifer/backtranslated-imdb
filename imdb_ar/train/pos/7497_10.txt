I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store on the way back when. I've always been a fan of the Western world and when I watched this video, I rented it and watched it. I was so young that I did not appreciate all the humor and spelling of Al at the time, but I remember it later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a fan of "Al", especially from his previous works, you will enjoy this movie perfectly. This is done in the "Rockumentary" style of MTV-esque and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al came to where he was in 1985. You will love her if you love his comic brand and most importantly, his music.
