"House of Games" is a flawless movie, and one of the few films I saw made me find a gap on the screen in astonishment at how it ends up smartly and unexpectedly. I first saw him on a video a few years ago reading a review by Roger Ebert, who announced that he was the best film in 1987. I had doubts, mainly because he is not quite as well known as other films of that year. Boy, I was in for a surprise. This was one of the most intelligent and written movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Scenario presentation is an integral part of the work, not only in relation to the scheme (which wraps and manages and pulls the carpet out of you just when you think you have everything figured out), but also in terms of personal development. In my second look, I began to realize that the Mamet script does not only succeed as an intelligent thriller, but every piece of land development contributes to our understanding of characters and their motives. Film climax is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about characters, and is therefore much more than just an arbitrary end. Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add to the film. I can not portray any other actor alongside Mantegna playing Mike, and Krauss plays her role with the proper restraint to suggest a suppressed criminal mentality. Their work, combined with the extraordinary Mamit script, combines to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It's really a must see.
