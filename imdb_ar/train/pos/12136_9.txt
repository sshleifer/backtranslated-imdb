Shortly after the imposition of a code of ethics, the lives of writers, directors and actors were closed, and the first film was made for "Human Bondage" by Somerset Mugam. It has no shock value today, it's just a good representation. <br /> <br /> Although the cast is excellent, this is the first role played by Bette Davis and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is the witty Parisian artist Philippe Carey, who gently told him that he lacked any talent and that his devotion was not a substitute for true genius. He took the lesson to his heart when he returned to London and joined a medical school (one, by the way, did not seem to include students - at that time there were at least a few, perhaps the author / doctor Mugam did not take medical dystaff). <br /> <br /> Tea One day, Carrie was introduced to a waitress, Mildred Rogers, and Davis House as a morally loose and evil Fargo. She has a sharp accent cocoon like Eliza Dolittle. His repeated attempts to date have received a less enthusiastic response, "I do not mind," a sure sign for any man whose head is directly tipped as deep. Mugred Mugred's tips complemented her waitress with a little old-fashioned street walk, something that was not clearly featured here. <br /> <br /> The besieged Carrie prisons offer Rogers bold need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her, playing with him as a church musician in a Sunday church who distributes her instruments effortlessly. Do not have sex here. Realizing that he does not get anywhere, a chastity begins with Norah, a woman he loves. Re-enter Mildred, filled with the baby, and her usual need to take care of her. Out of sorrow Nora. <br /> <br /> There is another detachment from Mildred and Carrie begins a long-term friendship with Sally, whom her father enthusiastically incites and seems to be seen marrying in the end as a good thing for both young people and a chance to rest one of his nine offspring. <br /> <br /> The film is reasonable but does not fully follow the excellent Maugham novel. Carrie Howard is naive and weak, and for many of the film, his sad eyes recall one of his colleagues facing a double-barreled gun. Mildred is unquestionably wicked, and is a user of the worst species, and her only preoccupation with her own needs is disguised when she tries to warn Carey of a thinness of kind words (and at some time promises her that she will do "anything he wants", a bold statement of times and I say Surely the masses are well understood. <br /> <br /> It may be a symbol, but Mildred's expedition in the march was to the satisfaction of the Catholic bond of decency, the end of which is the loss of traditional sin and the triumphs of principled behavior. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell made excellent performances from his two main stars, one well-established, and the other largely founded because of him The film is worth the trip of London and back in time. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for the performance of Davis and Howard)
