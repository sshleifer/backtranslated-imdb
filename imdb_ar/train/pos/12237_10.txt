Game mating is a fascinating and wonderful movie of an era gone by. Hollywood needs to think about a magical reworking of this film. My wife and I will go to see her. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I saw on AMC. <br /> <br /> This film features Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is fantastic, as always. <br /> <br /> I loved him. We plan to order a DVD to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies are no longer too bad. <br /> <br /> Hi Hollywood Hey .... delete some of this kind of scripts from the old safe, do it a little bit (without spoiling the original movie and the script as it did with other remodeling), and continue to communicate loudly . <br /> <br /> The new edition will be a great success on the silver screen, DVD and on cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, Texas
