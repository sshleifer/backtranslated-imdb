I read the book in the fifth grade and now after a few years I saw the film. There are some differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day by 7:00 pm. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the film after Billy has eaten all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his clothes. <br /> <br /> 3. It's supposed to be a fake atmosphere for some worms, but in the film, it does not. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this film is still enjoyed by children.
