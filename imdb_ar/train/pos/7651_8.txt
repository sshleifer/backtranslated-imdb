An interesting television film based on a real truth, betrayed by the description of a prominent figure, a prisoner. Giovanni Ribesi plays the role of his younger brother, who has a delicate task in deciding whether he will appeal to the court the death penalty for his brother. But when he goes to visit him and introduces Elias Cotias, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with the ability of representation in Kotias. It is only like a captive version of the proletarian roots according to "G.Q." Magazine, with a highly sophisticated language for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after I met again an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, who had spent in many Panamanian prisons. The young man I used to know went not only because he was older, but because of his long exposure to the sanctions regime. There are prisons and there are prisons, one must say, but this one prisoner in the "heart shot" is definitely out of this world.
