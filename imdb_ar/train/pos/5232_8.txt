This film is a journey across the mind of a screenwriter caught in his contradictory philosophy. He examines the question of illusion ever "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a courageous and thought-provoking institution. There is a load of beautiful images, paradoxes inspired by the dream, which resemble Escher, remind us to draw the same hand, or rather erase itself. We follow the writer more and more in his suffering about what he says and what we will see, and we see him talking by telephone with his wife who left for Peru, leaving her care for their child, a task performed with less and less attention has been so absorbed in his dilemma that he no longer looks at the child anymore. His wife returns and makes a spectacle, destroys his notes and helps him over the last event to erase himself. Interspersed with stunning images and destructive nature, and the story is mainly philosophical. It is around the Mayan veil, the world of illusion. But the paradox of the film is that he needs a lot of talk and thinking to prove that thinking must stop. During more than two hours of provocative beauty and quick philosophy made me a long film for silent or for a shorter film. If this is the purpose of the maker, it worked well.
