I read holes in the fifth grade, when I heard they were doing a movie I was ecstasy! Of course, as I was busy, I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in the theaters. The holes were in the drive outside the city, but, alas, we were very busy. I was surprised when I heard that all my friends saw it and none of them called me! They all said it was good, but I read great books that made crazy movies so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, it became the perfect opportunity to see it. That week my father was on a cruise and left to babysitter. My sister, 9 years old, saw her and loved her perfectly! After that, I transferred them to other people I was in the babysitting house and loved their kids, 9 and 4, too. My parents loved her and they are very good critics of the films. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands the morale of the family and loves the funny team! This movie should be within the best 5 "watch" list !!!!
