That's true. The film is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the film is much better. This film features Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duval at their best. (I have never seen Scatman Crothers obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about those in my comment on the mini-series. But, I missed a few. The film was filmed in a better location than the place where the mini-series was filmed. REDRUM scenes are creepy from those in the book. If you're looking for a great movie, get The Shining from Stanley Kubrick. But rely on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks
