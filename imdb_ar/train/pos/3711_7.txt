"Ginger Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Logton directed "The Night of the Hunter," a cross-section of the Southern Gothic, in which Robert Mitchum plays the role of a serial killer. One of the most famous serials in the film consists of two children running from Mitchum on a boat, frantically walking around as Mitchum walks around like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played the role of a neurosurgeon in "Cape Fear," another film in the American South. This film is distinguished by a local lawyer who tries to protect his family and ends up killing Mitchum by boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese attempted to differentiate and deal with something more common, recreating "Cape Fear", the boat scene and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman "The Gingerbread Man", another slice of the small town of Southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and to take such a mainstream film just because he wanted to "spread his wings and experience the image of popcorn," but what he is secretly trying to do is to dismantle church films of the Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So instead of confrontation on a small boat, we get a face on a giant ship. Instead of abducting two children, we safely return two children to the police. Instead of hiding money, we have funds that are easily provided via a will and a final certificate. Instead of the good lawyer for the 1961 film and the miserable lawyer in the new 1991 edition, we get a three-dimensional lawyer instead in Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys. Instead of storming the monster in the family house boat, we have the hero who hunts the beast on the "house ship" of the beast. Similarly, instead of a deadly serial killer, we get the innocent eccentric played by Robert Duval. . .etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues and continues, reflects everything a bit, moves at the edges and does what it does. The most obvious touch in half an hour is the first film, a film in an uncomfortable space between the traditional storytelling storyline, which is based on the plot, the intruder's intrusion into interlocking dialogue, the unusual narrative, the roving camera movement and the way in which characters are not often presented because they are simply part of Happen or occur. <br /> <br /> However, despite the best intentions of Altman, the film does not rise above the average. Altman is very committed to the standards of "excitement formula" to cause a lot of damage, his style is too idle to generate tension and the film simply is not radical enough to face other canonical films of this genre. Thus, the "ginger man" is the mainstream of the action as a more clean Altman film, as it does not work Altman as a normal excitement. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh, and Daryl Hannah, who are usually unbearable, play exciting performances. The film also has a nice atmosphere, offset by an approaching hurricane, and the last chapter contains some interesting twists and turns. Although it is not the full disaster of Scorsese's "Cape Fear," the film does not amount to anything special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman made three consecutive films in South America: Kansas City, The Ginger Man and Fortune Cookies. Unlike "ginger man," Kansas City and Cookie's Fortune deal with this kind of larger and more flexible painting that Altman was more comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, its pyramid of class, politics and crime, and its desire to move radically away from the typical frameworks of gangsters, will have an impact on all 21 films serious crime book in the film Century ( See, for example, "wire"). However, Fortune Cooks, although a tighter story, may be the best picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed "Images", a feature film. , In 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
