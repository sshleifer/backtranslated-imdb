Earth must see for children and adults. My son enjoyed watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this film and we have to take pride in our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. Exactly that problem must prevent all the powers of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary presents many extraordinary images that I have never seen before. Then accompanied by heavenly music. The manager did a great job here with great respect. Nothing could stop me and my family from giving the land a higher rate. I hope things create a complement.
