When it comes to this exciting genre, I'm lucky to browse the first 20 minutes of the chart without waking up or looking for something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Do not Touch Me) starred two very strong lead actors, Keira Reid and Doug Geoffrey in this thriller. Kira is convinced that Kim is an innocent sweet romantic novel that takes place in the "Guy" seduction network of Doug Geoffrey. Kira loses control of her inhibitors in the role, as an actress, giving what can just be the depth of T and A and credibility. I think it would be her best performance yet. The direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for the greens.
