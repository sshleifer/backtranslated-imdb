The Cinderella story is one of my favorites from Charles Perrolet, with Sleeping Beauty, also made in the Disney film of 1959; this film is a wonderful and charming masterpiece from Disney. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; this is one of the things I like in the movie, a very good audio track, and I love songs too; my favorite song is romance "So That's Love". I love mice from the film too, they are nice. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, small birds tried to wake up Cinderella in the morning. I love it too when the Cinderella animal friends (rats and birds) fix the clothes of Cinderella's mother, so you can go to the ball ... even ripped by Drezila and Anastasia by the pittets, the bus!
