"Man on Fire" tells the story of a former Special Forces man with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal guard for a young girl in Mexico during a wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first he was not friendly, but then they became friends to each other, he decided to stop drinking etc, etc. Then one day she was kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> Happiness, Stop at anything to get revenge. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man on fire but expect some great transformations at least several times including a beautiful ending that will likely make you cry. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the wonderful music performed by Harry Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (wrestler). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the film ... Wait ... The thing here is that everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> I. Representation. Denzel Washington at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Welln are in good shape as always, Radtha Mitchell and young Dakota Fanning Young. This is not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the stunning cinematic along with the wonderful editing, you should have won the Academy Award certainly. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge film. The story is smart, the story make you think ... and beautiful. Oh really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you need to watch in your life, at least once!
