In the 1960s, studios will use short films such as test rules for new actors because they are easier to produce than long feature films, so it is interesting that this star should be the star of Shirley Temple, who has long established herself as a child star The most famous of all time. Then again, maybe they were not being tested, I imagined that Frank Coglan Jr., who played the role of Shirley's brother Sony in the film and gave relatively less impressive performance. Then again, the nine-year-old Shirley Temple may not have been an easy job to accompany him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very calm vision, including a shrouded ceiling, presumably designed to be a Shirley statue. A crowded look at the ceiling, clarifying the working class of the family in the film and providing a clean transition to the next scene, Gently trampled in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny's birthday, and his father makes occasional and unsuccessful efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sony a dog he really wants for himself, but Sony is afraid of the dogs because he was bitten by someone and has ever crawled since . It is strange that when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to flee the house instead of having a dog in the house, and because he runs away with no destination on the horizon, it is also curious that the film illustrates what seems to be indifferent to the homeless who outweigh even the amazing indifference Found today. <br /> <br /> Sony passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet on the side of the train tracks (right after the train ride, which, due to its proximity to the tracks, will think it could have blown the man directly from the tracks, but regardless For that). After Sonny gives up sharing the breakfast because of the sour stare of his gentle smile from the man, it continues and the homeless person disappears from the film. It is interesting to think about what a longer film could have done, because this film leaves this poor man with a loose end. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sonny quickly hears a dog step down the substrate as it passes. So, jumps to find the dog sledding. It may seem vulgar that he takes the dog immediately and adopts it because he has just left the house because of his fear of dogs, but it seems to me that he only needs to remind him not of his authority over the dogs, but because of his lack of power over him. Once he saw a dog in need to overcome his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all I need, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm ready! <br /> <br /> It's a very appropriate film in which everything is done as it should be, but it's nice and fun enough (and short enough) to keep it fun. We do not really expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film, but Pardon My Pups still packs a great deal of story and character development in its short runtime. It also has a fighting scene at the end of the film that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert on Shirley Temple movies, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time.
