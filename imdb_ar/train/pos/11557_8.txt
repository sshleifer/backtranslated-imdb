She often laughs loudly, and sometimes it is a sad story about two very busy people - Lemon, a clean "neurotic husband" and Mattow, a math writer who decides to live together to cut costs. <br /> <br /> He was filmed and directed well. The script is very thorny - that is, there is always more than one side per line. The funny scene includes two British sisters (Evans and Chili) who seem to enjoy everything anyone says, but when Lemon scans his children, and yes, a former wife, he has the girls who cry with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
