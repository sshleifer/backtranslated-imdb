It's amazing to become a P.J. Soles starred as Riff Randall, the No. 1 fan of Ramones' punk rock band, at Rock 'n' Roll High School. The slippers are very large, do not mind it is obviously bigger than to stay in high school (this fact has been settled by making all children look at age 24). The film is a fast-paced funnel inseparable; everything is blown up in the stones at the end, just as it should be. Mary and Ronoff, the strange and funny natural presence as a Nazism-like director, gets something really unique at first when Frisbeez is flying dangerously close to her head (how many people have used it, or was it a coincidence?) And Dey Young is very attractive as the best, Kate Rambo. The weakest episode, ironically enough, in the "high school" chain gang is Rammons. They can not act, they are not funny, and the concerts sector goes on for a long time. One Ramones song, "I Want You Around," is treated as a fantasy and well captured; other good trackers are good, especially the rare Paul McCartney song I heard near the beginning ("Have we met somewhere before?"). Great fun! *** from ****
