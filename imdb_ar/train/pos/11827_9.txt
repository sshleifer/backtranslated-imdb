If Dick Tracy is black and white, the pope will not be religious. To give a fresh idea of ​​the concept of color in the film, we give us a unique experience throughout the world of cartoons, which is one of the few films that have succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good directing and fantastic performances (Al Pacino Stunning) and most importantly is a mix Strong of cinema, artistic design and fashion design. Using only basic colors, the experience is completely different from anything we've seen before. There is also a very successful success in all kinds of gangster films, extinct from modern cinema. In general, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of authenticity to the cinema that rely more and more on the old versions that have already been seen. 7 of 10.
