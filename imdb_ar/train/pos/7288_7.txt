This film is the absolute classic of the camp. That's why it was classic Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows the story. The world keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement as he wanders around the city trying to find a corpse by checking the local chicks. Finally, he finds a real object made of the hourglass and shows the head of a chick with a scar. The cropped head makes friends with the failed experience in the closet, heads out of the closet and tears the remaining "good" helper arm (the other is not true of a scientist's previous failure), and the whole place is burning. <br /> <br /> We scared the film so much like children that my friend did not go down to his basement for a year after seeing it. As children we rated the most horrifying movies of all time and this film was ranked fourth. Only one of those scary films was really good (the original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I had to give this film a rating of seven for the sheer amount of entertainment it offers. His strange effect due to crappy production and exotic sexual angle when the world searches for bodies (complete with a pornographic clip) scares the hell out of innocent children, while the funny aspects make it a staple to watch the talk and laughter. I was able to watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while better going to the Dentist instead of watching "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the most I can offer, because its entertainment value is just luck. The film, like cinema, is a disaster.
