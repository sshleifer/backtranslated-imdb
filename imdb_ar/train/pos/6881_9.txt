How can a film that shows Curtis Mayfield's vocals be bad? Not possible! The Groove Tube is a series of sketches that make fun of anything from 2001 to the Olympics. The best of all is the Ken Shapiro Dance at the crowded Manhattan Pier (this is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole only sings you I've just been dating now, but at the time Groove Tube was not very well dressed, bold, sarcastic and hysterical funny.Kin Shapiro realized this simple blow, and then after 7 years blew up Christmas Day, "modern problems" I've enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (Maybe he was playing drums in the jazz group) The Groove Tube stays in proportion لي Lee endless impulse of positive energy, a film after 26 years of primary viewing, still brings me a real joy!
