"The United States of Kiss My Ass" <br /> <br /> House of Games is the debut of playwright David Mamet, an exciting and sometimes impressive film. Starring Lindsay Krauss as the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who pushed one of her patients to think about suicide. They thus give up safety and comfort in their fairly normal lives and walk around downtown to visit the low-life place, House of Games. <br /> <br /> It turned out that the gambler Mike (played by Joe Mantegna) is excellent to be fairly sharp and shiny. If he wants to sit down with him in a game, a huge money game in the back room, he will give the character a crossover deal. The card game follows, and the psychiatrist and gambler are quickly seen in a familiar line of action (gaining the trust of others) and start a wonderful relationship. What makes House of Games interesting and the basic point of view for any film lover is the constant guessing of who controls, whether he is a psychiatrist or a fraudster or a known man of great tricks David Mamet. <br /> <br /> In House of Games, the direction is tedious and often flat and uninspiring, but in each of David Mamet's films, the story is central to the whole process, not the direction. At House of Games, this is partly due to the fantastic performances of Khayyubin (flashy and fragmented) but mainly like much of Mamit's work, it is the dialogue that catches you and slowly guides you to the film. No one in the gaming house says what it means and becomes talks battlefields and war words. Everyone cheats and tries, and reminds us of natural poker games. This is an ongoing theme throughout the film and is used to greatly influence the appropriate moments to create enormous tensions. House of Games can also be considered a "collective war". With Lindsay Crouse, we have a thoughtful middle-class psychiatrist, and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class in America earns living with a "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The movie tempts the scenes like Crouse by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. The end of the film is definitely something that everyone can see and watch, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> It's a very enjoyable movie experience that deserves frequent viewing. 9/10
