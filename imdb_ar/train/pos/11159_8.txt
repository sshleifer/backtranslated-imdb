This is a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of ridicule and ingenuity are dispelled by a delightful display of how the motivations of men and women are different (Vive la different!) <br /> <br /> You can love people though sometimes because of their weaknesses. Humans really a little nonsense, but we have big hearts and do our best, despite the temptation. This is not our fault when sometimes temptation can not be resisted, this is what we are. <br /> <br /> There is a consistent elegance from start to finish. Clear photography, sharp composition, very enjoyable watching when adding provocative content, well-suited music, laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the "very little wise sound" ... great. Wisdom of innocence balancing the comedy of the human condition.
