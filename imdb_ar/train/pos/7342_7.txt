I will not pretend to be a fan of Ralph Beckshi, because I am not. I've only watched 5 of his animated movies so far: Kunskin, Wizards, Fritz Cat and Lord of the Rings, and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can claim is that I found "Fire and Ice" the most fun in the game. It is a fictional story directly from swords and sorcery like Conan the Barbarian, but beautiful artwork, realistic animation and vibrant cinema give a classic charm to this film. <br /> <br /> Worth mentioning is the animation itself. I do not care what people say about endoscopy, but in my opinion Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was amazed by how realistic the characters' movements were. The "Fire and Ice" style of output and realistic design is more like a huge budget fantasy than animation. Sadly, the level of technical detail tends to slightly conflict, especially near the end of the film. Some scenes look quite flat with little or no details about the body's circumference or fabric folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, the real procedure follows naturally. The work was not only well designed, but very brutal. I would be too bold to compare the brutality of action with live action films such as the Zack Snyder 300 film. I noticed that although there was bloodshed, the blood spots were minimal. Again, a great choice by the creative team that increases the viewing experience only by not taking things "higher" as well. <br /> <br /> Although I do not know any "big names" in the actors, the sound enables the actors to perform satisfactorily; keeping each line physically defeated and blocked only in the case of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did you say bad guys ?? Yes, I did. Because this is exactly what the story revolves around, a good story versus an evil tale. There is nothing really original about the story that seems to be just a mix of cliches in fantasy films that include nude warriors dressed in great clothes. Anyone looking for "depth" would be very disappointed. No significant evolution of the characters, such as Nikon and the monochromatic Darwolf at best (I have heard rumors of some of the deleted scenes that explain Darkwell's obsession with the killing of Nickron and his mother, included in the final pieces to add a level of depth to the show). In fact, I was not surprised when I discovered that the entire film was just a "technical display" of some kind for the presentation of the great animation and art, where the story was assembled and thrown as a later idea to pass it as an appropriate "film". <br /> <br /> The real classic "Fire and Ice" film of the old age is truly the spirit of adventurous incarnation and mysticism through its beautiful displays of magnificent creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Friesaita with a great deal of action and thrill. <br /> <br /> Will you stick to the standards of animation today? of course not. But I encourage animators in general to "get off your high horse" and give this simple and beautiful film a chance to grow on you. It is really a gem of the eighties worth checking out.
