This film contains representatives from all the stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Moti, Cybil Shepard, and Jim Bellushi to name a few, running in Monte Carlo as well as some other beautiful European sites, and very funny. The problem everyone faces when they lie to protect themselves is great, I highly recommend watching this movie, it's worth it! John Candy in his Best Picture in One Upon A Crime, Like Anyone Else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Each person offers great performances, wonderful acting, great comedy, and wonderful timing, which is rare in movies these days. Big plot, great mystery, (which I like anyway) and in general, worth the money you spend on it. So get the children, grab some popcorn, juice or tea, or soft drinks, enjoy the show!
