Carla works in a real estate developer where she excels in being unattractive and inexhaustible. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> Her boss offers to hire someone to relieve her heavy workload, so she takes advantage of the opportunity to secure herself to a male company. The help comes in the form of Paul, a new tattoo leader outside the prison and clearly inadequate to the exhausting routine of the office environment. <br /> <br /> The implicit sexual tension between the two and Carla is determined to keep him in spite of his reluctance to embrace the work week. When Carla came out of an important contract negotiated by her delusional colleague, Paul's criminalization was exploited by making him steal the contract. The colleague quickly realized that she was behind the theft, but when confronted, Paul's willingness to punch people in the face was very helpful - but this bullying comes at a price. <br /> <br /> Paul was given the "move" by some mob acquaintances as a reminder of outstanding debts. He formulated a plan that uses Carla's unique lip reading abilities to uproot a band of violent bank thieves. It is Carla's turn now to enter a frightening new world. <br /> <br /> Jack Odier's fourth feature, "READ MY LIPS", begins as a very attractive romantic drama between lost losers just to turn the gears halfway to an exciting movie where their mutant shortcomings turn out to be winners. Excellent yarns Our effort to convince us that this strange pair can really communicate. Carla's first encounter with Paul is a fun farce in which she tries to outweigh his certain reservation and his tales in prison birds to discover that he was until very recently. Emmanuel Devos, who plays Carla, has this almost exclusive ability to move from dowry to cheer and back inside the frame. Vincent Cassell plays Paul as a besieged dog who appears at home only when he receives a beating or an accompaniment likely to be killed. <br /> <br /> Like many French movies, "READ MY LIPS" at first, it does not seem to mean anything in particular until you scratch the bottom of the surface and find that it probably relates to everything. The lost wife of the parole officer Paul; the device that appears to be fabricated only to help guide the main thrust of the story into a simple and elegant touch. <br /> <br /> The French "new wave" of the 1960s was the first to introduce the concept of "genre" Movies I have always felt that any medium is at some risk when you have to use a system of stickers to help identify them You always have the pleasure of discovering a movie that seems to transcend the genre, or better yet, challenge it.
