I was about 11 years old and I discovered that I live 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, Texas. They've added homes since making the film. I do not know the house number but you can search for it. I'm 21 now and enjoy watching this movie. The tape on Spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school for them. I drove home last week still a wonderful home. My father and uncle went to the street where the house was and watched the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the film. Where John crossed above the rail cracks they raised 225 higher. When I hear about John losing his son, I started thinking about when urban cowboys were made 26 or 25 years old.
