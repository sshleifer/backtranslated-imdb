What an amazing episode of this beautiful series. This is TV excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and was photographed beautifully in black and white, which is almost noir style film with deep images and stark shadows. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil it. It is a rare display of what homosexuals face in the 1960s in America. Authored by Tom Pettit wonderful, and directed Ganot Hoark great, moving through their lives and their love for each other and their tragedy. Facing such a sensitive issue makes this episode very spectacular. Our emotions are torn and on the edge like characters. Chills ran in the end when he played the role of Bob Dylan's wonderful, "Ah, but I was much older then, I'm younger than that now," as he sang Birds. This one goes beyond 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
