When I first heard that Hull Hartley was an orphan to Henry Fowl, I was enthusiastic (this has been a personal favorite for years now), and then I was careful when I heard it was terrorism. After I just saw him, I was surprised when I found that he succeeded, with it still being a completely different kind of Henry Bean film. Writing and direction faded, and the acting was great. Special attention moved to Hartley to reassemble the actors almost entirely, to Henry's son, who was just four years old. As I said, however, this film is quite different from the first film, but it works: I reconciled with the change in tone and theme of the fact that 10 years have passed and you will find the same characters in very different positions since the end of the first film. In this case, it entails an unexpected adventure ... and that is all I will give ... not to mention the fact that I will need to see it again to understand the reality of what is going on and who is multiplying with who. While it was certainly one of the best films I have seen in some time, it suffers like many sequences with its end, as Hartley seems to be planning a third film now and leaves the film hanging. I will be sure to buy my ticket for part 3 ("Henry Grim"?) In 2017.
