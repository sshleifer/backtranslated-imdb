finally!!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting for this film to appear for about a year, and finally I saw it at the premiere in SB. I met some actors, who were really nice and were wonderful in the film. I've seen the trailer so many times that I did not know what I was expecting, but it was completely absorbed. The movie was really nice to consider and the music was also good. I recommend it to anyone who likes Ryan Donowho, and Dominic Sween was good at it too. Other actors were also good great. I hope it will be on DVD soon !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first got Ryan watching the OC and then I saw him in a group of good indians like Imaginary Heroes. It's wonderful in this film, and everything he does is independent. I also love Dominique but I have not seen her as much. Hope to see them both sooner!
