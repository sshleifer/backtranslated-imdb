I read somewhere (in a fairly comprehensive review) that this is something of a live mica anime and I think they are on the right lines. I watched this movie for the first time when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally did, all the memories came back. I do not think this should be taken seriously - it's just part of a nearly 80-year-old series almost as well as a TV movie (set against a somewhat dark future, although this is not too much compressed). What I liked most about this film was that the dialogue was not a general voice - no cliches or predictable lines - all in very good fun! Maybe it was not a nice time with this little movie, but I still can appreciate it. It's not perfect at all, but it's entertaining and not trying to be anything else. Let obsessed and comic men worry about technical matters - who cares? See it for yourself and make your decision. No one else's opinion.
