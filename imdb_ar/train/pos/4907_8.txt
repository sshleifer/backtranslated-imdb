This somewhat strange show is a good, creative and clich√©-free production that tells the story of an intimate friendship that develops between a man and a boy under conditions that are less than perfect: the fugitive convicted fugitive who kidnapped the youth in his favor. The value as a hostage. Directed by Alan Gibson with a good experience of balanced narrative movement, the film provides freshness in almost every scene. Philon Martin Stichert (Richard Harris) believes that his refusal to parole is particularly undesirable, opposing a twisted but eventually successful escape plan, His spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lake house in his childhood. Often a sticker explodes in the song or dances a few steps away, gradually gaining the trust and passion of his prisoner. As the police approach an inevitable confrontation, the bound pair is seen as a large part of their response to forms of rejection, as evidenced by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner ) Was appointed to help an excited police lieutenant (James Coburn) in charge of Stackert's hunt and "jailing". This is an attractive, admirable story, a fast-paced new adventure that takes advantage of the performance of the VC Harris, and turns from Wagner, Cobren, and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as a kid kidnap, with an eccentric degree appropriately contributed by Wilfred Josephs, First Frank Watts, with all the footage filmed in beautiful autumn Ontario.
