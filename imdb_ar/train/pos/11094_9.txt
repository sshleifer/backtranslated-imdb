This film spots and courage delivers consistently. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most disrespectful films, and he's the best adaptation of Elmor Leonard so far (and if you scratch your head thinking "but I loved getting SHORTY," you have to trust your face). In my opinion, no one embodies the "feeling" of Leonard's characters better than John Glover's 52 PICK-UP. Moving the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) raises the chaos factor in the story to spectacular heights. Be a man, take some beer and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My Frankenheimer films include my favorite II and II candidate. I also have a real special place in the cold heart of DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
