I love this movie has been so well! Great acting, drama and historically accurate. I love the films of Rumi Schneider. These rocks are not as big as Sisi but they are still rocks! <br /> <br /> The Scorpiolina, commented the French dubbing. Well this is originally a German film and not a French. So yes. Second, there was a conspiracy, perhaps not familiar with history. Oh and her mother played the role of the nanny, not her teacher. In fact, it was not the story of Cinderella but Queen Victoria, and perhaps you missed those details. <br /> <br /> However, the history in this film is wonderful, I love historical films, and Queen Victoria is so wonderful! I love all the historical things. Such a man who was trying to manipulate her mother. When she fled, she met her future husband and showed her "a new kind of dance." When the waltz was new, I considered it somewhat scandalous because the couples were dancing very much. Yes, her nanny was like my God! <br /> <br /> Also clothes, I love clothes. Wonderful styles, gorgeous collar skirts. And of course Rumi always looks pretty pretty.
