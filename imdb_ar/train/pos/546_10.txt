I think it was one of the best results I've seen in a while. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted to die someone, and Stanley was killed by the wonderful nagging characters. It was so good a film that you were happy when you died. My only problem was in some scenes, it was like someone with a home camera that he was pictured and was strange. Good Nelson's presence, in my opinion at least was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Wonderful movie.
