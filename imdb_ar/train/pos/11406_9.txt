This very strange setting for Wagner's latest opera certainly grew on me. When I first saw her, I was somewhat disturbed by many surreal films, and I felt that much had been imposed on the story. However, if you can afford quite a bit of "recherch√© tricks", I think you'll find that the film can not capture the other very exotic opera atmosphere in the opera, and that there are special moments well. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not really understand Coder's role until I saw how her image was Edith Cleaver. Her performance (the simultaneous silent representation of Lyon Minton's vocals) is no less than dazzling, from end to end, and justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for the joy of this film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's stunning interpretation of Gormans' crucial role, the role played by Lloyd in the role of opera all over the world. I have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of Gormans on the Metropolitan Opera Theater several times, his loss of voice, and the warm warmth of his interpretation of this noble character, as is already the case. Performance in two of the main monologues of the character, the scene of Karfreitag and the recounting of prophecy in Chapter 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a video designed for America, and so there were translations, unfortunately, that could not be eliminated. This is particularly unfortunate because the translation used is too inaccurate and imposes a very Christian interpretation on a film that already imposes layers of interpretation on the opera. This seemed to me quite inconsistent with Wagner's apparent avoidance of Christianity, and his very deliberate attempt to "mainstream" Christian elements into the story. (See the footnote with the spoiler at the end of this review.) I find it almost impossible, when viewing a movie that contains subtitles, to keep it from being comprehensible, and strongly recommend that, in DVD versions, you have the ability to run subtitles. Stop, you do it, instead, if the opera is unfamiliar to you, then you are reading libretto in advance. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there is a lot in the film that I do not like, and it will be just as I saw it done in a different way ... but it has steadily risen in my estimation over the years since I first saw it, Repeatedly. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTE containing a spoiler: A good example of this is the famous Kundry line, "I've seen it ... is ... and laughed." This is translated, in translation, for reasons that survived me, where "I saw the face of the Savior." It is particularly disturbing to me, because throughout the library, Wagner refers deliberately and carefully to this invisible character who does not need to be Jesus the Bible "Highland Monastery", that is, the German "healer" - in reference to the wound of Amfortas , To all wounds, diseases and the need for healing.
