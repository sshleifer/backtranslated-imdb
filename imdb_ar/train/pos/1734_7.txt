I saw this movie for the first time ever and I loved it. Her dance was very amusing. I read somewhere that she got a role in this film because she knows how to dance. The scene was very impressive. Yvonne is a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at ridiculous kissing scenes, but this is a wonderful thing in old movies! I grew up with The Munsters and I enjoy watching them in her previous films. They may not all be the best, but they still deserve to be seen to watch and sing. I am slowly buying all her films and watching them and I receive them. I have a large collection of memorabilia.
