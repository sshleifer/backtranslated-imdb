I enjoyed singing and dancing with Frank Frank Sinatra and General Kelly, as well as Catherine Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won the Oscar for the George E. Stoll Award, nominations for best film, Kelly's best actor, best cinematography and best film for "I Fall in Love Too Easily" Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful story about helping Kelly and his colleague Sinatra get a girl and fall in love with her himself. The beautiful Grayson (Tost New Orleans) stunned us with her singing, and we had a lot of wonderful, rhythmic songs by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the art of pianist Jose Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Classic Hollywood music from an era gone by.
