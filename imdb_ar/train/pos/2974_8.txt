This film is excellent pace, you will never have to wait until your belly laugh for more than a minute and there is much more than the initial premise of the movie. Through it, there is a mockery of the traditional traditional type of schmaltzy by experienced boys to overcome adversity, which is a parody. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughs just by using vices; - Sure, there is a lot of it, but all this is not contextual or unjustified. I loved this movie and it cost me only Â£ 2.99 on a DVD, so in terms of entertainment value for money, it was the best film I've seen this year.
