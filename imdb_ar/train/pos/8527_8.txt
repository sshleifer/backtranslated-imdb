Just allow me to reach the minimum here: I have three children between the ages of 5 and 10 years. Take a trip to the theater successful when there are no talking animals. I've watched most of the children's videos in our group at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film is reflected in The Wizard of Oz, the sexual humor of more than 18 years in El Dorado and the tragic flaws at the end of Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer. Maybe I can tell the story of Nemo's story from memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my only child (different) who suggests this title for a family movie from an evening? In one word: Shauberman. <br /> <br /> Moments of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
