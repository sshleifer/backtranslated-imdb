"Written on the Wind" is Melodrama Douglas Circus. Douglas Circus was rediscovered through Cahiers du Cinema, Fassbinder, etc. Which he praised as a major director - I believe that due to the evolution of his cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers brilliant color images and wonderful decorations. . But I ask myself: Is this enough to carry a film? "Written on the Wind" ranges from weak to fair (except for Robert Stack - he is convinced that he is a weak and corrupt playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually having a strong screen, is wrong in this film. Dorothy Malone as a glamorous, "carefree femme fatale" is fine, but lacks the necessary strength for this role. Rock Hudson is efficient but empty. <br /> <br /> The plot contains very interesting components. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> His alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (not loved by the beloved father) <br /> <br /> Frustrated by his daughter Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, a former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought up with Kyle and loved by the patriarch . <br /> <br /> Secrets behind the door, love triangle, frustration, battles, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was in the handles. My mistake! why? I will try to explain: "Writing on the Wind" takes itself very seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before acting, in general, is not good enough - density does not exist. There are many powerful scenes in the story, but actors are only doing effective work. I think these scenes may have been fully explored with Italian or Spanish actors - they will end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> The rest of us is a beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
