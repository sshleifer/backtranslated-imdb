I thought that Hugh O'Connor was amazing in the role of young Christie Brown, and really deserved a greater appreciation for his role. I could not believe how he played a good role. Of course, Daniel Dae Lewis was very impressive. My favorite scene is where boys play football and Christie uses his head to turn off the goals and then kick the penalty! Amazing offers by two Christie's (and others too).
