I saw this movie when it was first released. It was an official choice for the Timecula Valley International Film Festival and voted for it as the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justin Priestley was as warm as Amanda's mental but complex. This is not your normal psychological film. Lots of interesting and original tendencies on this genre. A kind of "killer attraction" for the younger with a combination of mixed blues blues where Amanda's passion theme is married to the upcoming blues singer who has less time for her husband as she begins her career. <br /> <br />
