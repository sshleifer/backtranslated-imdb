****** WARNING: May contain spoilers ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "masked men?" Simply, Mystery Men is a group of sub-heroes who desperately try to live the lives of their adolescent imagination while controlling their true identity and super-identities. Shoveller (Bill Macy) works in construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and children at home while walking the street in search of crimes to tackle him in his unique style in shovel shovel fighting. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells the silver pots to the bridegrooms during the day and flies on the tableware in the villages of the crackers at night, if his mother does not keep him busy with the latest parasitism. The angry Mr. works in an undesirable arena to earn his salary, then comes out of his frustration at his friends at night, and throws at one of the thinkers in his friend and his enemy alike and threatens to get really angry (leaving everyone wondering, what?). Ben Stiller blows this life into this character, you can only love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they dreamed of ... to become real superheroes. Obviously, it can happen. Champion City has an amazing captain, after all ... a pilot, a big assassin with corporate slogans on his uniform to stop a bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns into a great performance as a middle-aged salesman trying to catch the attention of his fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To restore this "extra magic" that might win back support, C.A. Releases Casanova Frankenstein, the superpower WAAAAAY threat played by Jeffrey Rush. This crazy genius has created a "psychologically simulated" to maim the hero city into a reflection of his madness ... and ends up grabbing C.A. Within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the mysterious men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with followers like Disco Boys who protect Frankenstein, the trio will need little help. <br /> <br /> The recruitment begins, and after a painful recruitment ceremony, the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her own mystical bowling ball that seems passionate about the reprisal spirit of her dead father; The hidden boy (Kel Mitchell), who demands to turn invisible when no one is ever seen; the spleen (Paul Robbins), given a strong internal bulge of angry Gypsies; and the much-spaced Wes Studi To cut the guns in half with his mind, then spends the bulk of the rest of the film, uttering the amazing puzzles and acting more than the Punch. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually a multi-genre category. Anyone wanting to pour into the movies hole in neat small classes is locked in a losing battle. This spoof / parody of the supernatural type - from pseudo-recycled Burton sets to infinity (and sometimes decorated with more parody material) to ridiculous fashion, gets this type of comic book to send very well. But at the same time, the superhero flick is serious, as well. Both at once. Although it is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film reflects in some way the short-lived Devix Comics works), but is largely innovative for the big screen. It presents a comic book world that requires the suspension of disbelief to accept it anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if the superheroes are real, so these guys will be real. If Big Guy with S is flying around New York City, you'll see half a dozen news reports about idiots in underwear while kicking them regularly. Sure, the Shoveller fights well, and the Blue Raja throws thorns with great precision - all over the world the supernatural hero. But does this make them real heroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark film. Inescapable, when trying to point out the ridiculous nature of the patent of superlatives. The lines fly while the geniuses on the stage cast out many bits to play. A particularly fascinating dialogue is Janine Garofalo with a bowling ball / her father. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of separate laughter or jokes that are unforgettable forever. It mixes a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never integrates into any of them. <br /> <br /> What makes "masked men" really a good film, in the end, is that it's participating. In the end, the weak / lame players are finally justified, and for a bright moment, they become great heroes; justice is achieved; the film ends with a scene that shines with realism (as realistic as possible in a world where bowling balls and glasses are in perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to name the movie, the movie can be a big hit. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no perfect film. Claire Forlani comes in a state of boredom and lack of interest as Mr. Furious loves love, despite having a pivotal role as his conscience. Tom Whites seems somehow confused by his own lines as a crazy inventor, Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes that capture retired women in the nursing home are worth seeing on their own. The villagers are never more than armed arms (a point is made in the film). Cinematography is dashed and disjointed (as it happens in the average comic book, so it is an excuse), sometimes the music beat the scene, and the special effects are not fully integrated into the rest well. <br /> <br /> However, overall, this film is incredible. Maybe you have to be a comedian and super hero type to appreciate this movie really, but it is fun fun and a good way to kill a few hours and leave your mind resting. <br /> <br /> 8/10 In my opinion.
