My grandmother bought me this film when I was five (I always loved scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story is original and entertaining. I especially like the scenes where an RV is being attacked in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low budget flick. Representation is above average for these kinds of exotic music films. This is definitely a jewel uder rating. I recommend it to anyone who likes these exotic films from the late 1970s, early 1980s such as Alice, Sweet Alice, Poor Pretty Eddie, Nightmare, Massacre, Return of the Aliens, The Deadly Egg. Definitely classic!
