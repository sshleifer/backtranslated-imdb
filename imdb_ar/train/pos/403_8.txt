I remember the Legend of Zu trailer was great and as a fan of A Man Called Hero (my favorite all the time), Storm Riders decided to watch this video too. I know there's a way to get a lot of criticism about Ekin Cheng's ability to act everywhere, but he's my favorite character in Hong Kong so far (better than Nicholas Tse), one of the factors I enjoyed in this film. There is no doubt that this film is a work of art from start to finish. So I thought that the actors are just the real ones and that everything else is the computer that was created by the end of this movie. They must have a lot of work in this one and they deserve a good credit for it. The story of the film was a fictional story between good and evil with a love story thrown (I think Ekin Cheng attracts girls easily). The story is not very intellectual and deep but that's not what you expect when watching Action. I wished there were more martial arts with a fist and a fist than battles with magical abilities, but that's life and not going what you want. And why do they look like supersonic planes in the battle in the sky in the end? This is a very funny way. Legend of Zu can not be "a man called a hero" in my eyes but it flows like a video game and this is not bad at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie, I will not be surprised because it holds all elements of video games. good job. Please provide more fantasy movies like this
