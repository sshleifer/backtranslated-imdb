Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, intimate, and totally loved it! Everyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes wished to return to the "good old days" briefly needed to really see this day! Begins 20 years later, and returns from the old camp to "reunion". I will not comment on the plot anymore because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great and had all the cast stars. Everyone played a great role. I really felt that you were part of the film I saw. Alan Arkin was good at his role as a client. It plays the role of the man that everyone wants in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this one to anyone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
