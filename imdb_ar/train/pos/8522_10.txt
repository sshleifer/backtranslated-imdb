I found this show really late at night and I have tried it. It is a refreshing change from other types of things that appear late at night, if caught next to me. Its simplicity in values ​​and the sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as a child. It's something I occupy when I find it (this is rare, maybe I should check the lists! Haha) ..... The tension between Joe and Nick is very nice. Like any good chick flick, you're really emotionally involved in characters. Good ol 'Louisa May Alcott still inspires good stories :) So, it seems I have to complete 10 lines of text so that my opinion is valid, so I think I'll tell you a bit more. Children are played by talented actors and actresses, the settings are beautiful and full of nature - something else you do not see much on TV. I hope everyone gives him one shot. I realize I realize he is happy, but he is kind. As I said before, it's refreshing.
