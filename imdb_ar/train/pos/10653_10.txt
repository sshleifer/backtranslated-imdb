I know it's common now to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of horror movies including Haunting's original 1963 film as well as most of the hammer films. This film is not constrained and does not seem to hinder it at all, which is why many modern viewers seem like they do not like it. However, many viewers can accept movies out of control like Scream because knife killers are more easily believed by most people than demons or ghosts. In fact, this film had many wonderful scenes and the acting and special effects were fantastic. I have seen it 15 times and improved every time. The director of this film made a number of interesting and elegant films and was not trying to achieve the realism of the sixth sense. Haunting lets go and certainly not boring. Perhaps this film has attracted more to John Carpenter's fans but more of the traditional conspiracy structure. The old Haunting was also a great film since 1963. It was more scary. See both The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
