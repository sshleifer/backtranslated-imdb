Chris Rock starred in a new edition of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (a new version of the 1941 film here, Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams and adventures in his life . A new body (though temporary). In my home version, the protagonist was a back-up player for Ramses. In Rock's Hipper's release, our main character is a struggling young comedy - and low talent - <br /> <br /> It is very funny to see a sharp rock shave playing a bad comedy. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks acting as a bad actor. The dream of Lance Barton is to play the legendary Apollo theater in a non-amateur night. But every time he tries to experiment with his material, he was so disgusted by the theater that his nickname becomes "Booie." His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is all that is not a real Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a cycling messenger, riding the streets on his way to experience more items at BAM! He collided with a truck. Well, so maybe he took his body ten seconds early by a somewhat incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to be beaten anyway. We do not respond, it seems that Lance is not worthy of paradise until 2044. What is the work? Mr. King (Chaz Palmenti), "Director" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for Mr. Barton who is not dead. The problem is that the body they find is a big white greedy man. It turns out that this novel (Mr. Wellington) has all kinds of things - he's the richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will change things. <br /> <br /> But, of course, while in the wealthy Mr. Wellington, Lance is in a wonderful place in the hospital (Regina King). We males know how hard it is to find a female looking at our body, but try to win one while you are an old white guy! It is worse when you are not affected by your money. <br /> <br /> This is the first rock shot in a leading role, and I think it performs admirably. There's still a lot of stand-up comedian in it - and of course, if he's ever going to get a variety of roles, he might have to stop integrating script readiness - but that's not really bad. Rock character - his leadership, his delivery, his behavior, his passion - are what feed this film. He obviously has a lot of fun in this role and seems determined to make sure you enjoy watching him.
