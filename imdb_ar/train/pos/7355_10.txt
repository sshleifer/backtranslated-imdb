For a low budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who starred in the television program "Dragnet", has become more sexual than ever before. The locations were perfect for plot plotting, and the director shows his talent by taking over several roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget film can use better editing transitions and more special effects for Venetian scenes, but music keeps this text moving. Although this film contains a part of the problems, such as continuity, I must say that I will rent the next film to the director. If you are a student, you can learn some things from the director's commentary.
