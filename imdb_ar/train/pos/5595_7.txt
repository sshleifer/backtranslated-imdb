Polanski returns to the themes of isolation and insanity that he has explored to this enormous influence in Repression and Rosemary Pepe, in The Tennant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a Polanski brand - dark, bosom, scary - but there's something embarrassing about this film, and I'm not sure whether it's intentional or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nikvist, who was in charge of some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not do justice here. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a bit disappointed by the few truly impressive film filming in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really lets the film down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can with the hard role Trylkovsky plays. Some of the support team is fantastic, especially Melvin Douglas such as the owner and Shelley Winters, the calconers, but others are weak and miscast. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American dialects. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, there are wonderful moments of dark comedy in the movie. Everyone who saw The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is definitely a good comedian. However, there are moments when they slide dangerously from being a spoof to themselves. It is likely that the sudden "transformation" of Trelkovsky (and somewhat unjustified) laughs over the eyebrows, which detracts from what should have been a strong moment in his psychological drama journey. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Tenant is an interesting and interesting experience, if it is too weak for its benefit. There are a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and an uncomfortable atmosphere, but this film, though very good, has not been as successful as it could have been. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of the day, Polanski's "Best" is still better than most other "good" films. Definitely worth watching, do not expect to be blown up.
