There are great details in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The movie looks great and the animation sometimes drops the jaw. The film is not terribly original, it's basically a modern film about the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa, with only errors. I enjoyed the personal interaction but the villains in this film actually look bad. It seems that Disney usually makes carbon copy scraps of bad guys. The grasshoppers are threatened, and Hopper, the leading bad man, was a wonderful creature. Check this one out.
