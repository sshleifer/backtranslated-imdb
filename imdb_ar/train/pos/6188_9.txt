The murder investigation continues late, while The Vanities, on the opening night, plays an unknown audience. The strange combination of musical mystery and murder deserves to find the crew, production numbers and absolute modernity of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael plays a dazzling role for an attractive actress aiming to stop marriage. Among the stars of the show, Kitty Carlyle and Carl Bresson, as well as the famous "Sweet Mariguana" (which was also in the Beit Meidler album in the seventies). So, as the chorus girls roam around the scenes, interrogator Victor McLaglin seduces the girls while trying to solve the murder of an unknown woman behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Steckney) loves Brisson from a distance, that the wardrobe lady (Jesse Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and the theater director (Jack Okay) makes fun of everything. Plenty of intrigue develops between musical numbers. The most famous song in the show is "cocktails for two people". Kitty Carlyle also sings "Where did they come from?" A strange bafflement explodes in the Harlem specialty number featuring the Duke of Ellington! Quite a cast. <br /> <br /> Some great acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Steckney. Kitty Carlyle is very good as well. Bresson is the total zero point. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Mick plays the role of a doctor, and finds out if you can discover Anne Sheridan and Lucille Paul among the showgirls.
