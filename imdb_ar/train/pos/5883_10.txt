I watched, mesmerized and fascinated, through vocal and physical representation. The roles played by each character were performed with distinction. She told me all the words and the words of the nod and the sunrise in everything. He has enlightened me to a different perception of the person who believes in humanity. Whoever believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also detained in disbelief, and sacrifices and human dignity were portrayed. Power without grace, is malice and without feelings. Want power on the expense of humanity, so incredible it. This film has made me very afraid of people who have not returned in this world. I think of them sadly. I love this movie for conversations and facial expressions for everyone. May bless this film.
