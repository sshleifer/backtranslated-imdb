We first saw this film as part of a new Argentine film festival in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we loved it, we did not think it was exceptional. When we saw it for the second time, we found a different meaning in this view of life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film is shown in one of Argentina's darkest days, as the DeLaRua administration is over. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished early in the 1990s, under an artificial climate created President Minin. It was time when bank accounts were frozen in dollars and people became living a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins perfectly when Santamarina, a bank employee, is separated because of the collapse of the economy. Instead of getting sympathy from his wife, they shut him out of the apartment and become a homeless man for all practical purposes. He goes out to the streets trying to meet his needs. <br /> <br /> The other story is presented to us by Ariel, a young Jew who interviewed an Spanish company. It's almost a miracle to get a job. His father Simon has a small restaurant in the El-Marra Jewish quarter in the city center. Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother suddenly dies. Only Estella, the young woman who loves Ariel, comes to help the father and the son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, a clean man, must take a shower wherever he can. Choose a ladies room at one of the metro stations. When you find the companion, Elsa, naked, become angry, but she turns to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They get involved in a romantic relationship, and Santamarina finds one of his trips through the garbage in the streets a baby. Elsa, while surprised, wanted to do the right thing. But Santamrina convinces her that innocent life in their lives will strengthen their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met Laura at work, begins a turbulent sexual relationship with his beautiful working partner, whom he does not know, who is involved in an affair. Ariel, who liberates the spears by filming weddings and other events, feels eager for Laura, but he knows what Estella has sacrificed to help his father and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "Partido" we thought was excellent, is a wonder with this film. Things are put in perspective after a recent re-watch and we must apologize for not recognizing her at the first time. There was nothing, for the second time, in which the nuances of the screen were shown by Mr. Bormann and Emiliano Torres, because they were more logical because they reflected the turmoil of the country during those dark days. Daniel Hendler, who He plays with Ariel, who has collaborated with Mr. Bormann before, to achieve surprising results: he is not a "beautiful movie star," but he is handsome. Enrique Bainero is another wonderful surprise: Santamarina's boss takes over, despite all the bad things he has done, he keeps a rosy attitude towards everyone he meets The Italian actress Stefania Sandrilli made a wonderful contribution to the film with Elsa. One of the best Argentine actors, is the small part of Simon, who is seen as the brilliant Kiara Coselli in the image of Laura and Melina Petrilli as the noble Stella. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" prove that Daniel Burman is a voice that is counted in Argentine cinema.
