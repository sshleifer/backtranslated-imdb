Warning: Contains spoiler. Horny conspiracy and in many cases terrible representation. Fontaine is wonderful, but others, especially Richard Nye, Efe's husband, are extremely wooden. Ney lies in bed, and dies of arsenic poisoning, with each hair in place. After the film is very juicy and very exciting. More fulfillment of the book than most of his era films. The portrayal of Joan Fontaine Ksama (a prostitute, was shocking then - I'm not joking, kids) was a wonderful hit. It's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. The killers were also supposed to die with "feet above all in the ground in an empty place."
