This film is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social injustice and hypocrisy. But it was very funny. Much lighter than the dark and dangerous exit of the chamber (my favorite Iranian film). The trick of the girls and the joke between them and the soldiers was quite reasonable (as if it were a documentary) and quite funny. <br /> <br /> The actual match and its aftermath were amazing. I have added an incident very similar to an Australian Kenyan, of course a completely different film. <br /> <br /> Offers from all non-professional representatives? Soldiers and girls? They were very reliable. It was very moving to see the passion and disappointment of these girls. Anyone in this country thinks that Muslim girls who wear chadors differ from their daughters, should they watch the film ?? It would be a real editorial. <br /> <br /> To me, the soldiers were the current model. They have started with standard official policy responses to all girls' requests. As the film progressed, they found it more difficult to maintain this position. When what seems like all of Tehran erupts into a brutal celebration, everyone is caught up in it, and the current politics are blunt and clear to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected ending, and the film gave a truly wonderful mix of emotions, excitement, drama and social commentary. Although it is an adult cinema, I think that mature children of about seven will really appreciate this film (as long as they can read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is wonderful that a repressive state such as Iran is capable of producing such films by the likes of Panahi and Kyarostami. Perhaps the constraints there force managers to be very resourceful. Australian filmmakers (and others) can take out a paper from their book.
