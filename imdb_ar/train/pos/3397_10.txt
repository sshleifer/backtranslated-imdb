Soylent Green IS ... really good movie. <br /> <br /> I never thought about that. I do not really like Houston in his scientific endeavors. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manage all the irony and invincibility most of the time. I prefer weak champions. Indeed, he is shaking his way through so many Soylent Green, too, but since he is supposed to play an overly trusting role, I do not really mind. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people run their noses up in this movie. Soylent Green does not make any effort at all to create futuristic images (what do you know - looks exactly like 1973), and lacks work. But I was impressed with the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and very classy society, and I was very pleased to see that Edward J. Robinson had a busy and funny role. Nice personal moments - such as when sharing some precious food with Houston - really make the film. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is relevant these days, when it seems that no one knows what the right government or companies are up to. Funny, is not it, to see Heiston in the film Michael Moore Model ...
