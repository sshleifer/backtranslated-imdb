Victor Nunes depicts this non-emotional story of a young woman's emotional journey with a feeling of poetry rarely appearing in the cinema. I mean poetry the meaning of literature and cinema. There is something very literary about the film, as if the novel has been adapted page by page. In this sense, the film achieves depth that many can not; but it is also a bit slow at other times, undermining the depths of the past in favor of ennui. Movie star Ashley Jude did not make a better film than her first appearance here. It fits the role of the bullet Ruby as a glove, as if she did not have to act. She has a real presence for the film's star in the film, and has not really succeeded in conveying the same attraction in her later films, although she was fantastic in Normal Life.
