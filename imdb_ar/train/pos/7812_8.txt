A long film about a very important figure from South Africa, Stephen Pico. He is one of those blacks who have not survived apartheid, and who have already died long before their normal time. The old film does not really show how important Pico really is. His life is reduced and taught to little, at best a few witty observations. The film was from 1987, and the goal was to push South Africa to the brink of a cliff that would lead to liberation. So the film aims to show the rationality of apartheid supporters in South Africa, in 1987. To show this film we must look beyond Pico's death and therefore to focus her speech not on Pico but on a liberal white journalist and his escape from the absurdity of the system in which he lives. His escape was necessary because of the victimization of his family and because he wanted to publish the first book about Pico after his death, and this could only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape from South Africa, while apartheid still exists and is killed. So do not expect this method to be realistic and correct. it can not be. But the film has grown enormously because it does not show South Africa any historical dimension, the dimension that took place under the presidency of Nelson Mandela, which is called forgiveness provided that those who want to forgive and speak speak. The film is strong and emotional but this very historical limit makes it somewhat weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third ethnic community, the Indians. All observable books or films are flawed: they look at the person who is supposed to portray them from a single point of view. This explains why the film has progressed in age and seems to have come a long time, as if nothing has changed at all. A new restructuring is needed. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Collardieu, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin en Evelyn, CEGID
