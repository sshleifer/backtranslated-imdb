If there is ever an inspirational story that can move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere in spite of the odds and make them (even when "make it" as an appropriate expression, it can have a broad berth representing a personal fact in the end) It is. It's a film that's hard to see at times: seeing the less calm aspects of Christie Brown's character appear in two major scenes - one when her sister announces that she is pregnant and about to get married while his father is having a bad reaction, and at a table dinner when the woman is there, To communicate effectively, has now announced in an important moment (the inauguration of the art of Brown) and is about to marry another man - difficult. It is so much more difficult because this is the man who can not react according to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: through screaming, screaming and abusive words aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of heartache and dysfunction of the family even when a large part of it presents a biographical account, but the story of a man who overcomes a severe handicap, becomes an active person and a force to be reckoned with in the world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won the Oscars for his strong and unforgettable performance such as Kristy Brown's misguidance and perseverance, and Brenda Fricker did her supporting role as strong mother Brown.
