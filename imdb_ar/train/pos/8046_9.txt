Who knew it could be funny? Christopher Miloney and Janell Muloney know their remarkable work in some of the most dramatic dramas on television. ("Law and Order: SVU" and "West Wing") Put them together on the big screen and what you get is an attractive romantic comedy with lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> The actors constantly develop the story with an impressive skill, leaving the audience bound to love with Barry Singer (Melony), although he is a comedian in the standby mode, and it happens to be a sexually excited jerk. <br /> <br /> You'll be rooted in him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases Thea (Muloney) halfway across the country hoping to win her heart. They have little in common ... but when Barry finally opens his heart, you'll wonder why Thia is still running away. <br /> <br /> Souler Opposite is a great film with great actors and talented writers. Well worth your time. <br /> <br />
