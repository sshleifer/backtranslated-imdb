When I took my seat in the cinema, I was in a great mood and did not plan to change it. But this film is a tremendous force. I was in sweat and I needed to shower afterwards. So what do we have? In theory, an upcoming story of a young Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It comes to my mind soon that the plot looks completely borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we were taken to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding in Kung Fu. We also have a love story and a contest. Having accepted this, this fact turned into an emotional drama sweeping her and showing some beautiful kung fu music (I am not an expert). The main actress Simra Turan is not only the champion of Denmark, but she also offers excellent performance, so it seems safe to assume that we have some autobiographical impressions here bearing in mind that this is her first film and that she does not have any film education as an actress. The rest of the cast is fine, good camera, intense kung fu. Sidenotes: - The Turkish public showed respectful males so that they must do something right. - The audience burst into cheers when a heroine finally responded and attacked the boys who were beating her brother hard in retaliation. - Xian Gao, Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon, played a leading role <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see it in the cinema, you may have a good and intense experience and I do not know if This works on a small screen as well
