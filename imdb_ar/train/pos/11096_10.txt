Based on the film Elmore Leonard, this action film is violent and intelligent. The story: A businessman was blackmailed by about 3 criminals. Roy Cheddar is doing a great job where the leading character and credit needs to go to John Glover, who plays some kind of naughty psychiatrist. I must mention that bad characters are very complex and interesting - something very rare for Action. Also features some beautiful women and stimulants - most notably Kelly Preston is the young sedition of Cheddar. Vanity performs well and looks well as the three extortion hooks. I am pleased to say that Anne Margaret has not yet lost her - this is a real babe. Do not look at the rate of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics are facing against this film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this film that really controls the rating. You will enjoy it, this is a promise. Recommended A +.
