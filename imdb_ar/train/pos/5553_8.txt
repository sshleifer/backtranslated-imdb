A slow but beautiful story mounted on the American Revolution. Griffith's story is much less heavy than in his previous historical epic, and the works of his paintings are fully integrated into the work. Lionel Barrymore is an absolute pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but dashing and Carol Dempster is ... Well, Carol Dempster is the most wrong in Griffith in this period, but it does not often show enough to slow the pace and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the trivia of the film says it originally came in just over two hours when it was released for the first time, but there is no failure lasting longer than 90 minutes. However, the DVD version was displayed at a slower rate per second, increasing the tension and returning it to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in telling stories rather than audio versions, such as audio versions, such as Patriot. Although this is not good in the best journals for Griffiths, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, it is an excellent way to spend a few hours.
