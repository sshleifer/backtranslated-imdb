As one IMDB reviewer noted, this film begins very slowly, but it improves significantly with its advance. Yes, it was released by Roger Corman, and yes, it skips some of the same subject matter as high budget predators such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the rapprochement between the wife's career as a rising singer in the face of marital union and his quasi-Freudian need to fill the emotional "emptiness" or "gap" while away with the intelligent use of minimal influences and settings work well. Using a very small number of sites and characters, and also using water in almost every scene as a figurative symbol of disinfection and dumping all over, this film, although clearly suffering from a very meager budget, reminds me in many ways of more full awareness and a more recent scenario, It is the French film "SWIMMING POOL" which seems to me at least may have borrowed some useful ideas from "UP against AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, the UP against AMANDA keeps it thrilling through a deadly ruthless look to give away some sensational temptations sometimes, but it does it as well or better as other films in this genre. The development of Amanda's husband's abuse of Amanda in the past (again, very Freudian) is also unique in this genre and enjoyable. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected reaction and sympathy for Amanda's plight this aspect of the story raises. The cast is excellent and I think. <br /> <br />
