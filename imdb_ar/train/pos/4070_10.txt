I know anime. I have been in it before long became a national phenomenon. I liked Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And to know that I'm not proud of me, let me say this: Of all the cartoons I've seen, Castle in the Sky is one of the best games. Obviously people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people know this movie just because it is one Acedmy Award. This is not an exaggeration - I have offered Princess Mononoke and a castle in the sky to people who have never seen Spirited Away at all, and agreed that the latter two are the three chiefs. Personally, I never thought that anything could compare with Mononoke, until I finally saw a castle in the sky. I still think the above is the best between the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily equated with it; in many ways, Castle has key elements Mononoke has been missing. In both cases, if you had just watched Spirited Away, I thought that this was the best film for Miyazaki, so I scrambled to shake the ground.
