I will start by saying that this has been collected by almost everyone! The truth is that it was not what anyone expected, especially from Jay Ritchie. What everyone expected was the Cockney festivals and one good linens. "Do you like the glamor?" Etc., but this is more mature than his previous works. I agree that it is puzzling, but all the facts exist for us, we just have to see them and listen more, this film requires all your attention! Look at the past through the wonderful appearance of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admiration for the performance and I think we will all get a more comprehensive understanding of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has the influences of modern classics (Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc.) but it is originally fully in both directions and speed with an unmatched degree of music. I feel that if everyone sees this movie again and again, they will understand it a lot and may appreciate it on the wonderful piece of modern cinema. I also hope that Ritchie will continue to do so in vain because I prefer this to a great extent on my masterpiece "Masterpieces".
