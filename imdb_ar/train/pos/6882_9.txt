I have not seen the film yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems interesting and inspiring. It has been one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions I've really raised and made me think of, the unique way of boxing as a metaphor for "battle inside" have stopped me ... Thank God someone hit another angle with the boxing thing. This movie looks very new and smart. The actor is really spicy. I particularly enjoyed the short cut with the actor from the Rocky movies, really clever. I thought that the chosen topic - overcoming adversity and childhood trauma - is unbearable, and God knows that many people need it. bring it.
