Peach is really a wonderful film. I am writing this to refute the review of a person named "Auscrit", which appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that Monahans first film "The Interview" is a television in an exceptional way. This is a worldwide acclaimed film, one of the best Australian films ever made. It is well worth winning the best picture. Peach is a brave, bold and courageous exit. For me, it works on every level and I've seen it twice now. The film director's animosity shows great skill and incredible sensitivity. For "Auscrit" to comment on it as another TV movie and so on and that Hugo Weaving is not good, simply "do not get" the movie. Or in particular does not want to get it. Frankly this is the type of comment one would expect from another filmmaker who feels jealous or bitter or both. Or anyone from within the industry, either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average gambler, I just found do not write comments like that. I noticed other comments on the site and referred to Sommersault. One has to wonder what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released, the payment was, if you did not like it, something went wrong in the movie. This manipulation of the media is very common down. The truth is that the only similarity between the two films is that they are the rights of traffic films. Unfortunately for me, SS film about nothing, it could be said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Peach in comparison is a key piece. Personally I can not wait until what Monahan does then, as he progresses clearly on any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all at the AFI and IF awards this year, it is a fake game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive with your time
