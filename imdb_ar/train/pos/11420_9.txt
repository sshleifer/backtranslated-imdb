This film revolves around the accuracy and difficulty of moving in the ever-changing boundaries of ethnicity, ethnic relations and desire. Granted, it is not a film for everyone. There are no car chases, no buildings explode, no murder. The drama lies in the tension suggested by the looks, the minimum gestures, the spatial boundaries, the lighting and the remaining things - very apparent - unpaid. It is about identity, memory, society and belonging. The different parts of the film work together to promote the dominant ideas about self and others, identity, desire, boundaries and loss. The viewer will reward attentive and sensitive. Those who require their taste will irritate the work of an explosive, broad, spicy. It is a beautifully photographed human story. That's it.
