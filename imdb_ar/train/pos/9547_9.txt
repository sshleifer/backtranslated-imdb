This film is the first cinematic experience for several people in the team. They are all well-known actors and have played in numerous television series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well known comedian in Turkey. It is strange to see him in an exciting film, which is at the height of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot of Togan Gokbakar and is the first experience to a large extent as a director. But they all did a good job. We are happy to see such a young enthusiastic cast. It seems very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rotkai is the sweetheart of the long-time actress Sihan Jockbacker, a talented actress known for her recent performance in "The Number 27" and several television series.
