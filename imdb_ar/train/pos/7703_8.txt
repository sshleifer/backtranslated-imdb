I was surprised how the film could be cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Flying Frisbee dish was in effect for understanding, especially when landing, but the special effects when attacking Krill were fantastic for a film that had been produced more than half a century ago! When I lived in the Middle East, I saw the shadows of Islam creep when I suggested c. C. Adams to wear a more modest clothes Alta, and as an engineer, impressed by the imagination used in the "future" tools, tools dreamed of props management. All in all, an amusing hour and a half, the first time I see Walter Pidgeon and the opportunity to see Leslie Nielsen as a "young man"
