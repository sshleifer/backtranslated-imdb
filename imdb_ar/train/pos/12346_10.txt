This is a wonderful and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Great music score. I was twice in Japan last year, and the film gave me this usual Japanese feeling. The camera movement is superb as well as actors. Go deeply into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and nice and everything is very good on the screen here. The director plays the colors in great colors and explains to the audience that it is also possible to allow them to enjoy a film that contains accurate and exquisite details. Once you watch this movie, you'll want to see more of the same director. It's a real movie I feel good and I can only recommend it to everyone.
