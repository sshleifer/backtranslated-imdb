Not a bad word to say about this film really. I did not like it at first, but it quickly grew to me. I like it a lot and I think it's a shame that many people can not see in the past that it was banned in some areas, being one of them. The film is delivered in the Shock, Turbulence and Atmosphere section. The result is a nice piece of suspense rendering device. It seems fair that Chris Young is one of the best composers in this field. The representation in this film is of fairly high standard, if a bit of wood in some places, its effects are real and very courageous. All this is a great praise for a good slasher film in my book. I have noticed in some reviews that the film got a serious wound after being shot by the famous killer. I ask: What's wrong with that ??? It is a classic shot that excites a fan of such a good admirer and is wonderful to keep the murderer's identity secret. The only thing that prevents this film from getting the highest score in my book is that the evolution of the surprise (Detecting the Killer) is not treated with greater care, meaning it happens very quickly, although great performances make it credible. Apart from that, the pranks is a wonderful movie (although I prefer the original title), and it is a shame that many people knocking it as just a piece of waste. More than that, but few of them only know that it seems to have been lost in the fog of the early 1980s. What a shame .... it's a really good movie for people! Believe me!
