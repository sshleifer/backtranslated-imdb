The actors are gorgeous, the scenery is beautiful, the fact is stark. I will not explain all the comments of other reviewers because you get the picture! However, the film is not very sensitive. The reality is the slaughter of pigs and other cattle in order to survive. I also have a home book by Eleanor Randall Stewart. I read it several years ago, and I have to re-read it, because I just watched a newly released DVD that has been renumbered. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years and finally purchased it from a video store that stopped working. But Yippee! DVD now for sale, I purchased on amazon.com. Not cheap, but well worth it to me. This is a movie I will see until the end of my days!
