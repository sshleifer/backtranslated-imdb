"Foxes" are a serious look at the consequences of growth very quickly in the eighties. Unlike the sex movies that have been overshadowed by the teenage girls (Burke, Fast Times in Ridgent Hay), the film has stuck well over time. <br /> <br /> His theme of adolescent anger is as important today as it was 25 years ago and Judy Foster and sk8er boi Scott Bayou (remember him?) lead a remarkable team of young people worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film follows four Southern California girls as they move through sex and drugs without roots free of parents. Teenagers spend their days indoors and out of school and on nights at parties, concerts or on the street. They rarely go home because instant gratification is the pill, the party or the boy. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning him, the film is sympathetic, blaming adults, who do not want to force teenagers to grow alone. It is impossible for the charismatic representatives to hate. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film ?? A long and loving pan - sets the tone for the following. We see girls sleeping at dawn amid the things that define teenage girls, from Twinkies to a picture of young John Travolta, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" is recorded below. <br /> <br /> From there, the film picks up speed as the girls go to school and to life. Annie (Rocky Fugitive Cherie Currie) is a wild child who lives in the next concert or pill. Deirdre (Candice Stroeh) is a crazy drama queen boy. Madge (Marilyn Stroeh) is the shy girl above her head. It is Foster who has the plan. It is her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while keeping her absolute and desperate mother caught in the queue (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It is an almost impossible task and Foster finally failed in. <br /> <br /> Despite his age, Foxes remains a pleasure to see. The old hair, clothes, and references to the Olympic skier Dorothy Hamel did not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply stunning, with breathtaking footage from the L.A. At dawn and dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a music piece from the 1980s that includes Donna Samar and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the film is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like St. Elmo's Fire (1985) or Empire Records (1995). "Foxes" explains why they should have. But perhaps like a bowling song for "1985" Soup, they hit the wall.
