Finally, this movie appeared on a DVD in Italy (it was completely restored). I've seen this film many times and I find it these days (2003) when Italy is once again suffering from a kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the United States in this regard). I am happy because there are outcasts like Mastroiani's play in this film that he can sing again. Perhaps they can teach Sophia Lorenz in this world how to be strong and fighting for recognition as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: Most people here have already said that acting is great but the sound background is amazing. I must assume that unfortunately something has been lost if you do not understand the Italian language but I can assure you that the mechanical confrontation, the deformity of the reality in that radio history of Hitler's constant visit to Rome can really make you tremble! <br /> <br /> Masterpiece! <br /> <br />
