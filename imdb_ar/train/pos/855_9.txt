This wonderful movie is finally well written characters that you can love with all its good and bad advantages. Pierce Brosnan Hosterie in this self-role. I think it's the best thing he has ever done. He has performed other roles that have shown a degree of capacity for this kind of full work, but this role has finally given him the space to work with. I almost died when he walked through the hotel lobby in his underwear and shoes. Greg Kenner and Hob Davis are also looking forward to ambition, as well as reps looking forward to it too. Kenner is so beloved that his role in the end is truly gratifying. You give good actors a good job to play with and they give us something more.
