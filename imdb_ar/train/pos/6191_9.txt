Hal Hartley's films seem to have been a big success with most audiences. This film will not be an exception to this rule. Fime Grimm acts as an arrangement for Henri Fowl for Hartley in 1998. This time the focus is on Henry's former wife (played by perfection by the always welcome Parker Busy), who is stumbled upon by CIA guards about Henry's unpublished book on His suspicious dealings. In all this, Fei ends up on an early flight, dealing with international spies, etc. The film gets bogged down in the second half. If you are a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is something that should not be missed. For a novice from Hartley who has only heard of his style in filmmaking, you may want to check out his previous movies before watching this film (especially if you have not seen "Henry" yet). I was impressed by the work of the camera, which sometimes reminded me of shooting early Ray Man.
