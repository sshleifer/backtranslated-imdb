I saw this Kung Fu movie when I was a kid and I think it was wonderful! Now I'm 26 years old, and my friend is on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We got a drink, and we saw this classic movie has nothing from the original Kung Fu compass! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... DVD available. I think this movie is also called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Watch it soon!
