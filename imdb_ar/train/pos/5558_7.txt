This story is a familiar story in the long-standing cartoons of Tom and Jerry, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that two cats instead of one are threatened with expulsion if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Living at home with him, so this bothers the Mummy Toe Shoes that are incredible because they have a mouse though there are two cats at home. <br /> <br /> In any case, a person who holds Jerry can stay while the other gets on the boot, so the competition is running! <br /> <br /> Although it's a familiar area, I still enjoy it because the cartoons have enough original depression to make fun of. Not only were the cats competing against each but Jerry in the equation as well, so there were enough good gags to recommend for sure if you were a Tom and Jerry lover.
