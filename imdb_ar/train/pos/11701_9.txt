It's a great movie for all X'ers ​​generation. What a different world, America was compared in 1972 to our 21st century. You can get to know what it was like in 1972 passed by America by watching this movie. I found that the clothes and styles of the car brought back to me wonderful memories of a much better country than we have now. Just thinking ... At that time there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS or Muslim terrorists or Rod Rage or 911 or avian influenza or highway snipers or so on. The Vietnam War was over. There will be 7 years before the advent of Star Wars. The PC and the Internet will remain 29 years old. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared, producers had to market the film themselves, as no other film company wanted it. So I started touring small Protestant churches across the country that are being shown on film projectors (this was days before video recording). The church patron, who will be interested in presenting a "thief in the neighborhood", will receive a copy of the film. Then he had an evening to show in the church meeting area or the lunch room. Members of the group will invite friends and family members who are not "saved" and will be a social event during the week. <br /> <br /> If you can go beyond the limited production values ​​of the movie and watch it only because of its nostalgic value, I think you will enjoy the movie more. Of course I am speaking as General Zer. <br /> <br /> If I have a timeline, I'll go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century planet.
