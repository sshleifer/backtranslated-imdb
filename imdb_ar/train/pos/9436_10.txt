"It's all up to you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." The day my father left my mother, he took me to watch this movie with his new girlfriend, on the opening day at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was 14 years old. I was not quite sure what I was seeing, but I would never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Betty. <br /> <br /> Today, thirty-six years later, he still gives me shivers. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Bert Reynolds, and that's why he stood in line for about an hour to see what was supposed to be Action Film. I have seen two films in the dome before that: "Grand Prix" and "Song of Norway". Well, this was not Mario Andretti or Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at this tender age, I appreciate the artist ... After seeing again today, I was surprised that I was still standing after I saw this very hard film annoying but well designed. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a painful experience for a 14-year-old who has not yet accepted his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for taking me, but it was common for a child to see him. <br /> <br /> I'm still grown up, but I find it very disturbing, but I'm still very impressed by the quality of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds is an absolute genius, as with all principles ... from Billy Redden as the original guitar wonder, to Rooney Cox as a terrifying salesman ... everyone is doing a great job. Unmatched sound quality, from chirping birds to timed clocks. Photography and film ... All the technical aspects of this wonderful film are top notch. <br /> <br /> The moral questions raised, from the killing of sexual aggressors to the aftermath of human murder, remain as deep today as they did when this pioneering film was released. The classic sequences to try to survive in the wild after dealing with such unexpected brutality are life changing. These four men, the city men, who suddenly faced a position that was not conceivable, lifted the obstacle from work to terror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic thing to be sure. The phrase "You Have a Beautiful Mouth" has been moved indefinitely from Saturday Night Live to informal comments about the water coolant at work. This film is undoubtedly a big part of our popular community culture ... like "Make a Day" or "I'll be Back" Absolutely. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you found that your friends were sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far from your city life, a warm bed, wife and children? If you take the action taken by Bert Reynolds (and I would do the same), will you bury the body under the lake that will soon be, or will you be tried and facing your chances? The bottom line is: delivery delivers. You can take it to the bank. If this film is not under your skin, you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen this before, hire him again and ask yourself the above question. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of the film remains as follows: Ed failed to kill the deer ... then change. Life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. I suppose this is what this film is about John Voight, in particular, where Ed performs the best performance here. He is still one of the most talented actors in the history of Hollywood, from Midnight Cowboy to his very low performance like Franklin Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, where his actor raises the film to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined at its whims. Must see that he believes. I guarantee that your heart rate will rise to a new level. <br /> <br /> He walks fast, tense, taut and tightly drawn like a Panju series, a moral play that raises questions that still exist today. Time has changed, but our choices as human beings have not changed. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
