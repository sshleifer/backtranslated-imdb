I do not agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to American international pictures. Basil Derrondon directed a brutally realistic film and an honest attempt to portray the emergence of juvenile delinquency in England after the war (but without feeling "Blackboard Jungle"). Cinematography was excellent because it captured the scarcity and isolation of large residential properties. The estate looks like an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent as a hard-hitting, re-categorized informant - "URGENT, URGENT - STEALING - FIVE LEADERS" !!!! He finds he butt many jokes. David McCallum showed that he was one of Britain's best young talents in the 1950s. (He had a completely different role in another film by Stanley Baker "Hell Drivers"). His portrayal of Johnny and the student he followed was a very frightening inspiration. Ann Heewood was also very good as a cynical Cathy. I can not say that there was a romantic sub-plot in it. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman investigates a series of deliberate attacks by a "fireman". As he found evidence that could lead to a breakthrough, he was appointed in the events section - he is deeply disgusted at what he feels is not the proper police action. In the midst of all the hype he received in his first contact - the 6-year-old twin Murphy is working on a scam at local lollipops! <br /> <br /> He took the twins to the house he met with their younger brother Johnny and their lunatic sister Cathy. Begins to realize how life in appalling residential real estate can turn young children into criminals. As his engagement with the family increases, he realizes that there is a strong link between the fires, Johnny and a Chinese young man who is afraid of working for laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing, in an unusual role, far from the horrors of Hammer) explains that when Johnny was younger, he had saved some people from a burning building and welcomed him to the hero. He wanted to restore the sense of importance and his usefulness and felt that he was able to do so by lighting fires. The siege of the school was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the fear of the children - the teacher (thinking only of safety) running and closing them in the room with the gunman !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a really great film and tried to show some of the social problems that Britain faced after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
