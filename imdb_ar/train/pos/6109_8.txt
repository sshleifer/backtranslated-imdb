My Tutor Friend is a good romantic comedy movie programming that has something similar to My Sassy Girl .. No kisses / sex. Hollywood should learn more than Korean products. Sex is not always required in a good romantic film. <br /> <br /> The film features a light-hearted accent with occasional CG cartoon scenes blended into the film. I love the part when Ji-hoon kissing almost Su-Wan. The most poignant moments are when Ge Hoon made Su Wen's first love because he got Suo Wan out of another girl and would be a father soon. How Dad became revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience. Mao points: 8/10
