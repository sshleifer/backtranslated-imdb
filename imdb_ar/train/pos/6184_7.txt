Since this is Black History Month and I review the achievements of many African-Americans in the film in chronological order, I got this movie on the VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and Orchestra were in it. Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the highlight of this mysterious, mysterious comedy mix of murder. Many other numbers that I liked were Kitty Carlyle's special "Sweet Marijuana", Carlisle Price's Carlisle cocktails from Carl Bresson, as well as Deo with Carlisle in it previously, and songs by Michael Gertrude who is as wonderful as the woman you love. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen may spend a very long time with love / hate jokes as a product and investigator but they grow on you. Toby Wing Nadva is a sexy idiot like Nancy who tries to say something to Oki but gets "not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive behind the killings that occur, I was not surprised to find out who did it. And get a lot of nudity in the women here (though covering the breasts, of course with their hands or with a flimsy top). This was very clear before the symbol. Worth searching for any orange film interested in this kind of thing. As a resident of Louisiana for a long time, I would like to point out that when someone was born here where Carlyle was born in New Orleans.
