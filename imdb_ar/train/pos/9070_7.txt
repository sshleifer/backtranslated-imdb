He began to work slowly after an excellent animated introduction, where he directed a group of characters and prepared the school for their development. Once the bet is played, the movie quickly rises because it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be dealt with by 7pm. We have had a good chance on our way home to discuss some things with our son: the wits, help others, and think about the matter when you do not want to do something. <br /> <br /> Particularly noticeable is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Halle Kate Eisenberg. Director Kinda sneaks into her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen she is captivating. She is one of the faces "Hello, looks familiar", then remembered that she was the little girl Pepsi had appeared about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie", that movie about a parrot who tries to find his way home. <br /> <br /> Ms. Eisenberg appeared in many television and movies from 1999 to 2000, but then did not see much in the next few years. She is now fourteen and growing into a beautiful woman. Her smile increases the screen temperature. If you can get some good roles, you might have a good career (or better?) From Helly Joel Osment, another representative of three particular children, but hopefully without some problems Osment has recently encountered. <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 yo son, who just finished reading the story, does not seem to follow the film well, but it was fun. The end of the film seemed like a great preparation for some of the fungus (how to eat boiled egg shells?), Which may not be a bad thing. It was good to take the family into a movie and you do not have to worry about scenes of language, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the film is the respect / fear shown by the principal, Mr. Burdock (Boilerbelt). Today's films tend to show the personalities of adults as gifts. While he has one idiot scene, the school ruled with a strong hand. It was also good to see Andrea Martin get some work.
