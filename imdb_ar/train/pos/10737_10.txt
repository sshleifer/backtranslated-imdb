If I did not know anything, it looked as though it had been organized, but it was not. It was set up perfectly and how they got all these amazing shots! The unfortunate events that took place on September 11, 2001 are well gathered in this documentary and the classic footage that made it an unfortunate classic. Only the history in the footage alone should make it something that any American or person affected by the September 11 tragedy should see.
