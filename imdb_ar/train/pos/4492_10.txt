But I want to say that I do not agree more with Muira. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about it just this morning, and I wanted to give advice to some idiot who lost money on his debit card through fraud and wanted to say "Keep your money in your pocket" and realized I was talking like James Mason . <br /> <br /> Even if you do not say these words, I still think it will! I never forgot "Did you bear?" In his reconciliation with his son, Hewitt Bennett: "Always have money in your pocket!" good advice. <br /> <br /> There are not enough children with parents who have such unforgiving but good faith attitudes anymore. Or any father at all. <br /> <br /> It would be good for us to return "you", "your" and "yours" to our language to show that we care. It is just like "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. <br /> <br /> Add: I just realized that many of my observations were about James Mason in The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think the reason is that I mixed Susan George with Healy Mills. Well, easy error. <br /> <br /> I stand next to the comments until. <br /> <br /> Spring and Port Wine is very much like The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you took his girlfriend to the pictures in those days, you really had what you were saying and talking about afterwards, which affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theater experiences are almost real and they are important in helping young people grow. <br /> <br /> I think teenagers can not now go to the Pacific Islands just like we did now.
