Here, on IMDb.com, I read a view that Gray Owl is the best character played by Pierce Brosnan. I do not know if he has better or worse roles, I'm not a fan of him, but this role was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - an influential hand for the film's director. I give my respect. The serenity, beauty and spirit of wildlife have been explained very exclusively, which I have never met in any film before. <br /> <br /> There is something else left in my mind after the film - this is the film closest to the original books, and the atmosphere in them. <br /> <br /> A little more. Pay attention to the original gray owl.
