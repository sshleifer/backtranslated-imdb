ANTWONE FISHER is the story of an emotionally troubled American sailor. His problems lead to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems stem from his childhood. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to throw a tear or two. The film can melt the coldest heart. I loved the story, which turned from something very bad to a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, and most importantly about forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are child abuse, adoption and care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington is doing an impressive job in his first director's debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. It included the beginning (dreams of a little boy? Check out the huge pancakes!) And the end (dreams turned into reality), which linked the story beautifully together. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Anton to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his abandoned family. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene occurred when the young man finally confronted his mother and reacted to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All actors are well represented. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won the Oscars and his success in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Locke, showed why he was right about the Anton Fischer part. They have created a real and attractive work for the heart. <br /> <br /> Joey Bryant who played Cheryl, Anton's love interest, was like the sun on the screen. Chemistry flows well among romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Nuvella Nelson, who played Ms. Tate, a despicable character, deserves a special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played the role of Fisher's mother performed wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
