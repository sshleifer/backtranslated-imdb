Only 9/10 of me, would be the best ten if there was more plot for the film, but nevertheless Moonwalker still to this day is a fun festival for music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with the montage of videos from Jackson's long life, he reminds viewers why he is considered the "king of pop." From the song "I want you to go back" to "We are the World" award-winning charity for Africa. After this short film of some kind, despite the lack of an Oscar-winning screenplay, it offers a wonderful and entertaining drama to the audience. Ending with the perfect delivery (sexy!) For "Come Together". Something that the whole family can see and enjoy.
