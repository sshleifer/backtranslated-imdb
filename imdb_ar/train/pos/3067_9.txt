What a surprise to come over the TV late. If I only read a brief plot on a TV list before watching the movie, I would have passed. The idea of ​​a film about the vision of a successful man, a man who shrinks in his departure from leaving business and falling in love ... seems trivial. But the film works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man holds his weight on his shoulders, even before he says a word. The look and feel of the film is perfect. Dark, but not so hateful. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the legendary side that offers a touch of surrealism, Messi's character wrestles with his marriage, and his father's control. Messi shows a suppressed sadness, and his conversations with his young son are amazing. The young boy shows acting skills beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I can not believe I accidentally bumped into it on the television late at night.
