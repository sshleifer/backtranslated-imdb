Both Clare and his wife, Bonnie, and their teenage children, Kenny and Nancy, were loved and respected in their small hometown of Holcombe, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, the four were savagely murdered. Unexpectedly, the crime left an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and continued the course of the case until its end. The result was a book in cold blood. Has become controversial, shocking and well written, and has become one of the bestsellers on the international level, and continues to be a crime book to this day. <br /> <br /> The 1967 version of Capote's work is as remarkable as the book. Itself. It has been filmed in black and white in many realist locations, and is characterized by documentary quality, clarity and a little bit of detachment - and the total is exceptional. This is the film that underpins Robert Blake's reputation as an actor, and deserves it. As Killer Perry Smith, Blake catches you between a deep dislike and an unexpected sympathy shock. It's a brilliant performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is not. <br /> <br /> Like Capote, the film begins with Smith and Hickock while they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter - just to suddenly blow a crime to detail the investigation that eventually led to their arrest and conviction. The focus of the film has always been the moment when we finally see what happened in the house of chaos. He was actually filmed in the same film Clutter house, a wonderful, shocking and very disturbing sequence. <br /> <br /> The director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very strong sense of deliberation, making mistakes only in the sense that it allows the film to become a little preacher. But given the overall strength of the film, this is a nuisance. Strong Things - Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Amazon
