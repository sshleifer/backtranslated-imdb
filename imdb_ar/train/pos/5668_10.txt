I stumbled into this series and not by chance. After half a ring, I was hooked. The American Gothic was a dark and strange series with Gary Cole as a mysterious, and perhaps evil, Buck who is trying to control his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the evil Gary Cole and I was more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb could stand against Sheriff Buck, one of the most feared characters ever created for a television series. Rarely did I see a representative of a child with a presence or talent like Lucas Black. If you are not lucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, check out Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a great show with many mysteries and puzzles that were never explained in a short time.
