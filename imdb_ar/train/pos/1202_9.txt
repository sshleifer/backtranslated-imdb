I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer trying to show "The Dawn". It was a wonderful look at how outsiders try to get inside to make it great. <br /> <br /> The story was well compiled and organized in an interesting way that made the film flow well. Definitely worth seeing. My only complaint is that there seems to be no closure. Maybe that's part of the point. We expect that but in reality this is not what happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer out of their Canadian television program. You can see a bit of what has not yet come. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing the Papal Chase.
