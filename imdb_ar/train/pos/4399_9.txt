The most concise way to describe Ride With The Devil is one word: authenticity. I will not rephrase what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much this historical research and the hard attention to details that the staff experienced were undoubtedly appreciated. <br /> <br /> As a student in history familiar with the period and preparation of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fantasy movies about "Kansas Bleeding." Yes, there have been freedoms seized in actual events, as all fairy tales are appropriate to do. But the general feeling of the film is real. Authentic costumes and authentic attitudes (there are not too late on PC here) so the actors look original. Evelle Joel Keltcher (who has a small part in the film) seems to have stepped up from the mid-nineteenth century portrait. <br /> <br /> A few of the viewers I spoke to have expressed their anger at the grand dialogue. They can not believe that nineteenth century farmers "will talk like poets." <br /> <br /> What they did not realize is that in this era of verbal decadence, the American public in the 19th century was amazingly literate. An eloquent bunch. These people grew up on Shakespeare and the King James Version of the Bible. The scriptwriter reconstructed the most likely verbal patterns for these people, based on time documents. The designer dialog box adds to the magical atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works on the visceral level. He was filmed and performed beautifully, and goes back to the days of the Great Western Epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, has been filmed many times before in many other less famous films with a sense of urgency putting the viewer in the middle of the event. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and moral conflict. This film contains everything the director can want. <br /> <br /> In a year dominated by excessive litter like American Beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will get it in the coming years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
