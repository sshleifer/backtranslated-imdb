This is one of the most wonderful films I've seen in recent times. Even up on any international film of any reputation. I'm really surprised why this did not get the recognition it deserves. Sonali Kolkarni's win of the National Prize may be the only consolation fact. Renuka Daftardar simply stuns as she talks closely through her eyes. There are some highlights: When Gori returns from the city at Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notes a change in Gori, but not a single line of dialogue. A whole series of emotions is conveyed through subtle behaviors and eyes. There is something else in the end when Krishna appeals to Abhay Kolkarni to marry Gori instead. If you are not taken to this scene, you will not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for great possibilities in filmmaking and its impact.
