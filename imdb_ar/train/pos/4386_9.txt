This is one powerful movie. The first time I saw them, Scottish accents made it hard for me to understand much which led to the destruction of the viewing experience. I gave up on it, but I then got the DVD and used English subtitles when I needed it, I really got into this movie and I discovered how good it was. It is a nice. <br /> <br /> The wide picture makes it stunning in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart, a tale of good versus evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (Evil). Both perform their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors encounter scum like Ruth. Man, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant and angry snort. (It's very bad and hateful, sick critics love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man man and a strong hero character as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here at the top of the female. The film guides you and shares with you perfectly, so it's perfectly ready to enjoy an emotional experience when you watch it.
