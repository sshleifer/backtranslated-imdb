Anyone who has seen or not seen our judicial system will find this film truly satisfactory. There was not much shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. Almost every character in this film embodies what is best and worst in our society. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that most of us have had to deal with ticks at one time or another alongside Nambi-Bambi, the lily bureaucrats, the troublemakers who tend to be called "health politicians". <br /> <br /> Offers in all areas were compelling. I sympathized with the victim of rape - at the same time, I found it gratifying to see her wipe out the arrogant arrogance of evil from the faces of her former attackers. In particular, the dam found one of the worst characters in all the movies I saw, so it was good to see her former victim shut her mouth forever. The main rapist and psychologist were equally ugly, so it was fitting that Harry himself would attack him in an amazing way in the end. This was the only sequel to the dirty Harry epic that tied the first one.
