I remember seeing it at the Salem Film Theater (where I used to attend "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a little boy and never forgot. I and my friends surprised me. I wish there was a way I could see it again! I've tried to find a bunch of shorts or something like that to no avail. I recently discovered that the movie Cousteau has blew my mind over. How heck accomplished this is beyond my understanding. The fish already exist in your cat's mouth at one point, if you remember correctly! If anyone can help me find a way to see it again, I would be very grateful!
