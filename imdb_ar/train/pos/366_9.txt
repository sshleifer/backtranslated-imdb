This movie is very cool, hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not identify which is better, the book or the film. <br /> <br /> Wobe Goldberg is wonderful, and Oprah Winfrey, this good actress, can be funny, happy and miserable all at once. The film was well directed by Steven Spielberg, and should not end. 9/10
