The only thing in this movie that bothers me is that the DVD is expensive. That's a lot for my budget right now, or I'll buy it, because the film is a good example of noir ... and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jan Peters and Tilma Ritter. <br /> <br /> The standard produces great DVDs, but sometimes the asking price is a bit lower. This is the case here in an 80-minute black-and-white monochrome film, which is good, but nothing unusual, cinematic. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here (unlike pictures, actors, voice, groups, etc.) in the form of a twitch (Widmark) unintentionally ends up using a spy microfilm in his possession after stealing the Peters purse. (Say it three times!). Everyone except Peters is a believable figure in this film: Widmark, Cops, American Agents and Communists, especially Ritter as "Moe", Detective. She and Widmark are the two stars of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy game but loses its credibility early by "falling in love" with Widmark at the first meeting even though it is bad for her. Only in the world of cinema !! Very bad, because this romantic part of the story keeps away from him. <br /> <br /> This average Noir film means well, but it's not good and definitely not worth having a price of between $ 25 and $ 35. For this price, one can do much better in Noir film market.
