War Company is a funny but strange film. The actors are loved, and the film is loved, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll go to the plot later. This is a movie with some strange casting options. Along with John Kusak as a hit man, who we saw years ago in the empty Grosse Point, I was impressed. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing the role of a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her personality is strange. There is a scene where the scorpion stuck down her pants. He hits Hauser (Kozak). There is a twist in the end that includes the two letters. That's logical. <br /> <br /> This is the only choice I choose. It just caused a strange plain. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny and never bored. Here we have some of the best actors there. Except for Miss Duff. It's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tome, Joan Kozak, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hit man named Hauser (Cusack). Was sent to some cities in the Middle East to put a blow on an oil man named Omar Sharif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his personal problems, he has to help with the wedding of pop star (played by Hilary Duff). He falls in love with a reporter (played by Marissa Tommy). There's nothing about popstar though. Hauser feels disgusted by her. There is a scene where a song sings, and then throws it. <br /> <br /> The twist at the end of the movie reveals some kind of reason. The thing in this evolution is that I did so kind of see it coming. But that does not matter. This is a funny, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most actors. Really, how can I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
