This anime seriously shook my socks. When the anime opened itself for the first time, I felt it was too slow; the story was not moving forward, and Chero was an impressive leader. Once you learn more about tracing, you can learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story disappears and you can see multiple aspects of them moving together. It was wonderful. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the characters evolved was very real to be shaped by the way real people develop, in the real world. There were no obvious stupid things. The evolution of Elijah and Rene was interesting to watch, but I think the way Chiro and Saber grew up in their particular characters was interesting to see. Some of the "surprised" people who appear (Gilgamesh?) Seem to be also different from the rest of the actors in one way or another, meaning that "Generic Bad-ass A" has not been replaced by "Generic Bad Ass B" once A. /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the music.Record the opening music, the final theme of the last episode only ... seriously push forward the last episode topic more.Good post, type MOON!
