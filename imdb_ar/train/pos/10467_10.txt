But unfortunately because of rights issues, it is almost certain that this will never happen. Copies of Joe Bob's commentary are available on sub-films B that are shown on the Internet, but they do not fully capture his twang-twinkled connection, which was a real shout. At present, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is limited to the complementary features of classics such as "I Spit On Your Grave" (featuring what some exploiters call the greatest mass rape of the film of all time), and Jason X, Last Friday was the 13th of all time (the series were never the same when I left Paramount). All that I was thinking about when they canceled it was: "Damn, where will I get shreds of meat, dirty jokes and trivialities every Saturday night? Does this mean I have to get a life now?" Unfortunately, it is. But there will always be a place in my heart the hungry horror of "Monstervision". Long live the leadership!
