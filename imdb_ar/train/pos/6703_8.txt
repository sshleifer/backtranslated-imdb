My kids recently started watching this show restart - both early episodes on N, and subsequent episodes on ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not realize that the program lasted until the first or second season), I'm curious to see what prompted all the changes made - I have seen them described as "highly publicized", and after half an hour of research the efforts posted on the web only revealed comments Endless about how early episodes were much better than subsequent episodes. (Personally, I do not see much difference - scripts and themes stay pretty much the same all the time - but they lose some great people along the way) My daughter put DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the earth has special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this. I also wish they had some self-reference humor about the changes - like "Boy Meets World" where they give up the little sister for a full season or so, and when another actor plays later, they ask her where she says "upstairs" or when "Minkus" in an early series of "Minkus" to graduate from high school, asking him about his whereabouts and saying "there," referring to the part of the classroom that never appeared in the camera, before he said, "Mr Turner, wait!" (Mr. Turner is another character I left) Oh well - maybe there will be a real Hollywood story about this or something? I was very happy to see Aunt Hilda appearing at the end - she has always been one of my favorites - it's so bad that it could not be a more comprehensive meeting. (Zelda candle did not cut off for me)
