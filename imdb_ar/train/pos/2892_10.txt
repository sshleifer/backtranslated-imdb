Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie since about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains the story of short stories, entertainment songs and the whole secondary character please. The wicked in the form of step sisters are evil and fully enslaved. Then there's the most magic of all Disney, the mice make the dress and you know the rest well. To sum up four of the Disney Princess movies are all fantastic but this is a charming magical experience to watch and enjoy. Oh of course, Cinderella is as wonderful as the main character in the film. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elaine Wood and others the film feels like this, you can not simply smile but smile. <br /> <br /> They say that the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course in the real world, there are some believers and others are believers. In this film becomes more magic when you smile rainbow. <br /> <br /> Of course the rest is ... Cinderella
