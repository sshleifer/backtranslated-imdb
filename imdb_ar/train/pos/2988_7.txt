The original version is preserved with Barbara Stanwyk only through Stanwyk's performance. The story and other performances are extremely sweet and deadly and the movie itself is so dated that it can not be enjoyed today. The Bette Midler version is more interesting. She is Stella Clare, an independent single woman with a free spirit who gets sick and refuses to help her friend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in poor performance). She raised her daughter Jenny, who was quietly played by Terrini Alvarado, and then came to the conclusion that Jenny's father could do what was best for her and eventually make a life-changing decision. During the film, there is a lot of laughter, tears and memorable moments between Medler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason participated as the father's father in Jenny, showing that the wealthy had a very good effect on her. If you like Midler or Goodman or just good movies with lots of passion, you'll enjoy the BELL MIDLER version of STELLA.
