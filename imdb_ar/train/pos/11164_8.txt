In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brody and the rival volunteer firefighters has led to the famous Prodi bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people through the spoof of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" of 1949. <br /> <br /> This very interesting movie is likely to be widely available if the bad scene is not available Reprehensible reputation that includes some Chinese residents - a time capsule of racist anti-century attitudes, giving the film a great deal of historical interest, in my view.
