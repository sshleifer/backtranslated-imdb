Clint Eastwood returns to the role of Dirty Harry Calahan in the fourth film of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older but still gets it. He has asked Harry to take leave after some problems have been caused by theft (where the phrase "make an unforgettable day" comes from a place!) A woman turned to wakefulness after being attacked by a rapper in a tavern and started to get The bad guys one by one. The last movie to watch Sandra Lock in Clint Eastwood! After the Enforcer improved it was a bit more comedy and less dangerous. The sunglasses from Clint Eastwood were Gargoyles, famous for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth watching if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or thriller movies and erotic crimes.
