Telling the story of Fox to one of America's greatest pioneering efforts, comes to DVD with some truly outstanding "additions". The story of the great leader, who drew inspiration from the faith of the Mormon (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after the mob killed their prophet / leader, was brought Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a bold move on Fox's president, Darrell Zanook, and it was a wonderful soul for the Mormons, as this was the first film attempt to show their faith on the screen positively. Now Fox, in collaboration with James D'Arc, coordinator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this film to DVD format in a stunning release. Mr. D'Arc, who several years ago submitted his doctoral thesis in the film, presented one of the deepest commentary tracks ever made for a DVD disc. It separates truth from fiction and allows listeners to understand why church leaders appreciate these films, even though the motifs of the truth are spread throughout the film. One interesting feature of the film is Dean Jagger, the starring actor. After many years of the film he married a last saintly woman and was eventually converted to LDS faith. There's a lot to learn from D'Arc and it's great to be part of a DVD! There are more than 100 Fox & BYU archives on the disc, as well as news clips of the stunning premiere of seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks for the FOX on another wonderful DVD - thank you, James D'Arc for your awesome comment!
