You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> An earlier review by pninson of Seattle has identified all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only amplify its basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel that is much darker than his previous work. This is taken very literally by the director, Ross Devinish, who accumulates on the gloom and fog too much. When Ada, Rick, and Esther appear, half an hour after the opening of the episode, it is convenient to be in daylight for the first time. In some mysterious scenes, it was hard to see what was on my TV. I saw everything in one day, starting in the middle of the afternoon. Because the daylight is gone, this is less of a problem, but I have a good TV and I have never had this problem at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The speed of the rhythm is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure this was intense, but overpriced. There are many shots of people traveling in spite of the mud and depression in Victorian London that stay longer than necessary for mood and atmosphere. It is possible that a good editor will take several minutes of each fifty-minute episode, without losing the dialogue line, just by cutting each of these scenes a bit. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two problems. Will soon adapt to the shape and speed of this production. The most important issue is that it does not tell the story always very effectively. Earlier, Dickens' novels were as long as Bleak House, but were not nearly planned. For example, I recently reread Nicholas Nichliebe because I was fascinated to see how Douglas McGrath took an 800-page book in his two-hour film. The answer is simple: the book is full of stuff. McGrath cut off large areas of the novel while retaining all the elements of the story. This will not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production takes seven hours. Perhaps, you need a longer period, because many elements of its complex scheme are not clear enough, or handled well, as it should be. Some random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The maid, Rosa, appears from anywhere without a background, so Ms. Diddluk's association with her is largely irresistible. <br /> <br /> Accepting Sgt. George's request to Tolkienhorn for a sample of Horton's handwriting is somewhat deceiving. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is actually with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Garndees. Nor is it clear that they agreed not to announce their engagement, or why. <br /> <br /> The marriage of Ada and Rick the Secret has been deleted. In one episode, they are just lovers, and in the next stage, people suddenly refer to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Ms. Rouncewell was only presented late in the story and Sergeant George was questioned about his family. It is not interpreted - as it is the way in which it was discovered. <br /> <br /> Tolkienhorn's dedication to preserving the honor and respect of the Didlock family is minimized, so his motivation to persecute Ms. Dudlock is far more obscure than it needs to be. <br /> <br /> The makers of bricks with both Tom and Lady Ledlock are somewhat ambiguous. <br /> <br /> It is not clear that Guppy is renewing his offer to Esther because the scars of the smallpox have disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a choice: there are others. It's not big problems and the main content of the story is clear enough. However, they are a simple irritation detracting from their power: you should not have to puzzle on small points. However, there are more significant structural problems that lead to the weakening of the story in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The Tulkinhorn killing is completely eliminated. Bucket immediately points to Hortens as a suspect, undermining the suspense in Sergeant George's dilemma and the importance of finding Ms. Ronswell. It also minimizes the effect of the sub-schema in which Ms. Didlock is questioned and weakens the scene in which Hortins is hidden in front of Sir Leicester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, the investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock, have dominated the story for more than an hour, and during this period we completely lose sight of the other main conspiracy plot: the legal issue and its impact on Rick. All his failed financial resources, his manipulation by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's desperation, his deteriorating health, etc. were stopped. This may be what Dickens wrote for the book (I have not read it in years), but a good scenario must keep the different threads of the plot moving forward together. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smoloid in the story diminishes. It's almost unnecessary. His discovery of the new will, unleashing the final stage of the story, is thrown away. This happens outside the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it is still very good production. Many excellent offers. Individual scenes are beautifully realized. Her sense of tragedy is very strong. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation to a great book, not for 2005 production. In fact, I might not fully understand its flaws if I did not see how Andrew Davis did it better. I've been criticizing Davis Jane Austen's modifications, but I must admit that he really knows how to tame the vast Dickens books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive drama that is admired and deserves seven hours of anyone's time. However, its likely fate is to be seen primarily as a reference to the 2005 semi-final version.
