A strange horror film full of a famous face, but stolen by Christina Raines (later from Flamengo Rod) as a beautiful but somewhat unstable model with a dark smile that is supposed to pay for suicide attempts by guarding the "Gate of Hell"! The scenes are taken with Rennes models very well, mood music is perfect, and Deborah Ravine is a witch like Pal Cristina, but when Rynes moves to a stone built Brooklyn Heights (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start to cook. The neighbors, including the ill-fated Borghes Meredith and the strange couple Silvia Miles and Beverly Dangelo, are many devils, and Ellie Walach is very fun as a cop. The film is almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a mix! Based on Jeffrey Connitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is nervous and full of shocks by director Michael Weiner, who is rising with a brilliant end to pessimism. *** 1/2 of ****
