This was, and not some opera subert Sob O'Brien, the greatest epic graduated from the greatest Hollywood of 1939. I will never repeat my career Grant, Victor McGlagen (who was Bengals Lancer), and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. make wonderful comic performances. However, I would like to refer to two other elements, less understanding this masterpiece. The magnificent final battle sequence, where Sam Jaffe is strikingly climbing to the top of the temple to blow up his horn and warn the regiment, is simply great. He never fails to impress me. Another element of the film is the performance of Eduardo Cianelli as a teacher. This is not the picture of Manchu Fu caricature, but he is a good graphic and frank and historically landmark ("Have you heard about the Moya Changroputra? Defeated the armies he left in India Alexander the Great") villain. In fact, one can see the similarities between this evil nationalist mystic and a well-known figure of the 1930s (German, not Indian). Gonga Deen, the anti-Nazi channel? not exactly. But still, epic epic, funny, moving.
