I am a member of the rowing club and I can tell you the fact that the process of salvation is in harmony with the calmness and tranquility of the experience. As we put our boats in the water, the banjo resonates in the back of the conscious mind. This film is free because it removes philosophical about the status of man in nature and the impact of technology on man's relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the tent house made. There is also disdain for the city man and a sense of superiority over the "cracking" of the rural jungle. The fact that the Banker of Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" means putting him at the same level with woodcutters who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the conflict of life and death replaces the "suppositions" of the civilized man around the "law". This boat trip ends very soon for the viewer, but unfortunately soon enough for the characters.
