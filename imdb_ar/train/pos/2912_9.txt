We have thrown the term "star" in a very light way these days, but here is someone who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> This entire presentation has been aligned. The choice of the song was perfect - it contained only the songs I wanted to hear and cut in documentaries during the weaker new songs. I loved that band was just five men on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this power, you will not need to enjoy the circus). <br /> <br /> The crowds were also amazing. How many artists can influence the Beatles' original fans (now 50 years of age and beyond), make young children jump in the opening lines "Can not Buy Love" and influence everyone? <br /> <br /> While watching, I also realized that following the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney immediately became a later idea. Not only did Paul lose John and George (regardless of their final relationship, it must be difficult to lose someone who changed the world with him), but his wife, Linda, never seemed to have received Lennon's confession of murder. I agree that the death of Lennon was terrible, but now I just realized that Paul was forgotten in the wake. I was very happy because he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> For those who complain about audio / video quality, I did not have any complaints at all; both were crystal clear on my set. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the following format appears; they will never feel good. <br /> <br /> My only regret is that I did not buy a ticket for this offer when I had the chance. Thanks to this video, I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his death and then his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because, if there is nothing else, his music will remember him first. Let's hope that this does not change another crazy, because McCartney's catalog is very good.
