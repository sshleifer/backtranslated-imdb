I'm going to make it short and nice because I do not think there's much you can do to tell someone about this show that he's never seen before except his funny and unique presentation, to me, maybe it was the funniest of all. <br /> <br /> You really have to see him to understand his humor, and I may need some episodes to get to him already, but once there's no chance of getting back to you. For example, the way you want your personal Hydes to always see his friends getting involved in some kind of trouble, the more fun it happens. <br /> <br /> I mean the classics of actors, director and director. It's just a recipe for success. One actor I think is always getting hard time is Ashton Kutcher, but I mean it's fantastic in this show, and I do not think it's possible for Kelso's character to be played by anyone else, and it takes a very smart person to play stupid. All the main characters are fantastic and will not be worth the review at a time when I did not mention the cold fox of Mila Kunis stone, and now this is a warm encounter with a ha ball and all joking along with an amazing view.
