Another entry in the category of "horror vacations" that fills the shelves of the local video store. * The spoiler * "A teenager who is hungry for a teenager who takes revenge on the children" The nice "who wronged him" will of course be familiar to those who have seen it before. And those who have seen it before will see it again; those who expect Ingmar Bergman and later become dissatisfied with their lost time should skip it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack, David Burianz, Denise Richards and Katharine Hegel as eye candy - continued the flow and enjoyed it. Oh, I like the scary mask.
