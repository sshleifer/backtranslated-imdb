I remember seeing this film when it was first released in 1982 and I loved it at the time. After about 4 years, I was privileged to see Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (Tosca), so seeing the end of this film reminds me of that wonderful night. What do you not like about this film? The music was great and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looks great. The story is very funny in some parts, and the scene is still the "food battle" of the funniest I've ever seen. The hot air balloon ride over Napa Valley was beautiful, as was the song "If We Were in Love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And hear the Santa Lucia Diu wonderful. Get real people, it was a film about the opera singer named Giorgio Fini and just encountered the role of Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy that I'm still getting the VHS tape from this movie, but I like it to be released on DVD, especially now Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nyson Dorma sung by It is still in the film today!
