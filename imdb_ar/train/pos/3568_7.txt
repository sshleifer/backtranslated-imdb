This film conveys the story of Cinderella to the early 1950s and makes Isle of Man a good, though eccentric, use as a background. "Ugly Sisters" became first-class girls glamorous in English, with Kathleen Turner as the father's wife in different costumes in a remarkable period. The story is slightly changed from the traditional version: early it is strangely combined with the plot of "King Lear", and in later stages Cinderella is more assertive than usual. Looks great and works well overall, but sometimes excels.
