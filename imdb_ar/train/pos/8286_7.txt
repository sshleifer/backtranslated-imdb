Larry Vesenden is going to crush most of the comments in this forum. Well, the worst mistake, of course, is the movie marketing and DVD targeting method. Obviously this film is not a real horror film, at least, not for people who expect anything to become satisfactory and satisfactory immediately. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a film that seems to have been narrated from the young Miles mind. Things that children do not easily understand tend to stay in their small minds and ultimately dominate their fears and a threatened world they can not understand. Kim, a mother, is obviously a psychiatrist, but she has no idea what is going on in her son's mind. This is also the story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant personality, perhaps addicted to alcohol, and seems to live in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles fears reach the point of crisis over the weekend in the country. This part of New York State, with its winter landscapes and arid trees, plays a mess in the imagination of the little boy. It does not help to face a strange figure in the city, but creates more doubts in his small mind. Eventually, Miles collapses and can do nothing, evoking the spirit of Windigo. <br /> <br /> The movie is going well and acting well. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where she is in the film. Jake Weber is perfect as he is the distant father who has the chance to get close to a son who does not understand him. Eric Bear Sullivan, as Mill, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought it was very effective as the whole movie is the special Miles that take what's going on around it. Finally, John Spredakus is considered as perfect as Otis, a man who hates the world for the way he appeared. <br /> <br /> Instead of stopping this movie, viewers in the future must deal with it with an open mind.
