We really enjoyed the Gray Owl: a simple tale with its classic Atenburo style: it is an overly romantic story, with original models, humor and pressure of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> It was filmed and beautifully told the pace of this is the real story of Archie, an Englishman who converted to an original Indian and went to live and smell in Canada. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances from everyone make this movie with an easy message display. <br /> <br /> Certainly, two of the movie's stars are the newest we have ever seen - and the message is good with its environmental drawings. It should be great to meet or read Gray Owl in the thirties of the last century, a unique character, a fitting tribute to the film.
