"I looked into the eye of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," declares one of the main characters of the award-winning television program Lost. The series can be summed up as a dramatic story about a group of survivors of a stranded plane crash on an unknown island, but this would lead to spoiling the show. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who are at odds with each other, and eventually struggle with their new way of life and embrace each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island, either - and it may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new island stories that could tell us after a certain period, but it proved to be unfounded. The narration flows naturally, the dialogue witty, the characters memorable and the execution wonderful. Al Jazeera is a personal figure. To understand this comment, you have to see the series yourself, which only shows its originality and grandeur. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons were broadcast, filled with powerful episodes. My only moderate criticism is that the second season seems to be slowing down a bit midway, but fortunately it's back again in an impressive form for the last episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend one TV series, you should follow the right steps now, it will definitely be one. If you love excitement, adventure, personal stories, a very strong crew, beautiful locations, and an island that looks more spiritual than natural, the "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
