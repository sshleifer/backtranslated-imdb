Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of television, it was a foregone conclusion that I was going to the cinema and spending $ 15 on it. I also think this applies to fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the leaking of a CIA agent plotting to assassinate the president. With the start of the investigation, the only likely candidate seems to be the highly decorated (Michael Douglas) Pitt. Defending his innocence, Pitt works on the fun and elegance of the fugitive, to search for the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but definitely not spectacular. A decent crew, decent story but left me feeling something empty, but surely you can do much worse.
