I love this movie "Spring and Wine Harbor". I was born in Lee, a town about 7 miles from Bolton, and moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. Every day I worked through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle, but sometimes in the car when I could afford it. The film recreates all the memories of working class neighbors who always break, but who will always help you if possible. Fred Deppna was just around the corner from Promwich Street. If you do not see the movie when it's first released, you may be forgiven for comparing it with soap like Coronation St, OK, I agree it's soap, but then it's called "Kitchen Sink Drama!" Watch this movie for talented actors who soon became family names from recurring roles on TV, mainly watching footage of the place and feeling good that people are poor but happy!
