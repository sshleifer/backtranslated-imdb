I thought the film could be a bit more complicated, perhaps psychologically, but acting and acting were the highest. The CG animation was heavy in many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which include romances, antagonisms and win-win acquaintances. 007 fans will like this, as well as female, theme song wonderful! Wayne was filmed very well in this film, Penquin returned to its true form, there are no mutant genes in it this time! I loved the fact that Robin did not use much, Tim Drake was just a cute computer student, somewhat of an Indigo child or a future mind. <br /> <br /> The support team of some soap opera has been drawing stars, dignified talents and characters to look like sound actors too. Kelly Reba was a joy in this film. <br /> <br /> This is below Phantasm and Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked the most intelligent script than I enjoyed Subzero. 10/07
