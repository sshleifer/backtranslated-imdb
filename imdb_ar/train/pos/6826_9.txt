John Cassavet's "Opening Night" is fantastic and wonderful. They are fantastic because they play with the deepest fears that we have within our imagination, fantastic because they never stop our surprise. With its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, no one who appreciates the characters can turn a blind eye to the screen. The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon, is trying to put herself together in a game that is fighting her demons; "Opening Night" is not only about a woman about to collapse but also about the complexities of actors' . All of Cassavetes' characters here are experienced people who know about the theater world; half of the film happens on stage, either where the performers perform their function or in the backstage, where the producers, writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> The Cassavetes are extremely cruel with his characters to the extent that this inconvenience turns towards the public, but the audience in the cinema. Because there is another audience, in the movie theater, do not know what is happening and really laugh because they think that everything is performance. That's basically what it is; it's just not seeing the audience in the theater "behind the scenes" the way we do it. They do not suffer from the abundance of Gina Rolands before she goes to that stage, but more importantly she is not worried. They do not know why they behave the way they do. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with a representative. Myrtle (Roland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do; I imagine that if I have a friend who was a professional performer, it's really hard to tell when he's telling the truth because I knew he was a representative and could fake anything at any time. Many of the things that are performed by Myrtle during the terrible experiences presented by the film? We doubt it is real. The remaining characters are also questionable. <br /> <br /> A writer, Sarah (Joan Blondell), can not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote. There is a director, Manny (Ben Butcher), who can not accept the fact that his best actress may be losing; product David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where the star and star of Myrtle partner Morris (Kasavets himself) stand, Some. <br /> <br /> When you witness the death of a teenager, a fan; all this meets and affects Myrtle, but no one knows whether her illusions are real. They do not say anything because they do not want to bother her, but the film enters into a state of consciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes, we can say that everyone has it. During these moments, the wonderful text of Kaspavit portrays a brutal and frightening truth in the words that characters say in a behind-the-scenes debate; not only what Myrtle says but also what you say to them. <br /> <br /> These people who are not afraid to talk about their opinions and change what they think constantly, just like Cassavit's way of making movies. In this aspect, the performances are more important here than the "shadows", because the characters share a larger picture; a larger story that starts from trivial. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, the actual way of making movies, this film is no different from "shadows". There is something beautiful in the way the Ruban camera releases characters. When someone talks, the camera does not focus on it, it fires at the person who listens; so we can see how he or she interacts with things the other says. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, and sometimes destructive. <br /> <br /> Improvisation may still exist, despite all these wonderful performances. Near the end, there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking nonstop. Whether it is imprecise or not, we should not ask. We just have to watch. Watching each other share life experiences and see words really come alive in a conversation that means a lot more than it does, it does not become more natural.
