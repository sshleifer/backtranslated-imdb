I saw this movie, I first saw it when I was 7 years old, and I can remember the end. So I watched that 10 minutes ago (and I looked like a 12-year-old boy) I started to cry in the end, I forgot how sad he was. I think I was basically sad about Anne Marie because she said "I love you Charlie" and also "I'll miss you Charlie", he made me cry really. It must be one of my favorite films of all time, it's just a movie worth seeing. Watching ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br />, but I like this movie, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
