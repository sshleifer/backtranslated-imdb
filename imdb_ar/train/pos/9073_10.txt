My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to watch this film, and we were quite happy with the tremendous fun of the film. It has added appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film, especially the refrain from Halle Kate Eisenberg, "Boys are very strange." It is refreshing to see a film that shows unusually that boys and girls are already different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys actually do these kinds of strange things and usually survive telling the story and frightening their mothers silly! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and 11-year-old friend, myself and my 23-year-old friend, went to watch the movie the next day to spend a day of youth. We had more fun the second time and everyone raved about it. It's clean and has a lot of fun with former teen actors reminiscent of TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel it will become a sleeper blow no different from "Freaks & Geeks" that did not survive its first season but sold its DVD version. Do not see it especially if you have children and you will find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love her because of the opportunity she has to say: "Boys are very strange!" Do not miss it ...
