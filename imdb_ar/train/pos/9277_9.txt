"Cinema dead, long live the cinema!" Peter Grinaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, said at last year's Romanian film festival Anonimul, which reached the third edition and takes place in the Danube delta. This year the award went to Jaafar Panahi "sneak". I got his vision this evening in Bucharest at a retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead but still very lively. Panahi tells in a convincing way what Iranian society looks like. The film "Offside" was digitally filmed, a film inspired by a real event for Panahi's daughter: the problem and risk when she decided to attend a football match. This is forbidden in Iran as we know. What Banahi has been able to do is to offer few means, but with much work, intelligence and humor for cultural patterns in a society that puts women at a distinct level. The absurdity of the laws becomes comic. The film has a happy ending, after all because the Iranian team goes to the World Cup. What I most appreciate is the concept, the idea behind this film. I will be very interested in watching Panahi's other banned films in Iran as well. I think he can be thought of as an active director.
