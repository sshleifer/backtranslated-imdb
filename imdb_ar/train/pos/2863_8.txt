Although this show has stopped working since 1973, after watching the collection of DVDs I borrowed in our library, I felt I had to say a little about it. <br /> <br /> I can remember when it was the only color display on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there is a small evening "night party" with friends to watch on NBC on one of the few color televisions. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy history, not so many names and dates but how it affects us today and how much can be so profound on the basis of the most important actions of the time. Example: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of silver, got its name from a character called "Old Virginny", which stumbled in the early days of the city from a salon, fell and broke a bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny did not want to waste the occasion, as the precious liquid infiltrated the dirt, decided to call the town "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, was enjoying the reputation of trying to jump on everyone's claim and became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I have just watched an early episode dealing with these subjects. 2. Other episodes dealt with the rise of Mark Twain as a reporter for Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> Family entertainment was useful (often What is educational). As someone else observed, each episode will truly be considered a film in its rich texts and characters. <br /> <br /> The only thing the truth turned into was near the city of Virginia and Ponderosa. In fact, to ride from Bonderosa (all north of Lake Tahoe), one has to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1000 meters) down the top of the Spooner to the high desert (3000-4000 feet) from Carson Valley and then another 30-40 miles To the city of Virginia. It goes without saying that Cartwright will have some painful back endings doing so on a regular basis. But every writer must have the right truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this show, even today.
