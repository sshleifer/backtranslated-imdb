A film about the cruelty of this world. I found it free, as the only truth could be. It also contains some very funny bits. Some representation is unusual, see Maria Hofstätter for example. The director tried to portray life as realistically as possible, successfully. Consistent, explicit sex scenes are not fakes over the scenes of the film Nucleus. Although I barely understood the sentence, I only found seeing the film in the original language with more meaningful translations, because with half dubbing, the work of the great actors is lost. It is difficult to repeat the character played by Maria Hofstätter by Ghazal. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
