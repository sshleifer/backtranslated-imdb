Write the word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not right! Madhur Bhandarkar's courageous and brilliant "Page 3" is to destroy the legend associated with the colors and luster of our newspapers that follow her life (read party customs) with such a frantic zeal that can only explain our voyeuristic plan. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is as unfortunate as it is ambiguous. How exactly has this control gained over the printed word and when the infringement of the first page has become the subject of another debate. Bhandarkar avoids this intelligently. He is only interested in the mechanisms of this hideous presence. Thus, it combines the different elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (though I do not compare Hindarkar to the genius of Altman), Bhandarkar uses innumerable personalities to further his motives. Whether it is a 3 page wannabe NRI, gate guards, neo-rich, next model, social politician, or novelist. All characters are presented with a goal and each has a separate fee for the characters, even if their parts are too small. And here puts the gravity of the film. <br /> <br /> Kunkuna Sen Sharma plays the role of Madhavi Sharma, the talented young journalist who covers page 3 of Nation Today. At first she was satisfied with her job, she soon began to see the ugliness of this shortage covered by fake and cosmetic waste. But Bhandarcar resists the temptation to turn the subject into a film of moral oversight and avoids focusing on only one character. The film is not only about Madhavavi, but equally about Deepak Suri (Iran's Bowman) - Madhavi's editor, who accepts his role negatively as a derivative of a larger mechanism, Anjali Thabar (Sonny Razdan) - social suffocating from social pollution, Abhijeet ( Rihan Eng.) - Make-up artist and gay classmates Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - Air hostess and ruthless (Tara Sharma) - the ambitious actress. It seems impossible to accommodate many characters (and more) in one story, but full credit in the appreciation of Nina Arora and Manoj Tiagi for a narrow screenplay film. Sanjeev Datta and Bandarkar's dialogues were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, regardless of its validity, can be dropped with no real offers. Fortunately, "Page 3" embodies the actors, not the stars. Concona is easily supported by the author. As Bauman had already said. Sandhya Mridul gets the best part written, but almost too much. Atoll Kolkarni is lost despite having a written character. Sometimes, the manager seems very careful to incorporate as much as possible (sexual abuse of children, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them seem hasty. <br /> <br /> In the end, an attempt at Pandarkar is satisfying our insight, but takes it a step further. Takes us into the images and presents us with the hideous realities of this human community that seems to live in a different and distant world. These are the same people who indulged in the New Year celebrations while they were a few hundred kilometers away from their fellow countrymen who were devastated by the ferocity of nature! Smart writing, skillful songs, powerful performances and a true sense of honesty make this film worthwhile, despite its lack of quality and poor production values. "Page 3" is the best way to enter a new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
