What can one say about a film that contains one of the most aggressive blackness, the most aggressive, and sometimes the strangest - I do not say "sympathetic" .. I will say the "charismatic" villains in the history of cinema, the best sword fight ever since Cork and Fairbanks at its peak? This epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, and incredibly courageous and sincere man struggling for his honor and freedom against tyranny. loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great bad guys. Jessica Lang was very moving and sensitive.
