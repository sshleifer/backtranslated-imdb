My choice for the biggest movie used to be "Night Hunter" for laughter which is still wonderful in my canons. However, it may have been replaced by "Shower", the most artistic daisy film I've ever seen. The way in which others are nurtured is the flow of water, the way water can be inspired, comforted, cleansed, etc., is the essence of Dow. It is possible to say that the two themes of NOFTH and Shower are similar, and that Lillian Gish in the past represents the purest form of Christianity because the bath operators represent the purest forms of the Dow. I do not argue in any way against such an explanation. Both films are visual joys in their integration of idea and image. However, the shower offers such an unflattering view of the sanctity of daily life that I gave it a nod. I am the holiest of them both.
