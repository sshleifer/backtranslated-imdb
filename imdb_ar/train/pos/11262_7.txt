Devil's play is my second attempt to produce Joseph Sarno - and although I would say it is much more fun than Swedish boring and non-dramatic, it is still a bit slow and unclear to my taste. <br /> <br /> This group is centered around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle and wish to revive their former "leader". In order to do this, the girls have to dance naked, accept each other and cheer up strange things - and of course drink some blood as well. When a car crashes and her brother's car has to stop at the castle for accommodation - they provide the ideal blood bank for horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... Devil's play is a very good example of corruption exploiting 70 in early time. Lots of nudity - including some full tones, some dizzying tones - including incest, of course, vampire ... but these scenes still promote today's standards. Some women may benefit the lanes in this sex of some of the most obvious sex, but I think you can not get everything. It was also possible to benefit from some acts of violence / heaviness, because it is a vampire film, but I think the purpose of devil's play was more to show skin, not blood. It is still fairly slow - and the representation is mostly entirely wooden - but this is something to be expected from this era and from this budget. Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a bit boring because of their satisfaction. 10/07
