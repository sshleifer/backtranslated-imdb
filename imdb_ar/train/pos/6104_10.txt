I must admit, from the EROS MOVIE group, that this is the most loved thing I love too. The story is something that makes you really see it. Many EROS films contain a plot that looks like a hammer made before production. Everything is about sex, and they can get to know the number of different people coming at the end of the film. Dear God, you do not see any of these films when someone pulls a weapon. It's not nearly laughable, but you do not want to waste the energy to do it. The protagonist, the leading character (Kira Reed is a wonderful talented and beautiful). Control is the control a person has over his senses, body and feelings. One man changes everything for her, and makes her a different woman. But the mirror is broken at the same time. This makes for a wonderful film I wish I had reached first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
