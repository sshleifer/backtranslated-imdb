This is an old fashioned adventurer. I understand that by political standards today, Indian treatment was unacceptable. But this move is not about politics. It is about movement, dialogue, companionship, representation, direction, music and photography, and it is wonderful in all these factors. The Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are both electrified and gorgeous. This is the film's ultimate friend.
