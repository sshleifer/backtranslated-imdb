This is one of those films that made me feel strongly about the need for filmmaking at all. In general, I'm a fan of films based on real stories that deserve it. This is a great one! Along with the performance of Meryl, who has gained much appreciation and praise, the greatest thing in the film is the story on which it is based. The story of the couple who suffered from social and legal torture after suffering tremendous emotional pain in the death of their unexpected and brutal infant is in fact an open story revealing the inhumane side of fellow human beings, and barbarism is a very sophisticated and legal society. It is interesting to see how people who regard themselves as good and intelligent (for example, the emotional judges of the film) are in fact more than selfish fools who, because of their dogmatic beliefs and biases, would close their brains to any circulation. And even meditation in light of all the facts that clearly indicate their views. The other side of the so-called "civilized" society that the film reveals is indifference to the pain of our fellow human beings (needless to say, this is a very general matter, although this specific story unfolds in Australia) and the real cruelty. You should find out if you are willing to take something serious and possibly thought provoking.
