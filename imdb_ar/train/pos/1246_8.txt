The introduction may seem opaque, but since Murphy's personality does not take it seriously, it helps to ease the audience in this combination of mysticism and the kidnapping of boiled children in modern times. An excellent team, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy in the eighties of his age in comedy / motion. There are also some great F / X, very surreal dream sequence, the original plot somewhat. Murphy's gods are often overlooked, but this is worth considering.
