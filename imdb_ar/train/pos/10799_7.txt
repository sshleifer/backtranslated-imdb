Ah, 1970. At the time he was to be a slingshot. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a sucker but he felt bolder at the time. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a good-quality, good-core film. In fact, as is the case today, some representatives are well-known actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films developed a conspiracy and personality. <br /> <br /> It's what you expect a lot from a slingshot film. Two of the open-relationship couples are rekindling sedition from the MILF for a woman who came to visit. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Wales, it is a different story. Not many things that do not exceed forty years of age look as delicious as Mrs. Wells. It is worth it to see Mrs. Wells looking at herself in the mirror like Aphrodite. It's not "Mom Stifler". It's a more attractive way. <br /> <br /> Anna also dug Chris Jordan. Jordan looks very much like Elaine Joyce so much that I thought she might be "separate at birth" or even Ellen herself. Anna always feeds but must contain an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike the pornographic 1990s, the 1970s preserved the reality of the hard film (something the Kernel brought back in 2000 to work on occasions, instead of the 1990s music and canned jerks) and is here in full force. It is not real but real. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoyed the production of Quebec's "Deux Femmes En Or", you will enjoy it. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 you can spend per month.
