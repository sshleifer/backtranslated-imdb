What the sixties really do (for those of us raised in America's belly at those times) is the turmoil and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated figures and the notepad, the authenticity of the issues remains clear. <br /> <br /> These root times were not only change, but also very confusing. There are two main things other than our world: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new liberals began to make social changes that quickly became institutionalized. <br /> <br /> From chaos, sensitivity came, and chaos came from values. However, keep in mind that the majority of Americans did not participate in this ... They worked, played and watched the news ... and slowly became affected by the efforts and struggles of minorities ... civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, war on poverty ... . <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of journalism and television in particular has been reflected, although at best the conflict has been ignored by the public and by those who seek to change things ... At worst, their information has been distorted. Middle-class Americans were not all standing angry, carrying baseball batons, or ignoring their daughters Stray. They were very confused. Let's not forget how popular singers suddenly became protesting singers, and how the Beatles began to launch an attack that killed the popular protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of her. <br /> <br /> I think if you do not live this decade, you may not have a sense of what the film is about. In general, the picture is a bit bleak. At one point, I did a steady job while my sister lived on a pig farm and went to Woodstock. At another stage, I was in Asbury Hight and in the Detroit riots while working and played housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles were constantly changing. <br /> <br /> The film depicts three brothers from a middle-class family. They represent the Hippy child, political activist and military personnel. My father represents the usual positions, and my mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes compromise ... for peace. <br /> <br /> The black family includes a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I assume that the producers knew all the variables and had to settle the restrictions, otherwise the documentary became a long and boring document. My father's message was that anger produced bitterness, and bitterness produced chaos. It was clearly a message to young people today. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, and also how we divide problems ... The sixties of the last century were unusual in this way, and there was only a roar of 20s compared. In other words, this film has an ethical character. In the end, our collective individualism is what remains. Put it in your Aximoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a god, a guru, or a free genius in the 1960s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will close the sixties on the right ... it was very diverse (this film is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of it, that we have learned and grown from it, that once, form a generation and change America ... for the better.
