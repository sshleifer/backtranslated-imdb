I'm Italian, and when I last looked at this film I was impressed with its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate that with the mind and feelings of adults. Now I can understand that she was the masterpiece of a special season for Italian cinema (Pasolini etc), by that time he went. <br /> <br /> The epic Hollywood movies are good ... for fun. Perhaps this version of "Odyssey" has no English version because it is not funny enough ... does not suit pop audience and coke. But it is suitable for Homer's codes and reflections of existence. <br /> <br /> In Italy, a very good DVD version was recently released: INTEGRAL, in excellent color. You can find it in some sharing files, but it is only Italian, without translations. Too bad: dialogue boxes and sounds of this movie are also wonderful.
