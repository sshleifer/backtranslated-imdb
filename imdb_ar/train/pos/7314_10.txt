The first time I saw this movie, I signed in fine. It was the atmosphere that caught my attention first and foremost. I was expecting a gora festival, but instead, I saw a high-spirited killer mess in my head to chilling soundtrack music (it's actually resonant at the moment: P). The fact that I could not predict the date of his death and when he disappeared, was a big addition to my book. The horror movies expected me. Now, I know that the story of the story had some contradictions, but if you are like me, you will not notice it until long after the film is finished and you are sitting in bed revolving around the fact that you only saw a masterpiece in a motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It is one of the favorite play results of all time, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie was leaving her unchanged in the remake. Speaking of the new version, I read a very comprehensive article on this subject, and now that I know that Mr. Zombi sanctifies John Carpenter, I have high hopes to take on this classic story. It's great at any time you want to prick your spine, but it's a perfect addition, opener and finale, and you can call it in the All Hallow's Eve marathon. :)
