In the near future, the average man is assigned over any suspicious suburb of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northham) by Digicorp, a huge company, to be assigned as a spy and stealing secrets from their rivals, Sunways. Along with his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assuming a new identity for Jack Theseby and traveling to boring lectures. In one, he was approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advised him that there was nothing. Morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise to me. This film is not released in Brazil, but the thriller is very complex, containing many plot points, with script, directing and great performances. In the latest development, Arnold Schwarzenegger recalled "a complete recall." Sure, this film deserves to be seen more than once, and I did not like the last scene, when the independent spy gets rid of the disputed disc at sea. You know only the director Vicenzo Natali from the wonderful movie "Cube", and this second work I see is also amazing. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): Not available
