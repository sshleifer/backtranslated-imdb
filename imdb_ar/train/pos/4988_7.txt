Manz Castle is located in one of those settlements built on Jerry on vacant land and gardens that were called at these times "Hoferville" named after our sad 31 unfortunate president who was stuck with the Great Depression that took place in his administration. This film suggests that the man's house is still his castle even if it is just a hut in Hoferville. <br /> <br /> Tracy Spencer has such a cottage and the truth is told to this guy even in good times that they work all that much. But in part very typical of Tressi before being represented as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of a series of classic roles, he plays a good, soft and gentle mug that takes Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One of the things about man's castle is that it shows the effects of depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional pressure. If men were having trouble finding work, women faced a double difficulty. They were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in the face of this type of problem and does not demand it in his castle. Soon after they are in love, Tracy is not the kind of person that settles. <br /> <br /> The scenes of love had some extra suspense for them because Tracy and Young were having an affair while filming a castle man. Both Catholic and married, and in those days it was an insurmountable obstacle to marriage. Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the entire camp, Marjorie Rambo who was going through all the dilemmas that Wong might face and to guide her clear and Arthur Hohl, crawled really hateful who appointed him to the young as well. Hohl brings a human castle plot to its climax through his schemes. <br /> <br /> Castle Man is a gloomy look to the Great Depression, not the usual fugitive fare for those trying to avoid this kind of reality in their spare time.
