British comedy tends to fall into one of two main types: quiet study, meditation, usually romance, and comical social ridicule. The settings, characters, and concepts vary, but some characteristics place the vast majority of offers in one category. Butterflies may be the first type extract. <br /> <br /> The texts are very oral, including the long internal monologues of the main character Rhea, a fundamentally happy but unstable housewife about what she missed when she began her traditional life altogether. When she meets with a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his attention very clear to her), she manipulates the idea of ​​discovering what the other path might have been. <br /> <br /> Representation and texts are always on the money, making one's reaction to the show almost entirely personal: I was not explosive and did not extinguish. My mother, on the other hand, loves this show. I think the degree to which the individual corresponds to the Ria dilemma is the most important factor in determining the individual's response to the butterflies.
