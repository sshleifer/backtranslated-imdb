What do you not like about this film? Every year you learn that you will get a movie or two tidal movies during Christmas time and most of them will be terrible. This movie is definitely a new idea a new well pulled. Very funny take on a rich guy pushing the family to simulate the real Christmas for him. What's the benefit of getting money like that if you can not do it. It was a win-win situation. The regular family gets six numbers and the rich man tests Christmas as he imagines. Only if it was very difficult to deal with Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his ridiculous demands. It was a fun and funny film.
