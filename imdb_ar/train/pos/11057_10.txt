I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. So far my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Pastido was just fantastic .... I just ask the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have great powers. They only had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). The 3 actors were very good at their rolls, very believable. There was a good story in each episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was supposed to be good, and the characters they performed were fantastic. There were no fancy things, as in other programs. They did not try to make a joke every two minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
