I liked this movie when the man who was wearing a $ 40 million bank robbery dies. His cell phone uses a "house" to lead them to a crazy, high-tech killer partner (by having a device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge). It's a spy-type movie with enough comedies to keep it light. The enemy of the state reminded me. Acted well and plot well enough.
