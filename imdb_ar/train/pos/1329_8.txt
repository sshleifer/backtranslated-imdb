I grew up in Brazil and was used to visiting the wonderful coast where the film was filmed. The area is called Paraty, part of the "green coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film returns to life in the sixteenth-century world of Brazil, where Europeans have barely begun to explore the coastline, which was still primitive and low-populated by various indigenous tribes. The French and the Portuguese fought each other for the land and for the upper hand on the Brazilian timber trade, all while negotiating with the indigenous people, who also fought each other for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> An unsuitable Frenchman ("a mercenary leaves") to die at the hands of his compatriots, but runs the escape and remains imprisoned by an indigenous tribe naked. While the "slave" of the leader, according to the customs of the tribe, allowed him to live in relative comfort for several months until the time is right for him to kill and eat in ritual revenge. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is that it recreates in detail the lover of the aboriginal villages and their way of life (they were walking naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize life and accept it at those times as it was: in a magnificent garden of Eden, Life was chaotic and violent and full of pathetic superstitions and strange customs. Europeans arrive and attend their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no "nebulons here" or "trailblazers" here, just people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is not sympathetic to the indigenous people and does not reject it. From what I know about the subject, photography is fairly accurate, which gives a unique atmosphere to the project: How many films have you seen regarding the lives of Brazilian citizens and their early affairs with Europeans?
