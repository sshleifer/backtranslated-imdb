Jim Belushi is great as "Average Joe" gets 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael was a bizarre barter who not only listens to Belushi's "story", but has a "cure" for all the problems of the middle class in Belushi: a magical potion to bring about a series of changes in the life of Belushi. <br /> <br /> The footage shows a 15-year-old man terribly ashamed of causing his defeat at the junior baseball championship. Baloch goes on in his "unfortunate life," apparently happy, but always wonders "what if ..." For what seems like a few days, Balushi lives a "different" life, full of success, admired and hated by others for equal measure. <br /> <br /> This is not a "wonderful life" completely, but some elements are very similar and very loving. "The end" is predictable, but it is still satisfactory. Courtney Cox watched very small in a fraction of it as a "fatal attraction" - like another woman. Very nice movie!
