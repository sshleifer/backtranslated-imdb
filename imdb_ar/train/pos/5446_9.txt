National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy from the early 1980s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and some great music from Chuck Berry. When his classmate feels insulted to Walter Pellor when he graduated from high school, he takes the opportunity to avenge the reunion. One after the other haunts his classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a horny fat person, high school beauty, king of all numbers, and even an ugly lunch lady who even served all the children during high school. This movie contains a scary element and has short scenes of sexual life, so I will not recommend it to young children, but it's a great movie for young people. If you're looking for a movie with beautiful results, complex characters, or special killer effects, you may not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some laugh and lots of fun (and no one), this movie must be on your movies list to see the menu. ++
