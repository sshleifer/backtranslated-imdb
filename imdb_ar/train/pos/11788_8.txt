I really think people follow this wrong approach. First of all, I find this short film amusing and very enjoyable. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and ambiguity are beginning to suggest to the observer. Another thing that caught my attention is that it is shared with the viewer even though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played by the characters that give you some impression of a story of everything that is happening. No one else can do it better than Lynch. This is the essence of Linkism at its best. Sure, I will agree with anyone that people who start to watch this with the desire to entertain without any truly fantastic work by the viewer, will find themselves disappointed. And in good condition. Lynch is not about it. At least this aspect of Lynch is not. The person who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. At its maximum potential here and people who expect to be as amusing as they are watching anything else, will not get all that is going on around it. My mind is that the dark room revolves around tampering with the essence of your animal, and your instinctive self, by providing you with the means (image, sound, position) that you react to instinctively. It's not about happiness of any kind, it's about how to get the reaction you need. This, my friend, is pure art.
