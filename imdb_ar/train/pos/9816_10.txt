Anger is a very good movie! Robert Kolb was well in the film and was perfect for the part! It's hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do? When I saw this I thought about why they should do all these things. This is not true but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway, if you watched this movie on TV you saw it, it is good!
