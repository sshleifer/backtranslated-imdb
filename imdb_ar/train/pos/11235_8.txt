It was done wonderfully, in addition to the "new flights", it's a great continuation! Fab to see James Cowley in the latest episode "Vigil" Try it! <br /> <br /> I like the growing profile, and I think we have good alternatives for television representatives in a piece produced by a fan. This gallery is able to capture the feeling very well, since they are progressing on the road, it has improved over the years with experience and I hope with more experience, a powerful text editor, pick up in timing and CGI that HF ​​will become clearer than it already is! <br /> <br /> Good work for everyone involved! <br /> <br /> (I have a huge smooth spot for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT acting), although I'm a little fed up with the "Lefler Rules." Enough already! Shelby is great (if it's a bit close) (Like Fred Flintstone), but lacks the bold edge of a commanding officer and does not seem to be Doc, Chancellor, and Rawlins right in the money in my eyes, as Nechayev is wonderful (what a beautiful tone - real Russian! (Well, I guess Rene is descended from the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> Gets my vote, and CGI is a kewl.Some of the greenscreen is clear, but on a small budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, some acting is not great but it's made by fans and therefore allows it to be variable - sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay material is very thick (Graham Norton will be awkward.) The trip does not pay much attention to heterosexual couples so why do homosexuals signal with each snogging? It is not necessary to show someone's sexual activity to this extent - I hope to mitigate its effect and allow Aster & Zen to be people who do not code - I do not treat my gay friends in a different way, they're just ordinary players. <br /> </ p> <p> Musicically it's a mixed bag. I can tell all about the things Trek OST works on and most of the time, but the timing can be fixed now and then (miss the end of the "Worst Part II Faces" crisis, and modify. ! <br /> <br /> Definitely can not wait any more!
