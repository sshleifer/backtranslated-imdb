Yes this is class B horror. But at least the producers, directors and crew do not pretend that this is the sky. The plot is a grain, a serial killer of a psychotic on its way to execution with genetic acid turning it into a snowy man. Snowman, a. Jack Frost, continues the murder frenzy to find the mayor of the small town he has finally arrested. With a limited budget the crew had to do with limited special effects, and most of the money seemed to be spent on the snowman costume. Snapshots are particularly difficult to manage via a cartoon or remote stills (clips where the camera moves away to hide detail). <br /> <br /> This is a movie not for children and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you do not allow your children to watch PG-13 movies on their own from parents, their children should not watch this movie. This film has two claims to fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) has done her first major film role. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth deserves to be seen several times. 2. This movie has the worst snow joke ever. The prank is so bad that the board members owe a joke to the credit list.
