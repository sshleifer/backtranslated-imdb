Che: The first part was a great experience, which not only told a very interesting story, but I also tried to do something different with the "biopic" type .Che: The second part is an excellent crowning for this experience. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same features from the first one, from extraordinary performances (especially Benicio del Toro) to the direction of Stephen Soderberg, without forgetting his intention to go out with the traditional rules of biology. This is what I am impressed by the experiences of Soderbergh ... They always try to do something different and unusual, and succeed most of the time. <br /> <br /> The final message of this film is perfect, and includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara's life. The only failure I found in Chi: the second part is that some parts felt a little unimportant. <br /> <br /> In short, I give Chi: The second part is a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and wonderful iment experience that defies the spectator and leaves us thinking.
