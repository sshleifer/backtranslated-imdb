Dick Clement and Ian La Fernace have a great success rate with regard to their television work. However, their film works were much closer (the Job Job in 2008 was good, and last year the world was undoubtedly weak, for example). <br /> <br /> Crazy, fortunately, remains a great success. It has a great story, excellent shows, lots of humor, wonderful music and, above all, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I taste "Moments", and this movie contains one of them - only when everything goes pear-shaped in a festival reunion show ... <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
