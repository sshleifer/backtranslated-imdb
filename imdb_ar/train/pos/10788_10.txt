The great rocky mountain is amazing dessert. I saw it when I was young, and I still do it to this day. If you can imagine the sky, that's what it looks like. I hope to live in a rocky mountain where candy grows on trees. Professor Zach Heyman, my favorite friend. Little Rabbit Fu Fu is the man. It is so mysterious and colorful that I dream of it at night. In fact, my 18-year-old friend saw him for the first time and loved him perfectly. I recommend that people of all ages watch this movie. I am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this amazing film. We are on our way to order pizza and watch the bears laugh. I always find myself watching the clouds and wish I were that little girl who got the visit. thanks. Good-bye.
