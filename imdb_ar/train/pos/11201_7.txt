An amazing early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. This film is one of Hitchcock's original masterpieces, and shows a wonderful story structure. The game begins with an exciting boxing match where Jack loses a "one-round" carnival to his opponent from a seemingly professional audience. Then the film slows down to develop the characters and present a love triangle between Jack and his daughters and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic build-up for the return match between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and stent. The leadership badge that the girl bought by the boxer continues throughout the film as a symbol of her betrayal. The only major drawback in this film is that the shooting of the boxing match is not yet complete in 1927. As a result, the final result, as a result, ends up to some extent in the face of the climate. The story, however, is what bears this film.
