This may be the best film ever made, and if not, it is certainly one of those who burn on your pupils because what Brian de Palma presents here is a great cinematic work. First, there is a touch of director Brian De Palma who once again proved that he may be one of the best directors ever, and there is a wonderful performance by the Pacino who presents an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different (violent) You will never forget them (those in chainsaw, the ones where Tony sits in a large tub like the living rooms of most people), there are many wonderful scenes (calculate how often "f * ck" is used) The American world who cries "Your world is") or the great irritation of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing that can be called is not Semitic here, and it is easily considered "Godfather", "Sons of Good" and "White Heat" one of the best bands ever made!
