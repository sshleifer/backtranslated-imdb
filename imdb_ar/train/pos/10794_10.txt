I always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in the film. Although acting may not be great, the fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Godson Mills lead alongside him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers have proven that they are great artists and this was another good production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
