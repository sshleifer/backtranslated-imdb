This is the first film I have seen for John Singleton, a good director. The film begins with a group of new students and shows what happens to many of them. Omar Ebs plays a part-time star with a partial grant and has trouble keeping up with his work. He is a friend of Ice Cube and objects dating to Tyra Banks. Christie Swanson is a rich girl raped and became a friend of Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian, unsure of which way to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls in with a group of neo-Nazis and their leader Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who is trying to help them. It is a wonderful film and it is unfortunate that the studio had to make many presentations on the film.
