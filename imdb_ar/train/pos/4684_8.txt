Peter Matte "Love in Time of Money" is an amazing film. Mr. Matte gives us a vivid picture of human relations. This film seems to tell us what money, power and success are doing to people in the different situations we face. <br /> <br /> Since this difference in Arthur Schnitzler's play is about the same subject, the director moves the action to the present time in New York where all these different characters meet and continue. Each one is related in one way or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. Stylish, the film has a sophisticated luxury look. We have come to see how these people and the world in which they live live in their own environment. <br /> <br /> The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of the unity that each individual lives. The big city is not exactly the best place for human relationships to be a sincere achievement, because a privileged person is the case with most of the people we met. <br /> <br /> Good acting under the direction of Mr. Matte. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and other talented actors, make these characters come alive. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and eagerly awaits his next job.
