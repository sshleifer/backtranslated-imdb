This story is a complex and fascinating tale of the last harem of the Ottoman Empire, and has told us well and provoked that we see the inner works of a world that are now gone, and know the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoy story, characters, acting and scenes. Some scenes that suffered from rapid editing and sub-titles sometimes disappeared very quickly, otherwise they were a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character Safia played wonderfully by Mary Jilin who I am pleased to say he did a great job without exaggeration. The scenes with her and Alex Dikas (rare) are charming and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone looking to see something less than Hollywood and more authentic to the world they imitate.
