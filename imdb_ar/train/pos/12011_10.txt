I was amazed by the negative comments I read and I can only assume that the people who wrote these comments were less than honest. This is the most exciting picture of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was so good that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie. Joseph's life brought hardship, good optimism, a constant faith in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice of life in a way that left me frankly without words and silence in awe. If anyone, of any Christian religion, can see this film without touching it in a positive way - I would say it is a reflection of the individual and not of the film. I give the film "10" and encourage honest souls to watch it. In the end, at least, it is a very sensitive image of man who gave everything he had to what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are mocked, this film is a constant reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be - no matter what religious beliefs we hold - Anne Bruett -
