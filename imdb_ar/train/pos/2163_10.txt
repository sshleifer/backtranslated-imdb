I simply love this movie. It is an ideal example of the sudden stories of Asian cinema. There was a remake of Hollywood's recent film, with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez simply. Please do not confuse the two films. The original Japanese film is influential, hidden and acted wonderfully. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was astonished when I saw the video for the first time from the new American version that he was starring. It's typical Hollywood commercial unusual at worst. The new edition reinforces the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason why the original film is not widely seen is the public's aversion to translations. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for this film will never work in an American novel is that the reserved and highly conservative personality of the Japanese public character is in the case in this film. Surely the main character wakes up to a full understanding of living a lively life through dance, but half the tension of the film comes from stereotypes and satirical dancers in the dance floor of Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try watching this movie in its original form, not full screen terrible. And please do not skip the re-making of the United States ... It's a shallow farce compared to the original Japanese film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the original movie is older, and this is simply a Japanese story, but it is likely that the only two people will soon see this new version and the new American. <br /> <br /> When talking about foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I This was included first for a reason, a great movie! 2. Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian wrong identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean work pic which mixes both the Asian plot and the American style 4.Run Lola Run-A German film integrates it's Techno brilliantly records. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway: -)
