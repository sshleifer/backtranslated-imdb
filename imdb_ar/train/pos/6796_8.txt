ZÃ¼dik Keller (2005) was an exciting film by German-born director Ole Lommel. Directed, produced and co-stars in this latest production. Not only can he make an interesting film cheaply. But he reaches a new low when he works in his film catalog almost entirely. I've seen movie clips from Boogeyman I, II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes the engraving from behind the grave with permission from this film). Although it uses a lot of old footage, it works well (and has been added very creatively). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original version of the Zodiac Killer. It also corresponds to the writer Ole Lomile, originally written about serial killer during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Friend Writer (David Hess) helps him try to find this wannabe zodiac. Can you stop this killer? Will the author be gathered between two and two and regain some of his old glory? Is David Hess still the guy? You'll have to find out for yourself and watch the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br /> This movie does not revolve around the original Zodiac killer. I've also heard people complain about filming this movie on video. So what. The artistic style of the old school of the director surpasses the fact that it was filmed by video. My only complaint was the overuse of stock footage from former Herr Lemel films (but I understand why "wink" "wink".) Incredible hype. This is a brave horror film and street level. Such as disclaimers in the first cases, this film does not glorify murder. You liked this statement. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Ulli Lommel fans.
