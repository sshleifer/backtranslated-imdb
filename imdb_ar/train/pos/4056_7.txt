Watch this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I've enabled translations and I think SBS provided their own information for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just looked at "Laputa" on Wikipedia and emphasizes what I thought it was ... The floating island of this story is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's Trips", published as early as the mid-eighteenth century. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an attractive Japanese fantasy story, featuring an English speaking voice cast. I think it is suitable for young children, but it lasts for more than two hours only, so it may be very long for some, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story relates to two years of children seeking to find a legendary floating island with a castle on them. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and spies are looking for the island too, and are looking to catch the children (Chita, the girl, expressed by Anna Pachin, and Paso, the boy expressed by James van der Beck) in order to help them find the island. It. <br /> <br /> The graphics are wonderful ... sometimes a kind of realistic picture, especially the stone work scenes lit by the torch, or the beautiful scenes on the bright days, with white clouds, or mist. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
