Year 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. There is only one friend who has Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old passionate man. He leads a herd of cattle with them. Their key to wealth. In Skagway, they face a problem when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff must get her back and lead her across the Canadian-American border to Dawson.Now they have a group of other people they have, like Miss Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Fallon (Corinne Calvette). There are two men entering the gold trade. Anton Manz and James Stewart, The Fourth Collaboration, The Far West Country (1954) is truly fantastic. Wonderful acting work. Walter Brennan makes a great friend of Stuart. Ruth Roman is wonderful and Cournette Calvette is exhilarating. Jay C. Fleben is very good like Dawson Marshall Rob Morris. Jack Ilham and Kathleen Freeman appear in smaller roles. It's great to watch how Jimmy Stewart gets over the problems on his way. There is only the man and his rifle. But it is also vulnerable.
