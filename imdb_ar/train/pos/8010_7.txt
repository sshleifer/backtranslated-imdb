I previously thought that this film was lame Muppet movies. I should now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion now, Muppet's most profitable film was the television movie IT'S A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, a wonderful life that is terrifying and truly frightening. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is not something special, but miles are more fun than MerryY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song "You Can not Answer an Answer", Muppet Babies' song and the songs for the big end result. When I loved the Muppet Babies TV program, I loved the Muppet Babies series here (I was told it was an inspiration for the Muppet Babies program) <br /> <br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, the puppeteer from Sesame Street until the show for the wedding. As Kermit put it in his last line, "What's the best way you can end anything?" But I hope that what was between the beginning and the end was more fun. There is an attractive game from Brooke Shields and Gregory Heinz and a wonderful dance sequence of Rizzo and Mice (designed by the late great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly enjoys. I must say that MOVIE MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three MUppet movies selected.
