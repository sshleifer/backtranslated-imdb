Leading filmmaker Alan Reynes likes to work with actors who are part of his family. In this film also, we see members of the Reines family such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azima, André Dossoulier and Fanny Ardane dealing with such serious subjects as death, religion, suicide, love and its general effects on our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship that these people share is obvious even as friends. They treat each other with your official use. In 1984, during the work of L'amour à mort, Resnais was treated with time, memory and space to uncover the secrets of the fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? 16 years ago in 1968, Resnais produced a film somewhat similar to Je t'aime Je t'aime, which was also about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can put science in shame and restore the lovers of the dead Their lost lives leaving doctors care about her reputation. Lamour Mort is a game that is not at all educational. It is a film in which the musical result matches perfectly with its images. This is one of the reasons that this film can easily be understood.
