Again, Jet Li brings his attractive presence to the screen in Black Mask. In this film, Lee plays the role of Tsui, one of the escapees of the supernatural soldier's program that seeks to restore the humanity the program took from him. To do this, Tsui decided to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires clearing the problems of his past before he can continue to search for peace. The other members of the Super Soldier's program had fled at the same time as Tsui, but wanted to live with the world rather than find inner peace. The only thing that could prevent his former colleagues in the team from publishing information that could cost a lot of innocent people lives. The film screams across the screen at a feverish pace and never lets his audience leave. Martial arts are amazing, but because they use wires, it may not be as much appreciated as the American public deserves. If you love motion movies that have an interesting story and require good performance because they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, Black Mask will suit you. I'm happy to see that some Jet Li movies are finally on a major broadcast in the United States, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the changes that this release (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of Li's best films, released and seen on May 14 when it is released in America.
