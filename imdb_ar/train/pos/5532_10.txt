I may be biased to foxes, fox stories, but I thought this was done nicely. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it when Lily was uncomfortable, like the fire and the room (do not try to spoil a lot here). I think it is important that children see and try to understand it. <br /> <br /> After reading some other comments, I feel a bit confused, one of them says that in the end, the mother and her son appear, and she tells her son about her story. The film I saw did not have a mother or son at the end, but a painting for a fox girl. Can someone enlighten me? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow and it may be difficult for high-energy children to sit in it. Still worth it if they can still sit down.
