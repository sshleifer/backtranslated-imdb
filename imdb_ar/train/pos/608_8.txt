While seeing this movie, I was a bit skeptical because fairy films are not always a cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I did not know I was on a journey through cinematic magic. It was all in the film, from conspiracy to dialogue to influences, almost entirely from perfection. <br /> <br /> Clare Danis shines like the star in this movie. From beginning to end, fall in love with this character more and more. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer threatens to be an evil witch determined to take the star for youth and eternal youth. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a beloved figure who gives the audience the greatest satisfaction with comedy as the film gains momentum. <br /> <br /> In general, this film surprised me and pleased me as a movie fan. If you're looking for a fun and fun movie that will be fun for kids and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
