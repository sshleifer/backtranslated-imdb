This is wonderful - great acting, groups, clothes, music - but most of all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there are no more reviews for this film - certainly one of the best of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It is also a wonderful film to watch along with the great "random harvest" that suffers from the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - World War I of World War I is not known as an officer in a hospital in The end of the war, suffering from shell shock and complete memory loss without any idea of ​​his name, origin, or anywhere he belongs to - proves to be a very wealthy man - when he "recovers," I will not remember the years before the war - > But there is a similarity between the films. <br /> <br /> Many thanks to everyone who took part in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Anne Margaret (what a wonderful and surprising choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This person stays with you forever.
