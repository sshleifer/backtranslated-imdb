After having to sit through some of the real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Worms Fry". For once, I did not guess the end! He was funny and mushy and did not resort to much humor, despite the title. My children (6 and 10 years old) also loved her - my 45 year old son was smiling at him all the time. This is a family film that is not only accepted by parents. The relationship with the little brother is very close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to annoy me !!" Also, the way the new child tries to make friends and how these friendships actually form the way children behave. Of course parents have to behave a little bit stupid - but my favorite scenes include my dad getting used to his new job. Enjoy!
