When I watched this movie, I began to see his characters evolve, I felt that this would be an excellent picture. When you feel this feeling, and the film fills those expectations already, the experience is rare. I had this same feeling throughout this film. Robert Denero and Cuba Gooding Jr. played strong and surprising parts that were worth the Oscar. The support team was equally equal, creating a profitable basis for the image to grow. I can say without hesitation at all, see this movie will not disappoint me.
