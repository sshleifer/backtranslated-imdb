This movie is funny, enchanting, and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons, so I simply accept it as it is. In his unusual style, Peng succeeds in performing the Blacksmiths, Hank Martin, who was accidentally transferred to another era, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Ronda Fleming snatches like Alessande, or Sandy, an object of Hank's emotions even though she is kidnapped into the brave and brilliant Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just loved that episode when I loved King Arthur, Cedric Hardwick, Wm. Bendix, and Bing Crosby wore clothes full of descent and heading for the highway with their hand luggage to experience the kingdom. directly. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we are not alone" with his exotic clothes given a good scratch, is one of those fun moments in the film. The portrayal of William Bendix is ​​ridiculously ironic, not to mention his strange attempts, "Old English." <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but good in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It is also wonderful family entertainment. <br /> <br />
