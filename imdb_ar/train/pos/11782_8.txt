I do not know if this has any spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk blacklisting until 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not fully agree with the comments of viewers who described guns, spores and steel as "true Politically "and" the new Marxist ". They can not see the same string you saw * I *. <br /> <br /> I watched the series * I * saw the history of European colonization in the Americas and South Africa without any inaccurate information. I did not see anything in this series that portrayed the Europeans as bad people. They were lucky, although the Europeans were so lucky. I do not see indigenous peoples as poor, innocent little things. If anything, the Incas were arrogant - as you would expect any leader to deal with foreigners, if his country was not occupied in the living memory of any other world power. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I have seen nothing to be interpreted as the new Marxist or Marxist, except for the most unbelievably flexible imaginations. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples have an internal immunity against malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. While they were at the height of their successes, the civilizations of the Aztecs, Mayans and Incas were * advanced * like others in the world - and wealthy; sometimes more so. * The indigenous population and the inhabitants of Khoe San have been eliminated from smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; European colonists have also been eliminated from tropical diseases such as malaria. (Note: The people of Kho San are quite different from all the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa.) <br /> <br /> So, I do not see what other commentators complain about. The only thing I can find is that the series does not tell me anything I did not know by the time I finished seventh grade. There is nothing really new in the way of historical information in this film. However, it offers some nice dramas of events, such as the Inca opening; the production values ​​are very high; they fill some holes here and there that are not covered in Ms. Gruber's class of social studies at 6 pm at Milan Preparatory School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, assuming you have a decent place for primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a fun time to review what you have already learned (or should be Have learned) as she reaches high school.
