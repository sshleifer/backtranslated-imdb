Despite his somewhat gentle nickname, it is a mild adolescent drama. Unless you are an old sheep, you may find it loved. It is not good at developing personalities or attitudes smoothly. When you see it, you feel like you are running back and forth to the kitchen even if you are sitting watching all the time. This is one of those films that are highly admired by your character and are attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many, I know, but I've always loved Maddy Kurman's most obscure. Adolescents get most of the screen time without too many interventions from these annoying adults. Am I just or do most young people look so much alike?
