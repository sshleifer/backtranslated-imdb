I recently purchased this movie with another set of LaserDiscs from eBay. I am usually in the movies of war and movement, but sometimes I enjoy romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with today's FX movies and the ultra-bright romantic comedy, you should check out "Shop Around the World" on a quiet evening. What I like about the film is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or buzz about them. Take Mr. Matushik, for example: when he discovers that his wife is betraying one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not only because of humiliation but because he was unfair in Stuart's character. (Well, a strange example). <br /> <br /> Yes, film concentration is tight and the plot is predictable. However, I was very impressed. If you like Notting Hill, you'll want to shop near you. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
