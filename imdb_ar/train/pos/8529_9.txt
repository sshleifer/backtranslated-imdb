I ran through this movie on television and could not stop it. Peter Sellers plays the role of an unwelcome colleague located in the Goldie Mort (very warm and nice). The way Goldie's character carries herself from the beginning of the film to the extraordinary ending even today. This film gave me a different angle in human relationships and I found it very funny. Peter Sellers' role was a tough sell, but I think it works well.
