I can give you four reasons to see this film: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best directors in contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, linked to a large scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. The team is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection about the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (Potential vandals) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens the film with a good story in a comedic mood about the power of blackmail against regular people and still expects to be appreciated for its efforts. <br /> <br /> Antonio Serrano becomes even more dramatic in the second part with the heir to a story of modern Italian realism with the "Tale of Peter and Wolf" like the tale. <br /> <br /> In the third story, which appears even more independent of the series even in context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man in the wrong place at the wrong moment. But after the recent execution in Talawak and the tradition of this terrible issue in the state of Mexico, this story can not be further updated. <br /> <br /> In the end, Fernando Sarinana returns to the dark humor of the "Grand Final", which brings together most of the characters from previous sequences in one of the best clips ever. Saryana retrieves the last scene from one of his previous films "Todo el poder", and presents the final lesson of the subject. Incidentally, the scene that steals the film with Anna Siochetti gives us a brief introduction. <br /> <br /> Once the movie is over, you will feel bitterness about looking at a good (and possibly enjoyed) movie with a very painful subject. They say that people in Mexico laugh at their silence and this is the best example. This film is a testimony to how Mexicans learned to live in the midst of a crime (and perhaps kiss it), between firefighters: criminals and so-called corrupt authorities. Even this film represents a wishful thinking because almost all the good people were victims of the crime and were not harmed. If you are attacked without being scratched, you are lucky. In the meantime, do not lose the chance to watch this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful life in Mexico ...
