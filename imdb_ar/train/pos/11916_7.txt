With all the "adult" hints in the current family movies, it's good to see one you do not have to worry about and just sit and enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, this movie may contain a few sworn words (there is the time Knox divides, but they do not allow you to hear the full words), but for the most part this film is as clean as it is coming (this includes movies from the back of the day) . Not only that, but it's very fun, and one of my favorites, and a wonderful film and fun and watching with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have in front of this film is that it is very short and I hope there will be more memorable parts in it, and I will not mention it because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> All in all that was done well and a great movie to watch so get out and get the kids, make some cookies, and watch this movie!
