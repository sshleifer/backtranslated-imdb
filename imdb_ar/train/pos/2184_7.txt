Despite being a good enough musician, what I am commenting on in this film is the unexpected comedy chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as a composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. He played a highly fragmented artistic character (far removed from his familiar roles whether he was threatening the bad guys or making Holmes feel comfortable), Rathbone's character seemed unable to find his way out of bed without help. This help is Starbuck, played with his usual humor by Oscar Levant. When Crosby is appointed as a ghost writer for songs, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, "He does everything I think of me." , Levant responds to him, "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course, this is going on (or more) Rathbone, who is very concerned about where his next song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be very funny! Too bad he had no more opportunities to showcase his comic talent.
