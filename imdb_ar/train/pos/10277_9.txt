It's almost a perfect movie. Mamet will repeat the ideas, but she did not tell her in a nutshell. This is in fact about the failure of trust and the humanitarian situation. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, nobody is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this play in our society, every day? The film is very structured like Hitchcock's film. But there are no innocent people. The world is now totally polluted and destructive and everyone is involved in this friction. Can anything be healthier? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. that's cool.
