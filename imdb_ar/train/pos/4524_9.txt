This is a very rare example of a film about the opposite sex (of different sexes). The film deals with the subject of taboos so as to sympathize strongly with its public who does not know sexual intolerance at all. Adrian Passard is very reasonable like Gerald / Geraldine and you should not forget this wonderful work. Christopher Munger's output is very sensitive, dealing with such an exceptionally difficult issue and written in a good story. Not a big movie, not a "technical" film, but a great movie!
