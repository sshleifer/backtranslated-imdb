There are many films related to the Second World War, but Mother Night is very special. In this film, we learn about Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of spy. More specifically, CIA agent Maj. Wertman (Goodman) recruited Campbell, who became Nazi propaganda for the highest rank in Hitler's regime. However, the deal is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for reasons of national security, and thus Campbell becomes a hated figure throughout the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and pursues him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but he can not do much to break down the events of the poor Campbell. <br /> <br /> The story is very impressive, and we see the tragedy of Campbell, who, though a great patriot, Treats by contempt by everyone who surrounds him. Not only that, but gradually he realizes that even people close to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with an impressive ambience, with Campbell's desperation that almost captures and chokes the sights. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; it is better than "pain", although in both roles tragic characters play self-destructive destiny. Cheryl Lee is also excellent, and can say the same for representatives generally in general. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not assess how the film compares it. Anyway, this is something of no importance here: My criticism is on the film itself, and the film is sincerely worth 9/10.
