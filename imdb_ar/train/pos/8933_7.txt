Claire Dennis has repeatedly proved that the film does not need to tell a story, and that it is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them as he pleases. <br /> <br /> Ostensibly, in a non-linear film, there is an old man living on the Franco-Swiss border, a loyal man of his dogs. He still has a lover, but his heart condition is increasingly threatening his life. He has a son with a small family that meets him frequently, but when he discovers he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and revive the long-lost relationship. With a son who had formed a Tahitian woman for years. <br /> <br /> What Dennis does with this outline of the story is to use her camera to explore the unity of the soul, the breadth of nature, the interaction of man with people versus animals, and so on. The film is often illogical, but that's because we're trying hard to connect all of the points in front of us with beautiful pictures. Life is like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, heal, and make what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this kind of filmmaking (as I did in the beautiful alien "Beau Travail") Claire Dennis developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer finds the final product rewarding, it is often associated with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. It's a fun and engaging movie, but many viewers will find it too long a speech about very little. The view may change again. Grady harp
