Garam Masala is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is as excellent as a slut who has affairs with 3 girls and participates at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes entertaining, and this is one of his best works so far. Parish Rawail is as wonderful as usual in most of his films. Brideshan has delivered great films in the past. Hera Ferry, Hengama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is the most extreme film of his. The three new actresses are average. Remy Sen does not get a big field in this film. I was impressed to see how Preadarshan made a film with a simple story about a man who had three girls at the same time. All three girls have a leave on the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with lots of laughter, this is one non-stop entertainment.
