*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, it was considered absolutely lively at the time, and Douglas is still circling the top of color melodrama. The plot is to go ahead with the rich oil-rich Texas family, which includes Kyle, who is very insecure, weak, wounded and alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very moving and playable performance, and his little sister Marley played the most in Dorothy Malone. Ms. Malone's performance is shown across the cable through her eyes, which she uses to show us her feelings, which consist mostly of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in films that enter the eyes room first. Now do not get me wrong, its performance is that, to say the least, it was just an absolute, one of the top jobs of the fifties. But this is also terrible, because they are as attractive and attractive as Malone, they are not very well represented, they are unable to thumb or shading. Her patio is one note. She does the wicked Mambo, and in the form of a wonderful vehicle, where the beloved father, always played by Robert Keith at his death as he climbs the stairs, mixes a circus between him and Malone almost crazy as he dances. Stack (who should have won the Oscar) and Malone (who won the award, but should not be) are the real stars in the film, who put all the hysteria, both sexual and in motion, while the "real stars" of the film, Hudson and Buckal To the gray and brown, the colors they wear mainly. Hudson, who was the best actor and then credited with running the children's plays and best friend of Stack, and the chasers loved Malone's attention who complained of rocky ears during most of the film. But Hudson does not want any part of her, and instead she likes Buckal, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is happy for a long time. Stack-Bacall's marriage breaks up a lot after a year, and Stack drinks himself a lot in oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and can not give Bacall a child to prove he is a man. Sirk, who was a smart man and had a long and fascinating career in both film and theater in Germany, completed his Hollywood career in Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of brightly colored "women's films" or "melodramas." Although they were mainly derived from medical source material or source of garbage, they were in the hands of Sirk became masterpieces of this kind. Sirk had a wonderful sense of the color and design he played in these films, filling his wide screen with characters who lived their emotional life between color combinations and exotic lighting, and made impressive shadows, and a lot of irrigated reflections. In "written" writings, characters are always out of windows, listening to or sneaking into doors. So in the end, after a lot of violence, casual death, abortion, and more, the circus ends with a final and stunning scene of "Reborn" and Malone fixes a man-made suit and sits on a desk clutching a miniature oil grille.
