This was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about eccentrics. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi and Ben Stiller were the two stars, although a handful of actors shared nearly the lights, in this farce about superheroes. Paul Robbins was the most famous film "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, cheerful colors and calmness. It is a beautiful, entertaining and lightweight comedy with no characters but clumsy figures, all of whom want to be heroes like Superman, Batman and Spiderman. They have talents in strange areas, but real heroes do not (and do not want to!). It's ridiculous, but you know that this is happening. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie you can watch in installments and do not miss any continuity. It is a long film for a very overheated person, so a break here and there is fine. The language was so relaxed that children could enjoy it too. In fact, I do not remember any section to swear here, except for the guy who was in the theater next to me who kept saying, "What a stupid and polite film." I thought it was fun for two hours but I would rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
