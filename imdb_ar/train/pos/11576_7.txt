Trying to be an epic adventure in the century. With cast members such as Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, they are indeed the perfect B adventure of all time. It is indeed an enjoyable and enjoyable adventure that attracts your interest, even with its flaws. It must have felt like the biggest movie ever made for people who made it. Even if manufactured in the 1990s, it has no modern character. He has more of the same feeling that the old film Errol Flynn. The Big Adventure movie is the big thing about Hollywood, but I'm afraid it's not as old as it was. This on the other hand, just has a real feeling. You can not hate her. I think it's a good adventure film. I really liked the soundtrack. Damn, I want a theme song.
