This was my first film of the year 1991, but it was won by the wonderful JFK. This is a great movie! loved it. I like the stories in which different characters intersect with others and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Klein is good here, but Danny Glover beats him, especially Steve Martin. I have never liked Martin or his style at all, but it is wonderful here. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Cassden is, IMO, a wonderful dialogue writer, along the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he created several three-dimensional characters, well-studied story lines, and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. Really excellent movie. 4 of 4 Stars
