I wonder what the audience thought today when he put his eyes on Walter Jack Blacks for the first time. He certainly does not look like anyone else at the time, that skull-like face, flat nose, and long body - so far remains a troublesome present. And what could be more appropriate than appearing outside the crowded New Orleans slums that seem to get worse like Blackey's plague on the city. I'm just sorry because he did not have more scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was compiled with great skill? The black humor of the morgue, the Widmark-Douglas interaction, the non-tourist sites, and the battles between officials are all interwoven in a very exciting film with a threat other than the others at the time. Even the local scenes in Widmark that puts a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee can not be more troublesome. Certainly, director Kazan shows his willingness to direct the studio producer (Fox), regardless of how he feels about the commercial side. <br /> <br /> Widmark works as a low-level solid public health officer. But my money is on the only and only Mustel Zero. Was there a racemaker who could vote louder or roll over the giant supernatural man (eg, the executor, 1950). This scene with Mostel, where he argues Balances with the wife of Mostell the great (Lesotho), is a jewel of frantic dependency where Mostel tries to calm everyone like some raging pinball. Too bad he lost many years in the black list. (I wonder if Kazan is the sad one who called him a name.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just professionals who add color. Local residents add both personal and originality, especially young Asians whom the police have met. This entire scene is improvised, as if Kazan realized its potential and formed a neat little scene instantly. Then, too, this colorful rental room with all the hands of the surface is a pure inspiration. And what about those bright cafes that made me run to the nearest religious. <br /> <br /> In any event, the film is still an exciting and well-planned film of horrifying air that predicts many of today's mega-hits.
