This film is a perfect example of a film that divides people into two groups .. those who get jokes and who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This film has a comic style and an unprecedented charm. It is a wonderful comedy .. and romantic wonderful. It is an ideal history film. Perfect movie for someone who wants a good laugh. If your point of view is very tense, it may not be appropriate for you, and you may need advice. It is unfair that Paramount kept this film on the shelf since the early 1980s, when he did not see the light on the DVD. However, they feel that the urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that two of your favorite romantic comedy movies have not been released on DVD. The other is Jane Wilder, "The World's Greatest Love", which Fox has been sitting in since the early 1980s. However, "From Justin to Kelly" is found in almost every video shop in the country. There is no justice in the world. Those who have spent a lot of time enjoying "Justin to Kelly", I'm sure the water will have been settled enough to "get". Sometimes, people lose their sense of humor ... or sometimes it becomes old and they find it a pleasure to be at Full House.
