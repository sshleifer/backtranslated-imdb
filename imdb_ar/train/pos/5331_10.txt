Just watch it on Sky Gap TV for the first half of an hour. I did not wonder if this was a true story, so I saw it to the end. There was no summary at the end to say what happened to everyone. He reminded me quickly but at the end of the day I do not think he was released in the cinema as we saw the next mistake. The most important thing we saw was that they were lifting the bonnet and then there were two shots of the car with the police car in the front trying to slow it when the cover came back. It made me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the child would hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was not lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears so it was not that bad !!!!
