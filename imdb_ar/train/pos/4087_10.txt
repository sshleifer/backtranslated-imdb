I must say, I thought I had seen everything. I'm a very lumine film buff. This film did not shock me in any way. I'm beyond this point. But it took me to certain emotional places I did not know I might go to. I had no idea that I had found (ick) the idea of ​​erotic excitement. never ever ever. Start. Start. But there you go. He did it. I must give credit manager. He pulled it. <br /> <br /> During the first 40 minutes, this movie became a full load. We start with some very clear shots of two horses having sex. Five minutes after this I started wondering if buying this movie was not wrong. Then an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old man about two people getting married. Then some nervous man shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot chick gets it with the butler (but that's too short). At this point I was cursing the movie loudly while trying to stay awake. In fact, I was enveloped in about 40 minutes and forced myself to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> In the end, we got goodies when a girl (know who she is or who is in this movie) has a dream about the Victorian era gal that was ravaged by a monster in the forest. The scene continues for a while and is actually the meat (hee heh) for the whole deal. They have been beautifully photographed, beautifully edited and delivered. They try to end the plot in the end, and it makes sense somewhat, but it is not. Oh, okay. Definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV) but the last 50 minutes recovered it completely.
