Taking a break from his fugitive escape in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg ordered the application of Whoopi Goldberg in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple," about the desperate existence of an African American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Sealy, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in films like "Sister Act". This is the kind of film that can be - no, make it fit - part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies. One scene may be the most important editing task displayed on the screen (you will know it when you see it). I can not believe that this has not won a single Oscar; it may be the second best film for Selberg behind the Schindler List (perhaps even linked to it). Starring Danny Glover, Adolph Cesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard Eagles, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
