I've seen a lot of Sora movies and I've always found a great way to combine music, dance, drama and great cinema into his films. Ib√©ria shows better images, dealing with multimedia concepts, the concept of dance and contemporary music. The other thing that caught my attention is the fact that the dancers, musicians, dance and music in this film are just as important: the camera shows different aspects of musical interpretation, not only technical matters, but also the emotional experience of playing. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical music, dance and dancing is another component in the transformation of this film, perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing among his other works. That's why I highly recommend it to those who like good cinema, good music, good dancing, great art.
