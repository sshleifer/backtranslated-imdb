"Still Crazy" is by far the greatest rock comedy of all time. This error was compared to "This Is Spinal Tap", which has nothing to do with it. The "Spongy Tap" is a satire (quite frankly, not very good, although it is a "picnic" for many rock cliches). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is filled by senior actors, great songs and wonderful humanitarian attitudes. You care about people in "I'm still crazy". That's all that matters. Oh, yes, very damn good music, too, written by Mick Jones of Aliens and Chris Deford of the press. The American audience was already familiar with the films of The Crying Game, but he was not familiar with Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II, and Timothy Spaul (Harry Potter films).
