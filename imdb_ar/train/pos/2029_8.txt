As a horse lover no one can appreciate this film. There are a few movies that show equestrian as does this. I would love to know if Brian is riding the movie. Would also like to know if he enjoys horses. Brian has been in a lot of movies where he has run. Where to learn to ride? The only part that is difficult for me to do is that the sights of the ride are always tilted, such as the horse running forever steam full longer filming the camera first class and picking horses in a way that shows how dangerous things on top of the horse. It would be very interesting to know how they went in filming this movie to find all the very good horse riders.
