Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember well the original Hark of Zu Warriors, which he made 18 years ago. During one of the birthdays, in a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK featured a week of Hong Kong movies, Zou Warriors was captivating the very young viewer and his brother and was not forgotten, until he was engraved in his memory. up sprog ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors movie is one of the first films I have seen as a child that I can clearly mention the story line and motion scenes from. And memories of Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in the classic prime. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this new version of Zu Warriors, there was a sense of fear. Can he overcome the memories of my childhood dreaming of the origin, or will he follow another remake and die more horribly than the bad guys and broken necks you find in those kung fu movies? > The answer is that I can not say. But this was because this is not really a remake. Stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The story of the legend in Zou tells the story of King Sky, the only warrior whose master Dawn announces his love for her but whose life is taken. Including a monster called insomnia. Two hundred years later, insomnia returned, the dawn was embodied as a mystery, and insomnia returned to destroy Zou. White Eyebrows and Red, with the help of King Sky, are trying to stop insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists and turns, but it has enough detail to keep me interested. But I can see this movie like you either love or hate. The film revolves around special effects, most of which include multiple environments created by the computer, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two films, it was a film that did not beat the graphics and everything was great. Nothing seems rushed - unlike the hero. The backgrounds were complementary to the representation and not at all overwhelmed the viewer. <br /> <br /> The story also includes many characters and the interplay of many individuals makes the film interesting. Perhaps he was about to "have too many chefs", but generally each character had a role in the story. But some roles seem to be "extended fillings" in my opinion, leaving me somewhat of a question about the necessity of doing so. <br /> <br /> Ekin Ching and Luis Coe play very basic roles in the film, but I could not say that this film showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have matured at least in her representation, but she is still very cruel. Kelly Lin was the new revelation to me. Despite its very short role, I apologize and admit the word! <br /> <br /> In general, I must say, I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the "original". With both films being produced by legendary Tsui Hark, the two films are part of an account of how Hong Kong's film industry changed over two decades. One aspect of this is the fact that you can not compare the two films at all, apples like apples and pears are pear. <br /> <br /> In the end, both movies are quite enjoyable in their movies right. I will return to memory by watching the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to watch, but can not compare.
