"Cry in the Dark" is a witty piece of cinema, chasing, and incredibly provocative though. The real story Lindy Chamberlain, who in 1980 saw a horrific scene, saw her 3-month-old baby being brutally transported from their family tent while camping in remote Australia. I have never seen Azaria (the girl) again, and her hideous disappearance has caused a real madness of life all over the world. Merrill Streep does justice to Lindy's role, as she always does. But the only thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never falls is the wonderful direction. The truly inspired and accurate look of this puzzling case, the tears are brought to the eyes. This concept is nothing short of being terrifying, and then being left with an ecstatic, but also inspiring you.
