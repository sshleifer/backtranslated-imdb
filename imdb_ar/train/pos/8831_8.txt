Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the main actress is amazingly beautiful, the plot has little chance of acceptance because many of the stunning details face the audience during the story's discovery. <br /> <br /> One might think that middle-aged middle-school girls in the 1950s have easily abandoned their virginity without thinking about marriage from the age of 30 and they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> It's easy to give "virginity away" what about SHREWD about this film. <br /> <br /> One might think that teenagers in high school are self-confident and self-confident during their interaction With older people in complex social situations, but my experience was more often than adolescence.You feel very embarrassed and act rudely during her experience in the adult world. <br /> <br /> You just can not see the world without your eyes? <br /> <br /> One may think that a trained medical practitioner will not know the stench of stroptomycin - the secondary product of fermentation with the sweet smell of microbes I do not know that some of the bland, bland Bland powder is fake, but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> And also the opinion of "expert" emerged from the experience. The 30-year-old rioters can enter a public school hall while they are at school and cause trouble, but I think school meetings are usually a protected environment and parents and school staff will prevent it. Good sport and tell us in any institution that connects us. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the five teenage friends around Hey Babu Riba pointed out to themselves as the four. There is probably an explanation for why the five were four, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a possibility. Good job know it! Now I will be faithful and help you solve your problem: Although it has been translated as a general "four", the word "VETVORKA" has another meaning: it is a sport that is used for a long period of time. CREW consists of 5 people: 4 rows and CXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This was not a real movie for me. <br /> <br /> We must all stick to your competence and our point of view. Hey friend.
