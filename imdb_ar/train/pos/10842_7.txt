So I rented a "still crazy" instead. When the Hardcore Logo of the man described in the video store, said this kind of sounds still sounds like crazy. So I rented it. Have you been disappointed? Well, yes, since "still crazy" focuses on a classic rock band instead of a punk band, but that's good. Strange Fruit, the rock band that broke out in the 1970s at the height of its fame at the Grand Rock Festival, is still "crazy". Twenty years later, all the band members are struggling to earn a living and are given the opportunity to perform a concert on the 20th anniversary of the festival. They take the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis, touring Europe in the process. Some very funny hijinks ensue, and all the characters pass minor changes. When you watch this movie, you'll feel a more carefully edited documentary. This is not bad at all.
