I watched this film by my wife and I when it was released in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We really thought we were the only couple of gay and lesbian who had married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love may come from where you do not expect it and maybe you do not want it. But we chose this love anyway. <br /> <br /> No, our sexual orientation has never changed. This kind of thing concerns wackos Christians. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we age, we have stopped practicing outside marriage. <br /> <br /> This story is not out of reach. However, the proposal to become heterosexuals seems largely unrealistic to me. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the past 40 years. We are still gay. end of story.
