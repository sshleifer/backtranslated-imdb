I love bad movies. Not only because they are often amusing like "good" movies (such as Pirates of the Caribbean and other Hollywood movies), but they are often much better than those movies. That's why I love Italian spoiling cinema in the 1970s and 1980s. That is why I particularly like this film, The Barbarians & Company. <br /> <br /> Director Rogerio Diodato has made some very good films, such as House on the Edge of the Park, and his objection to Atlantis and Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man. But that's really bad. Barbarians is a very stupid film. Peter and David Paul as Brothers Brothers Kuchik and Jor are very funny, because they lack charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they shout and scream every time they do an important job. In one scene, people try to hang "barbarians Brothers", and they escape in a very unusual way. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, everything is really bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I saw this first time. Barbarians and society are a classic camp that everyone should see once. If you think Plan 9 From Outer Space is a fun camp, it will be a real killer.
