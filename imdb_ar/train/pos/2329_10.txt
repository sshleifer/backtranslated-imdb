"Man in the Moon" is a beautiful realistic look at life through the eyes of a teenager. The director Robert Mulligan magically rewrote Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood through superb cinematography and musical lessons. This is one of the most emotionally moving films in recent times. <br /> <br /> This film is unbelievable, it is first class, especially Sam Waterstone and the stunning performance of Ruth Witherspoon in her debut film. You will feel very emotional because this summer of life changed in 1957 at the Trant family farm. <br /> <br /> "Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991 and you will probably love the fact that most of your friends and family have never heard of it before. Buy this DVD and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is really the essence of filmmaking at its best.
