I read a small ad in some horror magazines in the early 1990s about Liebe des Totes or something similar. This of course woke up so inquisitively I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Nekromantik's films are quite good, but they are interesting and unique in their approach to the subject of Necrophilia (even if they are clearly introductions to a horror opera and are not meant to raise fear in the minds of viewers, they are actually very funny.) > TODESKING, on the other hand, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever produced. It consists of a series of scenes depicting many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; death as dwelling, death is the very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor for life. It shows the fragility of life and the shortness of our lives. It reduces its viewers to children (we) are already. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of death, and therefore not the process of death, is the main message of the film. This is the most realistic film. Do not try Buttgereit to hide death behind white roses or anything else. Regardless of the ethical standards I have prepared, death is inevitable, and sooner or later it will not be a fantasy but a reality. This applies to you, dear reader, as it applies to movie viewers. It seems that some of the reviewers are not aware of this, and this is completely forbidden, because of course they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This film is not a film exploit. why? For death does not exploit us. It harvests us. We grow for seven days, then are brought back to the prenatal state, which is death. Buttgereit gives us his novel of the oldest anecdotes. Whether you choose to be "optimistic" or "pessimistic," this is up to you. At first glance, it may sound too dark. Keep in mind that in order to live something, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I think when Buttgereit appears to be a body, consumed by larvae, it not only shows decomposition, but generates a new life. Is it better to die and give life to the worms then the birds and eventually become soil, than to remain a dead coma is one of the favorite pets of this species? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, Der Todesking it sees its proper context. <br /> <br /> The Sieben Tage hat dies Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because Reaper takes just what has come. The unapproved apples will rot for food! <br /> <br /> Enjoy a good life, IMDB'ers colleagues! <br /> <br /> (This film, which compares only to Ingemar Bergmans 'The Seventh Seal' in terms of depth and universality,
