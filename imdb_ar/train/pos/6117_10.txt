All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... If you're even a "PC" remotely or you do not have a comic sense seriously, it's likely you will not get it. Although this film is sick and disgusting, it is actually a comedy film and not a horror film at all. If you appreciate someone who is pushing the limits of good taste and political correctness to the limit of imaginable, to the extent that it is so out of reach that it becomes humiliating, you must see this believe it. This film is so out of control that a large film studio was unable to touch this with a 10-foot pole (with a condom in the end). In my opinion, the best and most accurate art pieces come from underground. If you do not adhere to the same old formula that people used to see, they would reject it. <br /> <br /> I've seen piles of awesome, boring, zero-star Indy movies that were just a waste of a good VHS tape or a DVD-R. I've also seen groups of foul-smelling bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When NO BUDGET comes out like Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro and blows all the other "Shock" movies out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the whole Indy movie scene. After watching this, you can really see how much freedom Indy Movie Maker can enjoy when they work alone. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and "hate it" admit the fact that they laughed all the way. I do not think it is possible for anyone to be bored when watching either of these. So, if you did not take everything I saw in the mainstream media seriously, and I could laugh at a wrong emotional patient, he would arrest a psychopath who finally picked up, you should see it. You may only be able to see it in a stand-alone, classic cult it. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of more than 1000 DVDs.
