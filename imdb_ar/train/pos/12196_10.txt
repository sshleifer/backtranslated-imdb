Orson Welles can hit my ass with every picture I see. The Shanghai lady is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes in the middle of the night. The plot may be confusing at times, and sometimes it seems to move very quickly (almost edited for about an hour). It does not matter, however. You can not watch Welles movies and manage too much focus on this plot. Its direction determines the great direction. Almost any scene from this film can stand up to any other scene. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually these stock scenes I can not stand on. For example, try to sit down through Wells' private speech near the end of coercion. In the lady of Shanghai, you just have to pay attention to the level of detail in the courtroom scene. See that juror who sneezes and interrupts the proceedings always. Or just look at the lighting in this scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian curtain, and it was constantly used in movies and criminal films of that era, but Wales gives it its own beauty. The dialogue is also wonderful. Wales had the skill, a skill no one else seemed to possess, to produce a crime film with examples of the finest poetry. Whether Shakespeare spoke or spit out boiled lines, he had the power to move the soul. 10/10.
