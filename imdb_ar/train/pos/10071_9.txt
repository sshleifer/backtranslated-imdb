When tradition dictates that an artist must transfer his skills and great charm to a heir, the very advanced and proud street artist, commonly known as the "King of Masks", becomes desperate to adopt a trained and dependable young man. <br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity find that he pays a few dollars for a small person displaced by devastating natural disasters in China, and in this case, the massive floods of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> His 7-year-old companion takes his straw boat to live with his beautiful precious monkey, General, to discover that the baby is her child. <br /> <br /> Life is instantly transformed, because the love it feels for this little slave girl is intertwined with the stupid tradition that requires him to pass his art to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this story ... Many people have been affected, and the culture of China opens its doors to our western eyes. Thousands of years of heritage mingle in a cup of drama, and few will leave a DVD behind with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer by itself is not great, since I found the audio levels everywhere the counter, and can actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
