One of the greatest Class B cultivars of class B and C, the Ramones (originally designed for cheap trick), Rock N 'Roll Secondary School. It is just a simple, technically dated story (but it will lead to additional doses of humor that arouse the nostalgia of the past because it was a kind of thing that made the characters of Napoleon Dynamite funny - see the Eaglebauer) about teenagers who love rock and roll. <br /> <br /> The evil school principal, Miss Evelyn Tugar, faces students at Vince Lombardi High School (played by Mary and Ronoff, the favorite candidate for worship, who fear that children's rock and roll will turn into uncontrollable perverts and vassals. In fact, you intend to eliminate rock and roll for all students, regardless of whether they are in school, and cooperate with most adults who may make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But not If Riff Randell (PJ Insoles) can help in that. <br /> <br /> From fanatics in Ramones, I have written some songs (including R School ock N 'Roll secondary) that she wants to offer to the Ramones, and in an attempt to do so, she was rejected by Miss Togar who is doing everything in her power to prevent her from going to see Rammons play in the city.It culminates in a final revolution among adults who hate fun After the years of the villain, when the fame of the garage sponsors, Ramones (and others) was a sign of another shift in the evolution of music, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all in a funny and exaggerated way. In which. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a light comedy, but it's a great comedy that feels comfortable though when you're in the mood for something more relaxed to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (from Airplane fame) and Joe Dante (from Gremlins fame) in some directions, you can get an idea of ​​the type of humor you prefer (not to mention, we expect to see Dick Miller even for a few minutes at the end of the film). The story must be inspired later (and subsequently updated) by the mid-1990s comedy, Detroit Rock City, which changed some of the secondary characters in the car to the old rock band, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I recommend passing through the Curry Feldman car, the Rock and Roll High School was launched forever, after about a decade. The original is still better.
