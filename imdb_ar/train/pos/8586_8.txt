Welcome again Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you appeared in a movie, and what it was like, was not 24, but very interesting, especially with a supporter like Michael Douglas in the lead as a besieged Secret Service agent. Kiefer's character is the one that haunts Michael Douglas the entire film, Kiefer's partner, is Eva Longoria, a desperate housewife. Wow can act along with courtship throughout the day and look good, I wish Kim Pasinger had a bigger role, but otherwise, I really think the entire movie was an explosion from start to finish. This film is what I consider political excitement, everyone played their part in the film. Nothing was detected in the film after a short period, so as to keep guessing always. I really think Kiefer did one mission here in this film, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had a great performance on this day.
