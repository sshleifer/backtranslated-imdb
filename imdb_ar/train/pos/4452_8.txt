Not affected by rejectionists. This is a wonderful neurological film. This was a draft thesis by the writer / director, GT Betty. He did a wonderful job by making me on the edge of my seat. I did not really know what to expect, and for the glamorous horror filmmakers, this is Nirvana! The film is about an old man living in an isolated wooden cabins in the forest. One day, while searching for his cat in the forest, a child is being killed, or is he? He is tortured about this remaining film. The strangest thing about this film is that there is no dialogue until the last few scenes. I found this to be interesting. The writer is able to control your senses and give them a relentless tractor. Give this movie a chance I will not be disappointed.
