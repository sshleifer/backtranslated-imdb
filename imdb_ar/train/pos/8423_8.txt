I thought Thats Bush is primarily a very armed show produced by Parker and Stone. Her often very funny, her very subversive and crazy. South Park fans will definitely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the value of production here. There must be a lot of money in this, and this shows. Lots of small details are expensive. It has no small display. Comedia Central is not a very rich channel, but it has put a lot in this show clearly. Somehow I understand that this was the death of the show, but it was very expensive. Definitely could have done cheaper and went on the will there. <br /> <br /> Critics loved it and had a small fan base, but failed to win a large audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes and I think it is almost a season. <br /> <br /> Since I was really impressed with the offer, it's flawed. The problem with the show is that he does not know what he really wants. It's like that trying to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time. The actors are doing well, some of them well represented, but in my opinion they do not always get 100% of the weird humor they are supposed to present. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the show needs some of the characters that were most on the ground for the show to work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, a kind of realistic touch in a more rational world. I think this is what makes South Park work. You need some sensible people you can relate to in a realistic way, and that makes crazy things even more interesting because it forces you to take them seriously at some level. If everything is typical and stereotyped, it is difficult to be emotionally included in the show, which is really the biggest problem you face. Kyle and Susan in South Park understand Madness in the show. We do not have something like this here, and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another prominent point is Parker Westons, who flirts with Republicans. It's the only thing about them that I do not get what they're trying to do. Bush is portrayed as nothing but a stupid character of Homer Simpsons. It's a kind of subversion in a world where so many people can not stand him and think he's the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy world from Letterman, so he does not care But with every step ... but it is hard to understand whether Parker and Stone really mean anything. It's like the humor we have, but somehow does not reach the mark. It seems embarrassing, because it does not remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, I thought the presentation was very enjoyable. Some jokes here are hilarious. A pro-life supporter who was an aborted fetus may be one of my favorite jokes in any show. The show is full of wonderful stuff, and sometimes it's funny if you use your head while watching it.
