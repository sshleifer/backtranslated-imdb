This film was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film, was not too long nor too complicated. I myself enjoyed the translation; the plot was surprisingly new. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and his retarded brother after a long separation seemed trite at first, but proved to be very influential and realistic. There was also some hidden humor so that the audience did not press or endure it.
