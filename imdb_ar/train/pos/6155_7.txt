"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, though not being one of Disney's best works. It has a good story overall, great songs, great characters, good actors, charming special effects, cheerful settings and beautiful landscapes in England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and movement very well. The animation itself, of course, very good. The animation is similar to that of Robin Hood's 1973 animated film. The same can be said about moving characters: There are lots of wild animals like bears, elephants, hippos, blacks, crocodiles and others like Robin Hood. (The Lion) is a combination of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear is like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins" with the reason, combining both direct action and animation with action They both have similar settings in London, both have his own charm and magical woman. (Curry, Charlie and The film is directed by Robert Stevenson and both are directed by David Tomlinson, but instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a fun and magic man - Professor Emilius Brown. Also on some simple and short analogies with the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> The majority of songs are good. "The Age of Non-Faith" and "Beautiful Beautiful Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also beautiful. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is wonderful again in this film. Angela Lansbury is as wonderful as Miss Price and the three actors are in very good shape: Cindy Oklagan as Carrie, Ian Weegel as Charlie (a boy in the Age of Non-Faith) and Roy Snart as his younger brother Paul. </ B> <br /> I love the black cat. It's very cool. Like Salem, the black cat from the TV series "Sabrina, the teen witch." I find it nice when a movie character turns into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love them! It's fun when Professor Emilius Brown turns into a white rabbit because when he turns into a man again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really fun, along with his comic character and this mustache. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie, but its end is very bad. The first minutes of the film are not something special, but they improve a lot. The end, however, is weak. This is my main criticism of this, in large part because the cartoon knights thing is a little too for me and also because of the sense of war.
