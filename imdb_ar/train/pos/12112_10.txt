The premise of this series of animations revolves around bread, so that all things are based on a piece of land! I really laughed. The main character has the power of making his own bread that he was born, and he goes to the bread baking school. I hope it's available on a DVD, no matter whether it's a subtitle or dubbed - it's good. Even song song alone funny. At one point of song song, there is an African man carrying Afro on horseback, and practicing baguette as if it were a sword of samurai. These images will only make sense if you see anime. You will laugh until you hurt your sides. It's definitely the most anime picture I have seen so far.
