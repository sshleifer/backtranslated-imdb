Simon Big plays Sidney Young, a young entertainer who has just begun a career writing for a grassroots magazine devoted to the mismanagement of the affluence of the rich and famous. He makes a profession of sardonic celebrities, although he has a desperate desire to be famous himself. The film is based on the highly exotic career of Toby Young, who also ran a small magazine in Britain called the Modern Review, which gave sharp criticism to everything imaginable to a large extent, until the magazine ended in a barrage of verbal bullets with his partners. - Then, he went to an amazingly unsuccessful career as a writer for Vanity Fair, a big part of his life in this film. <br /> <br /> He was initially very pleased to be working on one of the major publications (called Sharp's Magazine in the film), and despite the active nerves, he was a positive harbinger on his first day. The editor, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), who is hard as a nail, is also a kind of editor who needs to be like a fool like Young to keep his job in the magazine. Offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young, but he also has what can only be described as liberal tolerance with the oddity of Yong beyond behavior and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy in the film stems from Yang's misunderstanding of indifference or indifference towards her in the generally accepted code of conduct and the bizarre etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous. But Sydney's reasons for behaving strangely and for apparently satirical interviews is that he thinks he hates the entire celebrity culture, and seems to believe in this old saying? "If you can not beat" em ", join" em "and then" win "." <br /> <br /> Complex things are very different. There is a charming and regular girl in the magazine called Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) who was initially appalled by Sydney's obvious arrogance and feminine ways, and a stunning model called Sophie (Megan Fox), a celebrity culture. For Sophie, the character has a star-like appearance. <br /> <br /> Sophie is amazingly beautiful, she is real, but she also shows that she has no single idea spinning in her head. Alison is a normal girl, not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes her a real person. The relationship with her will see the Britney Spears marriage, but the film still has a level of credibility because we also feel Sydney's pain in not chasing her (I felt it anyway). <br /> <br /> H ow To Lose Friends and Alinate People has an interesting premise filled with honest and satisfying displays, and although they turn out to be a little of the standard romantic comedy in the third season, they include a variety of The characters are sophisticated and interesting. Danny Houston, for example, gives us a great performance as Allison's other love interest, which commemorates The Big Lebowski (also the Bridge Championship) with his ever-present Russian-Russian character, one of my favorite personal drinks. The absolute purchase and I have been here in China cost about $ 350 equivalent, but my kitchen is not without either. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the day Simon Bigg will be a little better because I like his movies but I'm not quite sure of his collection. He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but he was only serious about his madness, and finally came back to himself, which was in Shaun of the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run, and now how to lose friends. He is a rising star, and it will be interesting to know what he can do.
