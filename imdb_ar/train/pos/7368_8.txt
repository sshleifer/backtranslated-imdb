I think the team behind this film did a very good job with the restrictions they imposed. Â£ 300,000 and only 7 weeks for writing and movies and editing everything I think is an achievement in itself. Although this film is not for the masses (where a innocent little girl is murdered in the teen and there is an erotic sexual relationship in the story) I only think this film is a tragedy that strikes the heart and shares more in the story, the more sadness you feel. More to Heaton because of the love he feels but no longer. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British films that I enjoyed so much and watched again. I think it's a shame that the film has never heard very well at all.
