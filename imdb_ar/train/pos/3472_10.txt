Spoiler Very Slight <br /> <br /> This movie (despite being just on TV) is absolutely excellent. I did not really notice the differences in appearance or dialects, so I can not really comment on that. The acting was so good that I had to press myself and say, "Remember, it's just a film, it really did not happen." When I sat down and listened to the talk of Harris and Quinn, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul were talking about if they had already held this meeting. John's comments and burns were right with his character (especially in the restaurant!), As was the case of depression as Paul was walking back. Each of the actors did an excellent job and I am delighted to see this film. It's an evil experience for any of the Beatles fans. And prepare for some surprises!
