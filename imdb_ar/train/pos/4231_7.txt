As she returns from a shopping trip on Christmas Eve, a housewife of a basing victim finds herself in a struggle for survival after a row with a group of young delinquents taking a violent turn. <br /> <br /> From one indignation to a DVD version here in the UK, perhaps Susan Montford's first appearance will not be given the recognition she deserves. This is a shame, as the level of writing, output and playback is very good indeed, and certainly exceeds the quality of your average sound directly to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger performed her best performance at some time as a troubled wife for an abusive couple (Craig Scheffer). Although Scheffer does not really give anything more than just a threat, Basinger in their short scenes together shows a painful weakness, hinting at the anger that will eventually come to grips with the young. It is a truly remarkable performance, and less appreciative, its transformation from victim to aggressor has been played smoothly. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas initially thought he was wrong, because he (along with the other three young people) did not seem too threatening. However, if all four young people were physically imposing, the subsequent scenes in which Basner turned the table against them would never work. The fact that these are four middle-aged men, though not a bit shy, is the key to why the film works well. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few problems during the last half of the film and two cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer to think about when the film ends. Some may be delayed due to slow combustion in opening scenes, or sudden end. Others sometimes have brutal violence. I say give it a chance, it's definitely worth your time more than Saw V.
