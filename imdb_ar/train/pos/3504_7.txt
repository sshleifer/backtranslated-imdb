This movie looks like a movie project. As if the directors had chosen a slice of society without experience and had come to work. The characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this amateur feeling, the film is effective. It is like a cross-section of life with neighborhood children trying to perceive or care for their sincere sexual feelings. Being brought up by a parent, of course from this generation there is a shame associated with nationality. This provides for some predictable but well-done conflict. Perhaps the most fun was the way in which the main character grew slightly in his romantic relationship and realized a deeper depth of sexual feelings. A good hour but nothing stirred ....
