Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It is so addictive that you can play it for hours and hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game 4 times, but I did not get all the 120 stars ... (I've got 111) ... but I hope I will achieve it eventually. Although I did not play this game officially until I was 7, I loved watching my sisters play it. I'm now 13 years old and I'm still playing this, erasing the games and starting over again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are not reasonable for the early N64 game. Playing is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are difficult, but not impossible. Bowser fights a challenge. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why not just get it for yourself? Put X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii away and go to find the Nintendo 64 and play this wonderful and amazing game.
