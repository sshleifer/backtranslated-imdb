What a fun filled, sexy movie! They certainly do not make like this anymore. 4 exciting pairs of au reach to London and have all kinds of sex adventures. The tone is strangely innocent, as the great nudity of comical positions in stock develops, rather than overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. Only when the actresses lose their clothes by mistake do male characters become rampant. Richard or Sullivan literally gets a "Randy" (so). Surely the film betrays the assets of eroticism such as lying in puppets and naturism films of the old school. My interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am very fond of Gabriel Drake. If any actress looks better than ever (she's skinny but great zigzag), or worn, come to that (I loved her from the start of the UFO - who can carry a purple wig!) My hat.
