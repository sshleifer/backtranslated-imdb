This is one of three movies in the 80s I can think of that was unfortunately ignored at that time and unfortunately, still neglected. One of the others was the Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a film that looks horribly because of legal / sexual problems. Another would be Cameron Clauset which astounds me as somewhat underestimated - not great, but not nearly as bad as the reviews I've seen. Well worth your Time House Paper and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will last your mind for much longer than you might imagine. I mean, after 10 years of seeing him I still pause him, while something I've probably seen 6 months ago has entered the ether.
