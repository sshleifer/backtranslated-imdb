Sublimation is the way we should get to The Beauty. Sublimation is the stuff that makes up this film. If not his best, he is the most beloved film in Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece, like most other movies from the director, reminds us of what (or should be) about: love, loss (or failure), hope, faith, and sincerity. Since the song from which the films were taken is known as "Gershin", the film makes the impossible real, and tries to make us realize that no one is capable of judging anyone; all this with the lighting of comedy and the timing of a witty direction (the first ten minutes, with Investigators follow the ladies, almost without the line of dialogue, based on the appearance of the views of the characters - with that "touching Bogdanovich" depends on the view - is a semester on the language of cinema, something PB learned well from the talented directors of the Golden Age of films). With wonderful acting and great soundtrack (including the best of "Sinatra"), this self-conscious and compassionate film, far from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics have written), deserves a better place in the history of American cinema than the place where Put in it. It is not "long in elegance, short in substance": it is complex in its simplicity, beautiful, and very beautiful.
