This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever produced. It's a real treat for anyone. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and put you in a state of suspense. <br /> <br /> Essentially, what is going on around Homeward is three domestic pets being sent to live on a farm while the owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on, and they want to go home, fleeing the farm and trying to find their way home through the wild. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films he made without Ameche's heroine. The voice of Shadow, the old Golden Reverberator, was wise and friendly. He also starred in the film Sally Field, offering a sassi-like voice, a cat in the Himalayas. But seriously, what this movie is about is the opportunity! Changed by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor all the time), Chance is basically everything you expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic, clumsy, and every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance. It's like never ending comedy! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the time when they were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that always puts me in suspense, the scene in which the trio tries to escape from the pound; I am particularly shocked by the part where Sean encounters his collar in the fence and almost does not hit him. The film had other suspicious moments, but nothing seemed more interesting to me than that moment. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the other part. I give this movie 9 out of 10 solid!
