I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Timecula Film Festival, and I was just as impressed as I was. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the lives of a group of people who are accompanied by an adult swimming class for various reasons. It is a comical idea in itself, as the classroom is an incentive for greater changes in student life. <br /> <br /> What struck me in the film was how real it felt. Characters are rarely handled well. I enjoyed a lot of scenes in the classroom, and the drama that took place outside was very moving. There was nothing out of place or out of character, and in the end it left a very strong feeling, like going to school or summer camp - where you find quick friends, make strong connections, and discover discoveries about yourself, but you have to leave soon. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know more about her than what was finally revealed. I suppose you can not meet everyone in the class, though ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I found the movie very good and very enjoyable. See if you get the chance.
