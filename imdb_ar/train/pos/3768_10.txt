I realize that many people hate this film, but I have to admit that it is one of my favorites. I liked it better and then realized earlier and was pleased to see it better than many of the movies. <br /> <br /> First, I think people do not give the story any balance, such as "back to the future" and "time" travel is difficult to write, and in this film included travel through time and spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were there in the best performances in this film, they were cooler, they were cooler, and said things were cooler. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is also wonderful, the sets are very detailed and sometimes huge, and it can be hard to believe that these collections were made for a film about two teen buds that can not be spelled out with difficulty. .. But this is not the genius of full privilege, making these two idiots greater than the personalities of life responsible for the future of the entire utopian earth. <br /> <br /> The Osem fashion design was as well. Bill and Ted seem to be great at Bogus Journey, where they look alike in excellent adventures as they seem, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is fantastic, especially the result. There is so much I can say about this film, because I love it. But this is one of the films I grew up in. I watch it every time I like it more, so I can understand why people only hate or think about it compared to the excellent adventure (which I also like by the way). <br /> <br /> Get down with yourself bad!
