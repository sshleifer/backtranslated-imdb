This person will get reviews throughout the map because it does not fit any template comfortably. It's a horror - but not a splatterfest. It's an equally thrilling part as well as horror - yet without the usual Hollywood scream and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The movie's feel is rich and slender with no special effects because I think you should listen and watch characters' faces. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy Universe. This is a red herring. He's acting here. "Camp" is a misreading of the tone of this story. Adrian Barbou offers rocky performance - so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know the sorry excuses where the actors no longer care so clearly and wait for the director to come out and get their checks. This is not the case, here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that objects begin to fall regularly and are almost funny. I do not think the intention was funny - but to keep you out of balance. <br /> <br /> Think of it less than "Horror" and more than "Horror" playing on stage - that worn-out White House. Then you might see that it really is about paranoia, fear, and rising insanity in an isolated place in the United States. <br /> <br /> It is coiled. Travel through time, mind control, secret experiences and Nazi that may not be dead. . .However. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and try it if you are in the mood for something small cerebral. This would be a good choice to spend the Saturday at midnight.
