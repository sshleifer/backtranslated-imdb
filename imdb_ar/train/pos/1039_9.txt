I have watched this movie several times and watched it today (on TCM) just because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is an actress who has been very scorned and I have to admit that I have been crushed for her since I first saw her (perhaps in Wuthering Heights 40 years ago or more). But the real star in this film is Paul Lucas, and deserved all the awards he got. It shows, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped, and nothing helped that well. He gave his children a line about being bad and they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when talking to adults, he would do this thing again without hesitation. Lucas gave an excellent picture of a man who had fallen into this position and explained that what he did was very difficult to do. <br /> <br /> Some believe his victim was a Nazi, but I do not think so - I think it was only after the money. His fellow Nazis knew that and that's why they did not take much advantage of him. <br /> <br /> Among the interesting points in the film, it is also assumed in the play, the fact that Muller (Lucas) is German. While Germany's anti-German hysteria was not repeated in World War I in the Second World War, there was a strong anti-German feeling. Some Germans were similar to those in California with people of Japanese origin. It was brave for Helman to write a play about good Germans at this time (perhaps she thought they had signed the Nazi Nazi treaty!). After all, the US and British air forces bombed German cities and had no concern about the killing of innocent civilians. However, I think that the Dresden bombing and the firestorm had happened later, after the issuance of "Witness on the Rhine". <br /> <br /> The title is a game of play on words, as the "watch" is heading west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a march song for the German army - used in World War II, but the Nazis had their own march song also used. But Muller is German and participates in his "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was there were lots of kids like him. I am surprised that he did not give his father a secret. In real life, he may have done so.
