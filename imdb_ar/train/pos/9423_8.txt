I can not say whether the British comedy films after World War II produced in Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I am completely addicted, and a man in a white suit is one of the best. There is no need to get into the well-known plot about the threat posed by the textile industry and textile unions by indestructible fibers and resistance to dirt. Suffice it to say that the cranes and arrows that Sidney Stratton has endured naively in pursuing his polymeric vision make comedy delight. Many famous faces from the world of British actors - nervous Cecil Parker, skillful Michael Goff, and ruthless Ernest Theissinger - made great performances. Guinness - as it is always and forever - is wonderful, and Jane Greenwood is as delicious as Daphne (just as the word "Daddy" declares, making the entire film worth watching). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!!" !!!!
