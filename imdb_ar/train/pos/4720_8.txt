A beautiful movie, especially if you love horses, World War II films and the story of the burning Hungarian plateau. It is a story of courage, compassion and generosity. Equestrian Equestrian as well as horse main characters in his own training. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and see it again. This is a family film and I highly recommend it. Good movie "Family Nite". Although there were some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The indigenous people were very impressed with the way they stood, even in the face of the certain death of a Nazi officer who had his own reasons for pursuing Brady. Very nice movie.
