What surprised me most about this film was the large audience that attracted it. Similar movies like Anita and Me did not cause the uproar caused by this film, although I think this may be due to the mention of "Beckham" in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that displays a great message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind in front of it, a positive message for anyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the best Knightley Keira movies, and I think they are a fantastic actress and were excellent for this role. Parminder Nagra was very brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say this to Jonathan Reese Myers, because I do not think he was a lot of good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, a wonderful movie, and a wonderful story
