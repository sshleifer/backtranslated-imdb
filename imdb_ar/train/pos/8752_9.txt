I've been waiting for such an original picture like this for some time now. Brokedown Palace has this "hard-to-believe" side, but with innovative guidance and a scenario, Palace has achieved a great degree. <br /> <br /> I never enjoyed seeing Claire Danis in any of her films, but I'll tell you, I really changed my mind with this film. Kate Beckinsell joins the Danes on vacation to Thailand where they meet with a young man who persuades them to make a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he neglected to tell them that they would carry an obscene amount of drugs for him. Well, eventually they are caught, and end up in jail in Thailand. I know, how do I know, that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can overcome this little wrong mistake, you'll find a well-written and written story. I recently found myself drawn from the stories of the films I watch, and I develop a personal feeling of the characters I see. This film is no different. By the end of the film, I found myself more interested in her than any other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman offers excellent performance and connects the film together beautifully. <br /> <br /> There are some twists and turns that will make you cry at the end of the movie. This is one of those movies you probably went through when you search for this movie to watch it at home. In my opinion that next time in the video store, do not pass this again.
