So, because I'm very impressed with horror movies, it's been some time since I saw a movie that made me jump (or nervously nervous.) <br /> <br /> I'll definitely get this on DVD when it comes out ... hell better Much of the ring. The thing I do not get is that many of the people we talked to after the film thought it was terrible, well, if that's what you think, let it be ... I know what I like and it takes quite a bit to make me really scared, so I must say that This is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now, you may be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and neat line, because the plot goes back a little to help build the story (I think if it is displayed in chronological order, it will destroy the whole thing). <br /> <br /> I'm really glad there was a little bloody chaos in this movie ... maybe you realize the rest of your studio book and what you're going to do you do not have to spray red things everywhere to scare people.
