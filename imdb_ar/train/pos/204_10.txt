First, I do not like almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something unique about this, it attracts me, and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedy I have ever seen. The second time you saw, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm afraid they'll be prosecuted, so they're turned into men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, and the stars show Biz is more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and you'll find that my grandmother, who still lives at the age of 97 years (and lived until the impersonation of her wonderful Walter Matthau!) Will deny it - but some of you should find an echo in these characters. Second, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he made one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and even enjoyed by my late grandmother, although she failed to recognize the wonderful similarities she shared with the character of the film ). Very ethnic in flavor, on top, you will laugh and laugh or close this. For me, I'm still happy.
