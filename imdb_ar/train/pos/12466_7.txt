If Jean Renoir's first film, "Wirlpool of Fit" takes us first to the countryside, rivers, and peasant life that will continue to be explored, it seems appropriate that his second film deals with the bulk of the film with the rich and distinct, the upper classes and those trying to claw their way to the above. Put the characters of the first two films together, and you have the seeds of "big illusion" and "rules of the game." Beautifully photographed, with a turbulent camera that takes full advantage of the stunningly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the film. Representation despite frequent droughts also offers some of the best moments, especially from Muffat Werner. But the charming Mrs. Hessling, who at first seemed to give Louise Brooks a chance to make a living, would never go beyond one observation, a selfish, selfish prostitute. Perhaps this is in part a problem in the script, which seems to be mostly used to get high points and angry emotions; not to read the novel, I'm not really clear on whether the options are well-made or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between the kidnappers with Nana are well designed, and I particularly liked the relationship between Moffat and Jean Angelo VanDevers - tragic concepts that seem to have their ultimate fate and empathy with each other, especially in the scene down The massive staircase where Vandifers warns Muffat, and we wonder if the violence will break out - this and other silly idiots help to give the film the depth it enjoys. <br /> <br /> Away from his greatest achievements, perhaps for me just shy in general about the "spiral of destiny", this is still worth seeing for fans of Renoir or those interested in silent cinema in general.
