I've seen FIDO on some movie channels and I have to say I became an instant fan. The film looks like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the Surrealist 1950s, as you know the health contract when they danced to Elvis while throwing nuclear bombs in the desert just because they were watching. People were so na√Øve at that time that it was scary and the idea that these clean people would find it normal to have a zombie while the pets were already working here. <br /> <br /> Glory to this Canadian production and fragile cinematic photography are excellent actors, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Chernie and the child. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this film was not the biggest success. It deserves more recognition. It's much better than Tim Burton or SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Oh, okay. It's an instant classic game.
