I really enjoyed the details that entered the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (spelling error) and Joel were outstanding in supporting roles. It was also Jeffrey Wright. Toby McGuire gave a wonderful job as he was ever portrayed, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing he would die without action. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to detail, by training in good dialect to catch an incredibly Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood promoters swept this film under the rug by Hollywood promoters whom I can only imagine. I have strong doubts. Making it more attractive to me. I have provided more than ten copies of DVDs for gifts. <br /> <br /> The movie has been completely ignored. You can rent them or buy them and give you full attention for a few hours, then judgment.
