This film is a real and historical film. It is very useful for those who search the LDS church, because it is 100% real. It's an excellent film and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's very realistic, exciting and stimulating. Some believe it is not realistic, but it is. <br /> <br /> It concerns the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Joseph Smith philosopher who restored it. He has such events in his life as the illness he suffered when he was a small child, and puzzled Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, childbirth, and so on. But more importantly they reveal the restoration of the church.
