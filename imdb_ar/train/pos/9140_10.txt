I like this film!!! Purple rain came out the year I was born and it was my heart since I remember. The prince is very tight in this film. I went to a special show for Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert I was happy to see some real fans because this film is less than its real value, it is really one of the greatest movies of all time. Music can not be compromised. The film revolves around the film "The Kid," played by the prince, and his family is dysfunctional. His band is the most exciting event in the city, watching Apollonia, an ambitious singer. No doubt that the purple color is my favorite color, thank the "baby" on it. So if you do not see this, you need to arrive as quickly as possible. This is classic - 4ever!
