Not every film motivates you superficially. I will face an ambitious failure in a big market any day. While this can not be described as failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. That quality that can not be solved I would like to see again and again. This is a film full of challenges, and does not provoke things exactly. Problem with the film in its structure. It seems that its impenetrable plot is over, just as the second end is dealt with. Although everything is technically dazzling, the film is very long in this unit. Liu's long-delayed delay comes almost 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Great cinemas often come at the expense of a decent script, but the innovative camera technology provides a wide range of visual ideas here. Installation of a provocative and attractive piece of art. The figure is dropped at the back but his hand in the foreground is not. The world was filmed deliberately and left and ridiculous. Keep your eyes peeled for an unforgettable and amazingly technical assassination that will make your jaw fall. <br /> <br /> The works are amazing. Anyone who chooses to release a video (not printed) in the format of the scale and scan should never see it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible how anyone can give this original review a bad review. You should see it at least once. You feel that von Trier is failing more than he can chew, but this film ends up being richer for him. I think he is aware of Hitchcock's foreign correspondence, where committed Europeans are also manipulating American deception and many Wales films that enjoy the delicious delight as much as he does. All von Trier films explore the plight of naivety amid unforgiving societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from this kind of daring artistic experimentation towards the dreary, unsorted and inaccurate sap, such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
