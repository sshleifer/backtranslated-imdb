Here's my first film, David Mamet. Fitting, because it was his first, as well. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and moves like any movie cones, from small negatives to big negatives to universal subscriptions. It's like "The Grifters", but without the level of representation of this film. (In this film, John Kusak was pleasant but his nature was character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wonder whether it is supposed to be gentle that Crosse acts as an attack of some sort on psychoanalysis). At least initially. It does not become good at all, but it develops beyond the painful line after about ten minutes. In the early part of the film, some of Lindsay Krauss' lines - in the way you read them - seem to be an internal argument or a novel, and they are not. With Mantegna things picking up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as enjoyable as it should be. I was expecting buzzing percussion percussion lines that roll from the tongue, but these lines do not. All this seems very readable, rather than spoken. Mamit may have evolved after this film and is reduced, but if that does not happen, perhaps others should be allowed to direct his words. It is very precious with them here, and as a result, they lose their rhythmic quality. More surprisingly, however, the film does not look or look like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it was very similar to the cinematic theater, but in this film the actors were not only done, but relaxed and free. Everything was flowing. <br /> <br /> I do not mind if it looks like movie characters talking about movie lines - or even playing characters talking about lines of action - but here it seems like the characters of a movie (or even a book) playing lines are talking. It's a strange mix of theater and movies that not only work. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often very entertaining. Best piece in the middle. <br /> <br /> They are ordinary purposes in the film: the new man (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Cross) gets involved in the deceptive criminal world. How to participate: She is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a mandatory gamble. She wants to help him with the gambling debt, so enter the House of Games, a small game room where scammers work in a back room. I will admit that the setup is highly unlikely. (Did they just expect Crouse to come in? Did they expect her to write a check? Was Billy in it? Certainly one of these questions was answered by the end.) <br /> <br /> Here are the negatives to start with. I found that beginners - young learners - are the most fun. We've got a lesson in the art of tricks as much as Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see the end coming, then we have not seen the second end coming, then the real ending that I have not seen coming, but probably done. The ball continues to bounce back and forth By the last scene in the film, we realize that Crouse II entered the House of Games and found her real call. <br /> <br /> I will forgive the opening spam, the impossible bits and the strange font reading because there are so many goodies here. If the first part of the film seems complicated, stick to it. After half an hour, the momentum is already gaining momentum. If you want to film a fun con, then here are. If you want Mamet, go see "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br /> ***
