As a great admirer of imagination in general, and of the works of Jiman * in particular, I was looking forward to this film with great passion, with great hunger and a sweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment. We rarely think it is finally here. And learn what? You do not need to fear, the film version is great **. Different from the book, but in a good way - less strange in elegance, more comic, and still sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> Special effects are perfectly localized and make magic feel a natural and appropriate part of the world of the wall without being astonishingly amazing. <br /> <br /> Proper attention has been paid to the storytelling and its speed, and the main choice has become a triumph, with the princes (who have read their names in almost naked names as one of the "Who is" of the currently brilliant British comedy - Robert Everett, David Williams of Little Britain's fame, two blokes from Green Wing, etc.) steal most of the best lines and coolest movie moments that are largely abundant. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only simple criticism I have in the whole film is that sometimes the elements of comedy become a little OTT, and the precision moves from the window to criticism of the main story .... The veil of Ricky Gervais , For example, was more than just "Ricky Gervais doing the usual work of David Brent of the Office Comedy characters" for the Trojans, and in my opinion, created an unwanted break and a shake of the magic spell of the progressive story (despite fairness, memory, I think Ferdy's character in the original book was pretty "Ricky Gervais" - I wonder when I go back to her) .... <br /> <br /> A fictional fantasy novel Written correctly with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist of Tristan, captures the right mix of naive and hidden comedy and self-awareness required for such a story, where "a humble little boy starts to seek life change"; Claire Dance in the beautiful Yvaine film, a little quirky and ethereal, Robert De Niro, who has been talked about by all reviewers in this edition, deserves praise and enjoys good entertainment (he seems to have a ball too) ... and Michelle Viver is as brilliant and bright as the evil witch of Lamia, the overall performance of the film . If you've enjoyed her good performance in the modern Hair Stylist, you'll enjoy it well. <br /> <br /> So, to close this review: You will laugh, certainly, you will smile, and maybe cry - Stardust is a beautiful fairy tale that inspires warmth for the whole family, with a heart of gold and a more intelligent SAS than apparent immediately. One of my favorite films is the wonderful Bride Princess, and Stardust is easily likened to this for good reason because it is a very similar type of film that explores similar themes and territories. Just like the Princess Pride is still refreshing, intelligent and funny twenty years after its initial release , I think Stardust's delicious sweetness will appear as a favorite of the family on our TVs (or equivalent receiver!) For many years to come.
