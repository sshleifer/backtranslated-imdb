World Hunters Dragon is a 3D gravity world hard. Floating planets, cutting buildings and exotic flat plants in the air, while the earth towards most of the characters do not fall. It is a world similar to the story of Neverending, when Nothing came to eat the world away. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the villain here is World Gobbler, too. This time it is a huge skeleton with a fiery eye. The heroes are a great warriors after the implication, and an annoying and greedy companion who runs the leading side of the duo and useless alien animals. I have joined them the most talkative little girl in the world who has not died, so sad, for a terrible painful death and hope early on. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Sounds and sounds are first class. The story is very bad and simple as one can imagine. They go to stop the evil world, reach him almost immediately, and defeat him. End. No real personal development or story development. Not even those I expect from a film like this plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's nice to watch, and kids are likely to enjoy it, but that's about it. No depth to this world (pun intended).
