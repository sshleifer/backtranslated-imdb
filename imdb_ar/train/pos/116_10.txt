Man man man ... I've been foolishly procrastinating (not on the right run, there is a long list!) To watch this film and finally I had the opportunity to do so. And "news" is: a wonderful scenery a maze! <br /> <br /> For any "follower" of the iPhone Trier: Both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc ... Europa is perhaps the differential of its magnificence visually. Everything is pretty depressing and fearful! You really feel within this "imaginary" time warp of nightmares. The film leads from surrealist masters such as Bonwell, Bergman, and even the 1940s films containing acidic drops from avant-garde Von Trier, the cinematographer as the "totalitarian" filmmaker of the time. His authoritarian approach to dealing with very complex, yet irrational, issues strikes the nerves of the viewer with the aim of treating some of the deepest wounds we eat in our hypocrisy world. <br /> <br /> As a utopia as it seems, I think that people like Von Trier can help society in several ways on a larger side. Films and filmmakers with this kind of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, and perhaps the beginning of a new era: "the age of emotional control over our fears." This is what he constantly offers us through his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
