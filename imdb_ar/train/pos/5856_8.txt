E rated (contains violence). <br /> <br /> I got the original Spider-Man game for the computer for a few years now. I have not been able to overcome it because Windows XP has one level defect and I can not win because of that. So you should be warned if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try this game. It is a clean, fun and exciting family game for any Spiderman fan. In the game played by Spiderman and face many criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any spiderman fan or parent who wants a fun and clean game for their kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
