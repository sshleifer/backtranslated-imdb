Just once in a while, we get a R-rated comedy that is of interest to everyone. It is a rare situation when critics admire it. I just came back from the 40 year old virgin and I can honestly say, it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I went to a 10:35 show and filled every row. Not only that, everyone laughed at the ass all the time. It's two hours of non-stop laughter. I challenge you to see this movie and not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A forty-year-old man is a virgin. However, behind this simple joke, the second five, we got a deep and complex story that is not only one of the funniest ever, but we have real lessons behind it. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, the 40-year-old Virgin. Steve Carell, in my opinion, was known as one of the best thieves of all time. Steve Carell stole the exhilarating scenes from Bruce the Almighty, especially the Anchroman. He has come a long way, as he finally and proudly received, to see him shine as a star. No one will forget his name as soon as he sees this funny, widely circulated and compassionate comedy on the podium. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is that it is not 100% stupid. The wonderful writing of Good Apatow and Steve Karel has a real purpose, not just one hell of a story to tell. Behind the rude and vulgar ride of the film, there is an important lesson to learn. Although not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us more than a good time. The attitude that breaks the intestine will make you laugh all the time, while at the same time seeing the real life struggles of people like Andy and his co-workers. The end can not be better. It not only offers what we promised but gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers ever seen by comedy. It was great to have Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in there somehow, but you can not win everything, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think as Roger Ebert put it, Katharine Kenner performed an unthinkable performance like Tric, the only woman Andy really has. It's not only blowing us, but it's crazy to see how the story feeds brilliantly. She has been perfect in this role, and she and Carl have wonderful chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The Canadian assessments are wise, again, with Ontario sliding 14A, while British Columbia Alberta and Manitoba all applauded the 40-year-old virgin with 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, is the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for it. To all your fellow teenagers in the United States: Good luck sneaking! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Karel offers one of the most exciting shows I have ever seen, and everyone in the acting team is divided into a non-stop laugh. Everyone will love the 40-year-old virgin this summer, and I encourage everyone to see her as soon as humanly possible. This is the best comedy of the year, down. She excels everywhere on The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers, and of course the unforgettable Apatow and Carell comedy, Anchorman. <br /> <br /> It's a comic masterpiece and deserves a lot of praise from the critics I admired. I have loved every one of my favorite critics and it deserves a place on IMDb Top 250 right away. Steve Carell is a huge star. Watch one of the brightest summers now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Self? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliasson A.
