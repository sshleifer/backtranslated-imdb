Of course, by any standard critique of films, the soldier is a very bad film already. Kurt Russell is a supernatural future soldier who has been raised since birth to kill him but then becomes obsolete after being improved by a handful of superlative soldiers really in a humming barn that is somewhat similar to the Gladators contest without mats. <br /> <br /> After being abandoned on an unwanted planet, he became friends with a group of hippies in space that teaches him about horticulture, family life and breast. Kurt does not talk much. Finally, super soldiers come and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back as they flee. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. The total planet gets. End. <br /> <br /> Unless the academy starts a new category for "the best explosion," Soldier will not win any awards. However, as far as it is ridiculous, it is still a pleasant experience. Military devices are the finest since foreigners (especially APC), and in 90 minutes, do not outweigh their welcome. Please note that the tag below is only a guide. Get rid of five points if you plan to take them seriously and deduct one more point if you do not like small games. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
