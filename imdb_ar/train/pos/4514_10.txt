I recently watched this movie, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine and we have so much fun! This film is a masterpiece of garbage. Try watching it with this purpose! This was not expected, of course, but the performances performed by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is the best), the weak text and the low-cost budget have created a great mix of idiotic things. Tomba just retired from the Alpine ski race, where he was the dominant artistic skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic golds, two world championships and nine World Cup titles. Seriously about the director: No one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All other Damiani directives are great.
