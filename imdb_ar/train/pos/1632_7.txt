The best in a military school? Hmmmmm, looks funny, maybe offensive to some. You have characters there, the Arab thief, the crazy sexual adolescent, the smart mouth, the smoker, and never forget, the man who burns things. Throw in the film Sergent Strict and Stupid, a gay Sergent and a sexy ammo teacher and one makes a crazy movie adventure one. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie and it's funny, because comedy is about the truth if you try to work together, you'll do it. <br /> <br /> This group of unsuitable students was placed at the Weinberg Military School here because, as Sergeant Lejman quotes, "because you are outcasts, an embarrassment to your families, communities, and shame." One of Ralph Macchio's previous performances in front of Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances from Barbara Bach, also appeals to teenagers and young people. <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack keeps the movie moving.
