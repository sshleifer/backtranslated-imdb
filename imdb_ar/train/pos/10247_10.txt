This film is banned in every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese (?) Who represent the star in this must be really desperate for a job, or we are just friends. Here are the shovels: <br /> <br /> Three thugs are torturing hell from a helpless woman, using all kinds of things to kill her in the end, burn her, rock her and run her here on a chair (more than 200 times!), Use verbal torture A way of forcing her to listen to a steady voice for more than 20 hours! This does not look bad at all, but it can make you run out). They throw out the courage (maybe from an animal) while Chase comes out, and she cries when she wakes up. And for those who can forget the finale grand torture GREATEST EYEBALL I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard about these movies, and watched them without realizing that it's a fake movie, you'll think it is! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) This content is to scare people and sick some of them! As I said pure underground. Check it out if you are an underground horror fan, or a foreign gore. If you do not have a strongly recommend follow up the series before watching! From the downside, shock, and creativity, you get 10, but through the story and all these things, it's a classic underground game ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 </ ... <br />
