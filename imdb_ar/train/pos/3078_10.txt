I loved this show ... Intelligent representation, intelligent dialogue, wonderful story with real people .... Please return it or make it available online ... I really miss it. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... it really makes sense in this crazy world. Get rid of these stupid realism offers and give this offer a second chance, please return it is not for a break .. but please! When I came out of the air, I watched online and loved how I could watch it with the least amount of interruptions. In fact, ABC online makes it easy to enjoy the shows when you miss the peak times ... Gone are the days of Infinite Registration. Anytime you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
