It is necessary to produce a film about Gandhi in India, which does not appear as a man can not make a mistake. This film shows how Mahatma failed to be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are fantastic, the cinema is fantastic, the direction is awesome, but the movie lasts. If the intention is to make this film without any box office expectations, which I suppose is the case here, then it is a wonderful attempt, but if business makers expect it to be commercially successful, the fate of the film was fateful on the day they chose this Subject. <br /> <br /> After 20 years from now, this film will be remembered for the beautiful Harilal portrayal of Akshay Khana. He deserves Oscar nomination for this candidacy. Honestly, not the only praiseworthy performance, Shivali Shahaya is so wonderful .. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears of his father's death. No dialogues, no screaming, but a violent shot by Khana. It's one of the coolest scenes filmed in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father is not at all an exciting cinema but yes, it's an excellent cinema and you have to watch it. Great try ..
