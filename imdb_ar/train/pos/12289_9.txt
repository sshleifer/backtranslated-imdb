Above all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so there was no chance to be disappointed in this aspect. The main drawback I have seen is the historical details, with many cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think he did not belong at the time. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The artistic side of the movie is fine, nothing calls to brag. But acting, I think, was wonderful. I do not have any experience in acting, yet I can not believe how people consider this terrible! Maybe they only watched two films (ever), and the other one must be very good already! <br /> <br /> I particularly liked Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his character, a person who crawled to the social ladder by working very hard, then fighting against those who would take his life from him, but he only participated in this battle, he did not realize that The reason is no longer on his side, and ends up being a frustrated, frustrated man. Iron made this reasonable, sympathetic to the character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as romantic girls, attracted by her romantic friend Banderas, who had an unorthodox part, I think). Glenn Close was also good. The average performance of Meryl Streep, was not bad, not only according to other actors' standards. Watch out for Miguel Guillerm, the wonderful Portuguese actor, among many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's movies, here are just explanations, only people are important, but at the same time, it is not just the claim of the film, very concerned about trying to be intellectual. The best proof that I really liked it, I write a review after 7 years.
