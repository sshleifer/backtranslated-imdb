I found this movie by accident, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh came close to stealing the film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry made them a more enjoyable film. This film brought to mind the excellent films made by Branagh with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turns here when she was a struggling young woman trying to complete herself and she was performing as well as I had seen in a longtime female leader. It is difficult to draw a picture of a disabled person, but with only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, it made sense. If this film came out after the current wave of films with beautiful women "stabbing" their roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I was sure that Carter would have been seen at the Oscars. If you run this movie over the cable late at night as you did, trust me, it's worth missing sleep.
