A young girl survives as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap crook wants to score a great deal. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand and may think of opening titles as a violent film but also a love story with two people in their struggle to get the money for a better life. This film seems like an article at times because of its changes in images, but it is still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke but it's well told," says a character. This also applies to this: We've seen the story but that's how we see it. Thailand appears in hot colors, moving the image from one color to a multicolored place. It embodies the city as a cage for these imperfect people. There is also good use of music to determine actions.
