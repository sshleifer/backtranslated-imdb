They had me from the premiere. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one simple difference. Sheriff is really the devil. There is a spoiler. It's not as if you will not discover it in 10 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it well, but it's a tough battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and loves spending time with him to teach him the ways of darkness. Fluent. sneaky. It does not always come as a mug. Most of the time is a champion. Everyone owes him a great advantage, because he often hits a disaster and saves it. So every time you think someone will finally let him down, no one comes out of his friends from anywhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in a room and some men decided with guns to steal them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) was reluctant to shoot them. Lucas Caleb told that Ted had half a conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them now. If he has a real conscience, he will never become a criminal. So he began calling him half Ted. It was very funny. He was making fun of criminals. Of course 10 steps left by half TED at all times. Of course he was in full control at all times. They have already preferred Satan. Very excellent presentation too. It was one of my favorite horror programs of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's a good company.
