The amazing combination of love and psychology for two young people. They were represented in the most wonderful way and certainly touched your heart. A rare combination where the complement to the foreground precedes storytelling and emotion intensity. The film emphasizes your faith in love and the pain of separation. The joy of seeing your lover is the most unparalleled and you can sacrifice anything. Ethan and Jolie crafted eternal characters in such a simple way that the film gives great pleasure and love to watch. We must see the film for all people who believe in true love. By far the most romantic film (at least one of them) at all times.
