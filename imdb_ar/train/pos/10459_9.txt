I did not expect to be so impressed by this film that portrays a family just as you would expect it to live in the neighborhood. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not like typical Hollywood fare. They face a very common problem - debilitating disease. But the story line captures the heart with a powerful lesson. The flow, writing, direction, and representation flow with the increase that attracts the viewer deep into the story. Give this film your full attention and inspire its message.
