Beautifully crafted by Gretchen Moll, it captures stainless happiness in its work, recreates small films and photographs beautifully and is often a joy. According to Haroun, they used a film that is no longer a product and the 1950s-style studio lighting, even for external sites to give the color parts its distinctive appearance. Betty Begg saw the movie in the house of Hugh Hefner (now 83) with the producers there, but not the director, if she was embarrassed if she did not like it. Apparently she did so until the official investigation, which I found disturbing. Some costumes are very big. The idea of ​​the film started in 1993, but this was worth the wait. Her image does not appear to be false in reference to all those horrible images and film parts that many of us have already seen. Would make an interesting companion piece with Goodnight and Goodluck, but watch more fun!
