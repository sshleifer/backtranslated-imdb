People claim it has been modified in a funny way but have been forced to cut it dramatically in the post-production phase. I have Harry as a professor at the American University right now, frankly, it's one of my best classes. The funny thing here is that what happened in making Harry's movie was a reason for animation. I originally watched "The Joy of Life" for another group where Harry made a voice in the film, and began watching this film after the class began. Harr originally did some performance, and it's really true to create your moments, especially when you have to re-edit things until you reach that moment, but that's something you see in this film.
