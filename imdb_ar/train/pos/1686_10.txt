After a long hard week behind the office making all those bad decisions, this is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this movie will take you to the land of alien humor and science fiction play. Captain Zibo died in a big charge from Buick. He was a brave man. Jack Nicholson is impressed by this strange face with dark sunglasses and a leather jacket. Always remember the caution of "cake of death!" Consider the first rule of this film - Suspension of Kufr - Sit and relax - and "Get ready to die Earth Scum!" You should see it yourself.
