I never had ink while watching the movie that it was reserved for the stupid fund. I always thought this film was very successful in the late 1990s. But after I saw on the internet that this was dedicated to the TV, I was shocked because the TV movie, was absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> The thing that mostly interested me was the length. I felt that the person in the battle scene must be removed because it is absolutely unnecessary. Also, I started turning towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, interesting and attractive plot with fantastic offers by everyone. I just felt that Patrick Fries looked a little barren. I also felt that Gogool, who looked dementia, was a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful landscape in Africa. Also, the first half of the film was going to make me give this movie 9 movies. However, it is a wonderful movie for television. 8 of 10.
