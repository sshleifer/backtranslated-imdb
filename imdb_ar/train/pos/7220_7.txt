There is nothing more fun for me than the story of the World Health Organization or the thrill story that keeps you posted on how it all ends. That's exactly what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on the chilling play of Ira Levine ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> Michael Caen and Christopher Reeve have to do the kind of trick that Caen and Laurence Olivier did at SLEUTH - with great skill and a great deal of mystery as ever in that extraordinary smart play . <br /> <br /> But because it is designed to scare you and surprise you and keep you informed of the guesswork for the result, it is difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the film at the moment. MICHAEL CAINE is a madly jealous playwright whose last play failed miserably. When the ambitious young writer Christopher Reeve sends him to the manuscript of his play, Ken realizes that getting rid of him because his problems will solve all his problems and restore his reputation. <br /> <br /> An interesting issue and games for the public as the story of Ira Levin travels, and Agatha Christie was overcome with a number of twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Both Caine and Reeve play each other brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to a story, as well as some comical touches that come from a script that gives the drama a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Summary: Worth watching - but not everyone is happy at the end.
