The problem many people face in this film is that they seem to think the story should have been more entertaining (ignore it based on a real story) or flatter against a movie that glorifies Che (which is really not). This film is very close to the final biography of John Anderson on Che and gets the story correctly. Soderburgh does an excellent job of preparing the mood of the collapse that was Che's adventure in Bolivia. You really feel the full shock of the Bolivian peasantry with Chi's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties his men have faced with hunger and terrain. Sorry to take the fan's attention to the film challenged there but that's what happened. Do not go to this movie to expect the release of Rambo, it's a true story!
