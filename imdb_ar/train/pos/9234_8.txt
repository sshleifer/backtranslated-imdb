The report, which relies on actual historical events, this epic, violent, destructive and destructive period, supports viewers' attention by creating the lost verisimilitude in the majority of films that are set in a distant age. Mrs. Polcan's depiction of the rebellious nun is a tour of the force. The gradual transformation of her personality from obedient naughty if not willing to social injustice in its day, is brilliantly illustrated by telling the sequences: I saw the activity of the local casual rapist duke, the relationship of her forbidden love with a Jew, her criminal deviation from the Muslim invader forces of Prince Ahmad Al-Hassi ( Antony Corlan) There are some painful realist sequences in this film that are not for the most sensitive, but viewers with a strong stomach and attention to the history of the Middle Ages should find great interest. Deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to Hollywood's portrayal of the medieval world.
