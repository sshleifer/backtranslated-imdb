It was a great film with good actors, all of them colliding with all the CDs. When Diane Keaton is at its best, well, the situation does not get any better. But Tom Everett Scott, he was always less appreciated, was the best. He must be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one side of the script. None of the characters ever recognized that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Her mother was not playing Keaton. At one point, I made a promise to one person not to reveal that he was asleep. <br /> <br /> Another commentator said the film had a "political agenda". This is puzzling to say. There was no policy at all in this film.
