Pinjar by Mr. dwivedi is a wonderful movie. It is certainly the best and coolest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from Mast Urmila. It's like you've never seen before. One real great performance. Together with her is a good actor Manoj Bajpayee, who showed Bollywood what is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film revolves around a girl (Ormila) living in Pakistan before partition. Is from a Punjabi family living in a small town. She was kidnapped by a Muslim man as part of an ongoing battle with Kinda with the Punjabi family. Then follows a series of twists and turns where the expected marriage of urmila is due within a few days. This film is really a very good film. The story is solid with an amazing script. All offers such as Lilete Dubey and Isha Koppikar (will not believe but they can act well alongside Jus Dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. These groups with Pakistan before division, fashion, cinema, sound, background score add to the positive points from start to finish stuck to your seat with the following question: This movie is not really worth watching but it deserves to be part of your film collection. The final scene is the end of the film. I would like to suggest all these crowds "La Caphei-Khushi-Caphi-Smag-nou-del-To-Bagel-Hai" to see this amazing click. My rating: 10/10.
