Now I was always impressed with the Full Moon puppets. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yes I heard the story working wonderfully, the atmosphere really works and the actors are doing first class work. Gary Graham, who makes his mark on television in programs such as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be an action star named Ass and take his name. Effects of motion can be slightly better. The color was wrong, they seemed to me plastic instead of the metal they were supposed to be. But this is a simple complaint compared to the whole, Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, you'll be thrilled by this movie. 9 Stars out of 10.
