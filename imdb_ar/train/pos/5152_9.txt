It is clear that "Hitler, the Rise of Evil" is produced by people who do not emotionally mobilize them from the horrors of World War 2. Making watching a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think the greatest value lies in the clear disclosure of the Nazi mechanism. Of the completely corrupt ways Hitler used to reach the top. After arriving there, the film ends. <br /> <br /> On his head, 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') led Germany to the greatest and most destructive war in human history. Ending six years after Germany's total defeat. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (about 35% of its territory before the war) and had to accept 44 years of its remaining land. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, and their reputations were severely damaged by the many racist atrocities inspired by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the Rise of Evil" makes good control. Putting in an acceptable thirties environment, with (more than) competent acting. In particular, the role of Peter O'Toole as the old president von Hindenburg stands out, but adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My version of "Hitler, The Rise of Evil" offers a second DVD disc with two good documentaries and films. The first concerns the personality of Hitler, and the second deals with the falsification of Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this forgery caused the Farhan scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of many historians and journalists.
