Wonderful! I loved this movie and loved Judy Marty !! This girl is not just a beautiful face wonderful, it's funny and really talented !! She made me laugh only a few times by being too harsh with Victor who beat her hard! We'll see it a lot in the coming years ... and maybe also from director Peter Solit and co-star Victor Rassock! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best films I have seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's real, cute, funny, well shot, I've got everything: a good story, good actors, a good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you love simple movies, slow life and real life, like the "Jersey" girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! it's better!
