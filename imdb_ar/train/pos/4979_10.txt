This is the second short film for Burlesk released, perhaps the most popular, is a parody of the silent film "What Price Glory" of 1926. <br /> <br /> I watched this and I do not understand the porn that is being claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the 1980s and 1990s, in which young girls wore more provocative clothes in a "mature" way. It was more provocative because they did not wear diapers. There is nothing provocative about diapers unless you have one of those crumbs. (Just a joke) I read this description of the film and where it states that just pedophiles will enjoy watching this. It's disgusting. For me, if you see this and get upset, you may need to look at your psychology and try to find out why you are upset. It is an innocent film made as a parody of another film. All B.B. Films It was a parody, nothing more. The parody / parody of today is of a graphic nature and has almost pornographic scenes and a completely evil language. Should not those be more appalling? I can watch without an issue, but sometimes they take the children's stories and turn them into filthy parodies. This is what you should get under your skin. Does not mean they are homeless (not a word, I know) an adult film since 1926, because we know how those silent films were, huh? Not to mention the films "Hollywood is banned from Hollywood entry", which is tacky and dirty. They will not make such a filth today? (Note the irony)
