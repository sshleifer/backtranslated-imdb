When I first saw this animation (I was 15 years old) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to the Japan animation and I kinda like it more. The full impression of the film is more sinister and darker ... colors are not ... colorful. The characters do not speak much, there are no long and boring conversations about this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, views of exotic monsters and a sense of enchantment, it looks like one of those old Scandinavian stories, full of violence and terrible creators, charming forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, skirts, oranges ... and one mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
