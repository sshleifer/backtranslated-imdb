This film deals with the Irish rebellion of the 1920s and more specifically the life of one man after he told a friend about the reward and the consequences. When watching the movie, I felt you could take the script and with some minor updates, do it again, and unfortunately it is still suitable for contemporary events. But te new edition will be almost good. The wonderful performance of Victor McLaglen (which he deservedly earned for the Oscar Awards) and an impressive array of actors includes, if not all the actors that have a prog in Hollywood at that time, mostly representatives of eminent personalities either established at that time or just starting out. Very good movie worth watching. Highly recommended.
