The only true joke that I made known as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY has been relegated to the last 20 minutes or so in the experimental landscape. The trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this magician's fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are superbly portrayed as young lovers, but ROGER LIVESEY offers the most vital and credible performance. . The French teacher MARIUS GORING is a delight (until he gets into a note about Technicolor) as the Heavenly Apostle was sent back to Neven when his death went in time of war without reporting due to censorship. Goring has some of the most intelligent lines and gives them flavor. <br /> <br /> When seeing this night on traditional Chinese medicine for the first time in twenty years or so, I think it is a shining example of what it was in the wonderful 1946 films. The depiction of Technicolor, which was rather subdued and not at all delightful, is excellent, and the way it travels to the B & W of the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the kind that really draws a spectator into the fictional aspects of the story - and the tense conversation with the radio operator Hunter while his plane crashes into the ground, unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. Truly a wonderful film from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emmeric Presberger.
