The film reaches the tension between father and father. <br /> <br /> A wonderful dialogue, beautiful scenery and great representation are an excellent way to make onions that retain the peeling layers. <br /> <br /> Key issues related to parenthood and manhood are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In a fun way, the curtain is pulled back, the masks slide slightly and reveal the facts. <br /> <br /> This happens all in the form of a wild trip coordination. The background is New York State Rural in early autumn just as trees change colors. Wonderful!
