I'm glad I was able to say almost positive things about the film with Karas and the sisters of Tassoev, Renaissance. <br /> <br /> First, it seems that it must appear; the adventure of "RENAISSANCE" is an adventure for children, a story of police investigation in search of a missing young scientist, Elona Tassoyev, Avalon's geneticist and researcher. <br /> <br /> The tale of Karas, Elona and Beslan is, although less famous than SIN CITY, is the best film, and the film most appreciated by the experts. For French comedians, it will be more important (I have influenced my French comedies last week, although I'm not so yet). The atmosphere, music, characters, lines and plot are all nice and beloved. A large Parisian policeman, Caras, is being shown to find a young woman who was a rising star of medical genetic research, Elona Tassoyev, a hot blonde temperate, whose sister-in-law was a sexually favored Bezlan, I think. <br /> <br /> For me, a Wonder Wonderland comedian, a wonderful cartoon, like the remake of WILD WILD WEST, was a legendary past that was replaced by an equally legendary future. The blas√© however, is somehow exciting. Renaissance is not suspicious; does not look particularly good? But it is seduction and hypnotism. In addition, it achieves a fee, if only briefly, for a real world, and we will think of Avalon, Nacata, Jonas Muller and the sisters of Tasuiev, Goran, Farvilla and Karas for his long childhood in the Kasbah ?? . I liked the feeling of RENAISSANCE, with some kindness, admiration and adventure, as well as a certain professional appearance. Among these new cartoons, this approach was characterized by the adaptation of Dick Linclater (the adaptation of the first Dick only) - that I am a real beauty and excitement. <br /> <br /> I thought that the future organs were appropriate, though not traditionally, to be clearly strange (such as the costumes of the invaders). <br /> <br /> As recommended, the characters have strange names, such as Bislane and Farfella, which are mostly collected from the world of arts and entertainment (Goran, Ilona) and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice that the RENAISSANCE poster looks like Rurke's image? Which does not make SIN CITY a fugitive, but not a model of originality also, in fact, there is a greater similarity with Miller's tale? The bleak future appearance of a corrupt society, the hero Borio (in fact the personal cross of Willis and the character of Rourke in the previous film ??) ?? On the other hand, this cartoon breathes more general air, and the edge is full of straight adventure, in a word, like SIN CITY for children, well, little children I mean, because there is little nudity offered. To what I said one can answer that these qualities are distinctive, even if the cliches and common places of a more futuristic caricature look of adults are true enough, and oldie Miller has brought those things on screen and RENAISSANCE carries some similarities here and there. Now it is also fair to have ring ERGORN ringgit, so for every sin city, its rebirth. I admit that I am part of these gloomy future tales, a significant specialty.
