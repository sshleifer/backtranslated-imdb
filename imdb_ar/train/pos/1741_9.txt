This is a dramatic film in the full sense of the word. The tail tells that here in Greece we live a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. It certainly has some radicalism ... but every now and then true sadness in life surpasses art. He strongly criticizes the goals we seek and the entire social structure on which we build. The film contains a deeper understanding of Greek life styles, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies with a certain fast-food audience, this film does not target anyone in particular, but as you watch it, you feel that someone is putting the best words and possible images to describe your feelings. I'm not a fan of traditional music either, but I do not want to hear anything else when it was shown during the film. <br /> <br /> If someone tells me to say something against this film, I will specify it below. Sometimes, the transition between the scenes seems surprising or partial. I think the adjustment had to be curtailed to fit two hours and a bit of theaters .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can write more and more to express my thoughts on this but I think you should see it and discuss it with a friend. Must see
