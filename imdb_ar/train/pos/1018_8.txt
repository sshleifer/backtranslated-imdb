The film was substandard, but this pioneering television offers a great starting point in what has become an ideal program for science fiction fans. Special actors and special effects (for a TV series) are presented. The presence of an interesting script also does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorites.
