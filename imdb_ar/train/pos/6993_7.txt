This is not the best film in Bela Lagosi, but it has a good old style to entertain horror for about 40 years. <br /> <br /> The brides abandon their altar like flies. I think I'll postpone the wedding to the post after the villain's capture, but it's a horror film, so I think people are ignoring the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a crazy doctor, you need a young female blood to keep his wife healthy and happy old age. He was always evading Keystone Cops by hiding corpses in the hearts (who would think of finding a corpse in the heart?), And the brides continued to get off. <br /> <br /> No movie like this can be complete without a reporter type Lewis Lane who wants to catch the offender on its own. Good at solving the crime, and bad at keeping her mouth shut at all wrong times, guessed from Lagos who chooses his next intended victim. I loved the Haunted House where I was stranded because of Louis Lane because of a thunderstorm as a guest at the villainous Lagosi Palace. Hidden paths, wife-like vampires, assistant Igor Dwarf Punk, and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> A fairly good speed keeps the movie moving, and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying way. If you love old horror movies, it's worth watching.
