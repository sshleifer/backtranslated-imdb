This was without doubt the most disturbing film I have ever seen. The first part of the film, though strange, enjoys a light and entertaining quality. The journey begins with a peaceful note, separating and confirming the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But this is misleading beyond imagination. Clear social problems (marriage of relatives) and distortions of the rural population are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby groaning from the pain, I shiver of thought. Lee Lewis made the leg. However, while the film was, in general, very disturbing and disturbing, it has raised some interesting questions. When is it moral, or the right to take someone else's life? What can ethics lead us to do or do not do in some cases? Is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever the conclusions one might draw from the film, it is an achievement in itself (although some aspects were truly shocking and wonderful).
