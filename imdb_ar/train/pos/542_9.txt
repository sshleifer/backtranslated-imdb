When I first discovered that Brian Krauss was in this movie, I wanted to watch it. It took me weeks to realize that I had seen the original version of this and loved it. So I had more reason to watch. Well, I've seen. It was actually better than most sequences of TV movies. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can tell for yourself) and I did not like most characters, including Brian's character. But the film needed characters like the nuisance and nuisance to make Stanley Caldwell (Jude Nelson) shine again. In the end, I was encouraging Stanley and his happy ending. If you've loved the original cabin on the lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I suggest you watch this.
