Lars von Terriers Europa Very good film. How so? Von Trier has a very simplified way of telling a story, at least he has with Europa. For me the entire film was an experience even if I saw it on a small television screen. Despite all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, real and exciting piece of film then most of the films in the best 250 list. I also think that it is probably the most terrifying and the most gothic and complete film. Well, there are other good things too, but this is my favorite. The last scene is one of the most horrifying scenes ever.
