I watched the show 10 years ago and loved it !!! I am now in possession of a DVD and I was watching the series, waiting for the scenes I knew at the show (when Lucas encountered Gail at his house) and realized he was missing - and suddenly I was watching the seduction without bullets over. Then I went to the internet to check all the BIOS for the stars, and I saw comments about the programs being invalid. Thank you so much!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Remember some comments that "Strangler No. 19 and Triangle 20, while the other one has the other direction." Also the Potato Boy 5, and the Met To The World 6, were reversed. Can anyone explain ?????
