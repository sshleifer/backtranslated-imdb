Some of the movies she knows she will love since the first few seconds. This is one of those films. This was followed by "Double Postage" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 1990s. Nick Keage plays the main character "down on his luck" who gets involved in the plot to kill husband and wife - and extends his luck from bad to worse to worse because he tries and tries to stay away from people, city, violence and the threat of Red Rock West. Many of the transformations, turns and great performances offered by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a lyrical musical background and hypnotic steering seamless, make this a real joy. Preferred font: When Cage looks at the empty gas scale in a car get away, shaking his head and saying: "F *** in 'the story of my life."
