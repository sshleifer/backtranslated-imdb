I was always keen to watch Hong Kong movies, but they failed to meet my expectations ... so far! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor possessed by most Hong Kong films, nor the second story line drawn into the film. The story is not complicated, but there are never existing scenes to fill some "smart" space (the only true martial arts film I've ever seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's not a real Hong Kong film). There are some amazing fighting scenes in this film, starting with the first (which is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen, but it is very short) and even the last major scenes! But keep in mind that there is a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is very good and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be achieved although some of the shots must be fairly technical (note: paper paper that he throws and hangs in the wall!). Yes, it is not Tui Hark or John Woo is making my favorite film for Hong Kong, it is Ringo Lam! I'm pretty sure that hell will check over this exit! Shred.
