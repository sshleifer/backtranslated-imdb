I recommend watching this movie with your important personality if you plan to spend a romantic evening with him. Chemistry between Johnny Wismuller and Maureen O'Sullivan has become like Tarzan and Jane so saturated with steam that it can hinder your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original movie, we began to see how Tarzan and Jane adapt to the bush and to each other. Jeanne's heavy jungle clothes and Tarzan's protest when Jane disguises her visitors shows that they are not only passionate, but also in sexual love altogether. <br /> <br /> One can complement one's touch with a painful touch and a pleasant conversation between Tarzan and Jane to portray how Tarzan's education of love is romantic, emotional and romantic. Not only does he not only convert, but he also thrives on his previously untapped sexual life. <br /> <br /> The skin in this movie appears outside the charts. In addition to the short-edged Ze Jin, which consists of two pieces of leg and legs, she also has a nude underwater swimming pool with Tarzan. (Although it is not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic swimmer Josephine McMahon is doubled in this scene) Wismarl, also reveals a huge body and perfect breasts in his corset hardly. Ladies will feel happy when Vismelmer comes out of the water after his long fight with the giant crocodile and screams at his screams - his fall covered with water falling from his hips in practice. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that over-guard Sergeant has reduced the nature of adults from Tarzan films after this entry. Although the films of Weissmuller Tarzan still thrive in the coming years, they rarely approach the appeal of this film.
