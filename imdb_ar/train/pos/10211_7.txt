Novels ?? Be it a visual or poetic epic? Generally try to avoid also have characters. After all, readers and viewers can sink very easily by trying to track who is exactly. I think this is especially true in the film, because simply we can not easily go back to modernize our memory in the cinema. But viewers like me do not face this problem because we watch all of our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, I met Audrey Tautou, the French actress, whom I first saw in the great potion of Amelie Bolan (2001) and later in a very long engagement (2004), both complex and complex stories with a large group Of characters. This previous view overrides other types in two ways: more characters and more complexity. Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999) ). This was done by Stanley Kramer with A Mad, Mad, Mad and Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is, first, the director lets us "see" inside the head of some characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated as a way to update the viewer's memory as the story flips between different time periods. <br /> <br /> Basic? The essence, so to speak? The story concerns a young woman named Irene (Tutu) who was told by one of her passengers on the train that she will meet her true love that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The smart irony at this stage is that Irene does not realize that the opposite guy (Gilbert Rubin) may be "one real love." He does not ... <br /> <br /> They go in separate ways, unaware of the potential importance of confronting them. However, the chaos is produced throughout the rest of the day, not only for young people, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of smartly structured and tangled articles that seem to be nowhere to go ... <br /> <br /> If The story was simple, it could be boring, and quite predictable. not like that. The scenario and the director mix our expectations through a range of innovative scenes that are very familiar, but turn into extraordinary events that believable and allow potential lovers to meet again. For example, the next time you drop bird feces from the sky on a book or paper for you, think about your alternatives; two people make a clear choice that must occur before Irene and her man meet again. Or what about a stone slide flying on your windshield? Looking back at what will happen ... <br /> <br /> All of this is interesting enough. What was more interesting to me was to evaluate each new man came and tried to decide whether that person was the only person for Irene, or whether he was, in fact, a young man on the train. It made me guess for a while. <br /> <br /> I will let you think about it, if you see this delicious delight. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
