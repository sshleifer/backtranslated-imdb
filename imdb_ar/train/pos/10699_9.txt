When I saw a girl's birthday, I liked it so much to see every Nicole Kidman movie, just to find them all disappointed compared to it. I think that while a certain star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of her artistic control, with Nicole Kidman, the effect she is playing hurts the enjoyment of films - IMHO. Thus, for example, Dogville, even deprives the viewer of anything visual to diminish the existential insight she has addressed to the house, or other films that promote lesbian and lesbian as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other reasons for Kidman's pets. <br /> <br /> Here is a normal woman doing a really cool job. I do not understand how or who was able to curb it, but it seems to have worked. The way the film depicts its openness despite its resistance reaches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. Thus, making the hopes of the most desperate man achievable marginally. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that males from a melksto writer turns into a muscular man in a single movie is like a male ego expansion fantasy, but turning it is sensible. Not comfortably contrived because it will be in a film designed to support the male ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth resulting from the unique film conditions. <br /> <br /> It is also fascinating how criminals are portrayed as completely human, regardless of their criminal mission. Her gang has a mixed and fragile fellowship for American culture. And while they are his enemies, they are not really his enemies. In fact, they teach him to be a competitor. <br /> <br /> I was really impressed by Kidman's ability to physically appear in Russia. It made me wonder if her ancestors were Russia, but none of her pictures showed any hint of it. Maybe it was just makeup but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they will hit her head again soon so she can make another great movie. Despite the unexplained excavations in Ms. Kidman, the message is that this film is a superior film in all ways and perhaps the role of age.
