I saw this when I was in Disney's wonderful world as a kid, so I did not remember too much of it. As I watched recently, I sat there thinking, "This is the strangest thing I have ever seen". <br /> <br /> "Travel" looks like something caused by an overdose of LSD. Animated characters are often color / sound versions of Jungle Book characters and Robin Hood. Some things you did not notice from Disney: You notice that children are threatened at the point of prostitutes and prostitutes (during the song of the Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> It was very entertaining, although the musical numbers were long and I can see little kids are bored with them. Also, the subject method was somewhat dark, as it was caught during World War II.
