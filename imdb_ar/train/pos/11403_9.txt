Jane Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musical plays with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative power in working with Arthur's unique musical unit. It's hard to believe when you watch the movie "American in Paris" that the players did not leave back at the MGM. <br /> <br /> The charm of An American In Paris is due to creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the collections designed by MGM with some background to create footage. The idea of ​​the film originated with Kelly, who simply wanted to make a film with a long string of ballet that included a poem by Georges Gershwin in Paris. It looked good to Arthur Farid, who approached Ira Gershwin who said he was fine as long as they used other Gershwin materials. <br /> <br /> Gershwin received a kind of Gershwin music that Irving Berlin usually got. No note of non-Gershwin music was heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not real music numbers. <br /> <br /> Another person who was a fair hand in writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story which is admittedly a thin story. All about the previous GI played by Jeanne Kelly who did not leave France after the Second World War, just settled in an apartment on the left bank and started to become a hungry artist. He lives with the eccentric composer Oscar Levant and does it seem like a repetition. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch and wants to sponsor him as a painter if he reciprocates in other things. But Kelly is located in a girl shop played by Leslie Caron in her first film. Caron also has the comedian George Gucci who is interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. It happens that an American in Paris is the first film I have ever seen in a movie on a flight on my first flight ever. I still remember returning from Arizona Phoenix to Kennedy Airport where I saw Jane Kelly do. However, my favorite feature in the film is Tra-La-La, in which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment where Oscar Levant plays the piano. At one point Kelly was dancing over the grand piano for the children. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Fred, I read a quote where he said in the American Ballet in Paris that it would be done with the background of the French impressionists who felt that the audience would take him instead of realistic mode in the streets or back. So it happened that way. Kelly has made long sequences of ballet in words, music, pirates, and in the city. But this one topped them all. Still doing in my opinion this includes some subsequent Jane Kelly movies. <br /> <br /> In a surprise surprise at the Oscars, American In Paris was voted the best picture of 1951, beating the movie "Street Car" of choice. I think fantasy overcame realism that year. Big budgets also have a loft in these things as well. <br /> <br /> An American in Paris is still one of the best cinematic works ever made, and as studios no longer enjoy all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to repeat.
