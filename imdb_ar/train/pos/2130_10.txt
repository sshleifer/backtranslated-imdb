Wonderful film, full of great performance and sharp intelligent dialogue. But what really distinguishes the film is that sadness is the other. The story emphasizes affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, and fear of losing their jobs in a world that has had disastrous consequences. Most of all he was assigned to a world no longer exists, torn apart by the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is hardly a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with the viewer. However, it is funny - listening to Margaret Stewart's cruel dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and seeing his painful expression as he replies that her comments were a wonderful combination of "hair and sleepiness". It's funny, pointed, and sad at one time. Great achievement and one of the top 10 comedy movies ever.
