My character is very favorite in films, but almost all of the character Zorro contains a small cloth as a mask and if the villain can not figure out who is under this cloth it will be cloudy. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley`s Zorro`s Fighting Legion (1939), the mask fills the entire face, making it a real mystery to who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But anyway Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and updated, I think Anthony Hopkins in "Zoro Mask" (1998) is fun. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is broad, but I have a real desire in the 30 / 40s series .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
