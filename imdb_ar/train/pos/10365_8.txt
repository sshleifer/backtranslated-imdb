This is a true story of an Australian couple accused of murder when their baby disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to keep our interest even though she plays a particularly unpopular character. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy that surrounds this issue in Australia reminds us of Sam Sheppard's murder case in Ohio during the 50's. These real-life situations illustrate that the media can actually influence how the criminal case is handled. I remember well that Cleveland Blaine Diller was carrying a huge headline saying, "Why is not Sam Sheppard in prison?" The plaintiff eventually surrendered to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years of imprisonment was he acquitted. <br /> <br /> I like movies that tell a real story, I do it in an interesting way, and I made an important point in this process. This is one of those films. Other good films include the story of innocent people accused of "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latest film is another highly recommended Australian film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
