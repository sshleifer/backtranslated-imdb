When I saw this film again, I seemed to be very excited this time about the previous times I saw it. The representation is amazingly superb. The characters are clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply the prodigal son who rebels. Actors and other actresses are fine in every respect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period of modern days in the twenties. The scenery is incredibly beautiful from the mountains and streams in western Montana. All in all, this is one of the best films produced in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie! <br /> <br />
