This was a good film with a strong message of love and redemption. I loved the brother's transformation and the terrible consequences of the illness on the family. Good conduct and good guidance. If there are any drawbacks, I must say that the story showed the typical suburban family and its difficulties again. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I love watching a movie showing all these cultures - as in real life. However, the movie has risen in terms of its value and its understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to its maker. I loved the film and brought tears to my eyes
