After watching "Flicker" when one of AFM's distributors showed up the other night, I must say I was quite impressed. The audience was laughing all the way. Unfortunately, every area has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy the film, but I really think it will be a great success both domestic and international. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be presented as "Sex and the City" of males, mainly because unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire about dating that does not take itself on a load Grandpa. "Leather" makes fun of relationships in a way that most sex comedy does not dare. Also, the film I showed in the film AFM contains more than a story and a plot from the "Joker" and "Scribes" and "Sex and the City" combined. The program "Whipped" did not slow down and gave the audience a nonstop comedy. Amanda Pitt and the rest of the actors performed solid, making the film more impressive given the budget.
