I purchased a DVD from this version to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is great). It was written in 1985 by Arthur Hopkraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television, which died this year (2005). I remember the wonderful acting, especially of Rigg and Elliott, and animated music. (The music in version 2005 is much less valuable, but it is very clear.) Just to pick up other commentators at a few points: Richard Carston is Ada Claire's friend, not Esther. Esther was not his uncle. Charlie Drake Crock never played in either version, nor did he play Toby Estresas in TTSS! Krook was played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Bernard Hepton played a role as a Toby. <br /> <br /> Both versions are impressive and impressive adaptations of Dickens' brilliant novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and passion may make you go bankrupt sometimes, but I challenge you not to cry - and laugh!
