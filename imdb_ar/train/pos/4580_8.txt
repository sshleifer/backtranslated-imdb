Princess Tam Tam has no traces of racism, the way we think of racism in the United States, but there are more accurate assertions (of the American viewer) about ethnic identity during that time. Pay attention to the location of Alwina (Baker) within the footage, how other characters deal with her, and surrounding settings that are all portrayed as "brutal" African, and ask yourself whether Alwina has any influence throughout the film. I do not want to spoil anything, but in the end pay close attention, the division between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is less aggressive, such inspiration has been eliminated these days. The French have a volatile past as an imperialist force throughout the regions described (see Chris Marker Les Statues Meurent Aussi - 1953), paying attention to the places European travelers visit while in Africa, and what this reflects in their attitudes towards the "other". I give this movie 7 because I am a sucker for Baker, much of what I did in her career, such as princes Tam Tam, who is regressive certainly overwhelmed by her efforts towards integration, and her work as a strange spy (I'm gushing, sorry.) However, the film is captivating for her performance , As well as remnants of old mentality.
