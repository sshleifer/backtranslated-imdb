I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and Jack Wild are amazingly talented and now my girls love Jack Wild fans too. This film is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertainment. This film is not limited to children as well. Much dialogue is directed to adults and the performance of Witchiepoo is something you do not want to miss. The music in this film fits Jack Wilde and Mama Cass beautifully. As a fan of Jack Wild, I will never miss seeing him dance or listen to sing. Knowing Jack's hard life now makes this film even more wonderful, especially when he sings "If You Can". Makes me stop loving his love to give him wonderful childhood memories that I now transfer to my children. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! Keep Wild Wild Jack's memory by transferring Pufnstuff to others.
