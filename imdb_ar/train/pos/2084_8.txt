My main problem with the film is that it lasts for a long time. Other than that, it's very good. Paul Moni plays the role of a poor Chinese farmer about to marry through an arranged marriage. Louise Rainer is a maid girl who marries Monie. They live with Moni's father on a farm and do something very bad. When it finally gets some money to buy more land, the drought hits and nothing grows. Everyone is heading north toward Mooney at first. When they leave and arrive in the city, they find that their jobs are not jobs and they are in worse shape than before. They even think of selling their little daughter as a slave for some money, but they decide. When a group of people begin to loot the city, the army appears and executions begin. Paul Mony performed well and Louis Rainer won the second Oscar for this film.
