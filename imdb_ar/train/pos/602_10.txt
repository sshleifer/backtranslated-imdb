I have never played flamenco before, but somehow I felt that the film was wonderful. The colors, the dance dances, the gypsies, and the competitors all made a film that seemed to end very soon. I have seen other Carlos Saura films and agree that this film might be his best production. I feel that the best properties of his previous films have been put together and their consistency with Iberia. I appreciate using mirrors to detect the activity behind the cameras. While watching this film, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, and I watched with satisfaction the dancers knocking on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits like gloves. I do not know how I will be able to get a copy of this film in the US in the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely included in my favorites list.
