William Powell is unforgettable. He is glad to see him on the screen as he makes his way in positions without care in the world. He always looks at the top of his game and shows no great interest to anyone who doubts it. Homicides are projects, hardly human beings. I noticed that this is the main element of whodunnit. Unlike the widow who cries from time to time, the victims do a job as the reason for the film. nothing else. There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way, and Paul is the master in this. There are a lot of political mistakes, especially with regard to Asian artists. This is a bit hard to take. The cast is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a steady asset.
