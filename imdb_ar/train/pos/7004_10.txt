Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how to do it. I read the books constantly but if there was a movie with Will Smith I would see it. He has a rare gift to drag you to the movie and your detention there. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen so far. I saw him on Saturday and I still can not get him out of my head. Amazing and sad all at the same time. Thanks again will. You should watch this movie from start to finish to understand every part of the movie. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your leg / woman sitting next to you so you can embrace well, you deserve the money you will pay to watch it .. Do not wait for it to appear on TV.
