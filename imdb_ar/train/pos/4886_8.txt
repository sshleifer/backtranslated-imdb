The Last of the Blond Bombshells are an entertaining part of the fluff. Judy Dench plays Elisabeth, a new widowed woman at loose ends. She spent most of her life in being the unsuspecting wife and mother, but she was never happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth spends a regular lunch with her muddy husband. Children spotted the street performer. This evokes memories when she was a member of a band for all girls in London during World War II. We soon learned that the band was not all a girl exactly because the drummer was wearing a woman's style like Some Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth withdraws Saxha (whom she secretly practiced throughout her marriage) and joins forces with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than a guitarist, and money starts to flow. It does not take any money because it is rich and does not need it. Their game is only for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth was seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the band's drummer. It seems that Patrick - and still - is a ladies' man, and Elizabeth - being only 15 at the time - was the only band member who did not experience Patrick's "talents" other than the drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together again to play for the granddaughter's dance. Thus begins an enjoyable journey in the lane of memory along with aspects of a humorous journey film - all topped by some really good swings and blues. <br /> <br /> I think that in an era when I really enjoy the older actors doing their stuff, this film is a treasure not only about the stars of Judy Dench, but it is supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Karon, and a group of actresses British veterans. All this is topped by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Lin. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a fluff, but it is very delightful and very enjoyable.
