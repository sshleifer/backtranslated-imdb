Perhaps this film is my favorite film of all time. Miriam Flynn is as excellent as Banny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the crew is fantastic, and the film is really funny. Clear spelling of horror movies, with zany twist. If you enjoy a fun and comedy evening, go and rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
