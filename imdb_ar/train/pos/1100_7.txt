- After getting tired of the rat race and narrow living conditions of New York City, Cary Grant finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a home proves to be simple. With the onset of headache and billing, laughter is compounded. Will Mr. Blanding get the house of his dreams? <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant, Mirna Lowe and Melvin Douglas. None of the three are able to carry a movie on their own, so when they combine their talents, each scene is almost special. Grant has always been my favorite in this kind of role. It's very good at playing put on the pair. Louie always has a joy to watch. The Thane Man films I made with William Powell are close to perfection. Douglas has become my favorite past two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a favorite film for me. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely the product of his time. Get a kick Imagine the time you can build a two-storey house, three bedrooms and a bathroom of fourteen thousand dollars a year. Get rid of the fact that your children go to a private school and that you have a live maid and it becomes fanciful. <br /> <br /> - However, for anyone who bought or built a house, many of the situations and dilemmas Blanding finds themselves in are easily linkable to today. Here comes the role of comedy. How many people have done some stupid things that the couple do in this film just to cost more money than expected? - My biggest complaint about Mr. Blanding is the story of "the wife who loves your best friend." It is not really necessary for the plot and feels that it is misplaced and very inconvenient as it has been presented.
