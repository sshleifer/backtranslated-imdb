I'm a big fan of Steven King's work, and this film made me more impressed with King King. Pet Sematary is about family creed. They've just moved into a new home, and they seem happy. But there is a cemetery for pets behind their house. Judd Kreid the new neighbor (played by Fred Goyen) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That the land of burial is pure evil. Judd Lewis Creed tells that when he buries a man (or any pet) in the land of burial, they will return to life. The only problem is that when they return, they are not the same people, they are evil. After a short time Jud explains everything about Sematary Pet, everything starts to go to hell. I will not explain anymore because I do not want to give up some of the key parts of the film. The acting was that the Sematary pet was very good, but it needed a little work. The story was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was original and dominant. This film features many of the make-up effects that make the film's way more exotic and scary. One of the main reasons why this film sent chills in my back, was actually the effects of make-up. There is one character in this film is really terrible. That character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times to be accurate. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed, who died years earlier, but Rachel is still living there. The first time Zelda appears in the film is not generally scary because she does not speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and frankly, the second time frightens the living from me. There's nothing wrong with this film, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers great fear, some good acting, a first-class plot, and a charming make-up. This is really one of the most favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
