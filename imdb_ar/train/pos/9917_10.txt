This is the most confrontational documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and amazing view of a beautiful idea. Based on images of hidden industrial landscapes that focus on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Portinsky presents life in the face of issues we have easily chosen to ignore. <br /> <br /> With no political aspect, this film is a neutral image of the realities our Western societies choose not to educate - by-products of economic growth, external factors driven by citizens in less developed societies, our source of comfort and waste methods Our consumer lives. <br /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey but worth a visit - please stop staying ignorant and seeing these truth images at least without feeling any pressure to take a stand on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
