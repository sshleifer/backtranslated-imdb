BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant films ever produced. I was lucky enough to pick them up, along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris, at the New York Video Festival a few years ago and then I bought a copy of the Trent website. This movie must be seen as thought! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent's name on the internet and then buying the movie from its location. He's an incredibly nice guy to take off. Do not confuse you: Illustrator in the fictional sections of TRAVELY BEAVER Trent! <br /> <br /> After seeing TRILOGY several times, I must admit that it is likely that I would do without Shawn Ben version. It's like a trial version of Crispin Glover's "Orkly Kid" and it's more interesting as a curiosity if you're a Penn fan than a good video. Penn is very funny, however, you can watch what a great star does in this wonderful B & W video. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is also one of the best Crispin Glover roles and I just love to see an update of a documentary film about the original Groovin 'Gary. Once you watch this movie, you will never get Gary's nervous laugh from your head again.
