I was an intro in an old theater in northern California when this film came out. As good as on the DVD, it is even more terrifying and terrifying on the big screen. Although it has been around 9 years since I saw it, it is still one of my favorite things. At risk of vulgar sounding, "They just do not make like this anymore!" If you are afraid of Sixth Sense at all, this movie is definitely for you! Great story, incredible cast of characters, ominous situation. Even the soundtrack has a haunting quality for it. I strongly recommend that you do not see it alone. What was renting a brown stone apartment in 1977 alone, will make you gasp (it will be 10 times at least this price today).
