The film seemed to be wandering in an "immoral study." I probably did not share much in the artist's urgent need to redeem male nudes and so all the trouble about "Now, drawing this penis?" Seemed a little unjustified. I dug it when Tasi arrived to draw a mental picture but then the film came back to the bar .It is highly recommended to those who have not seen one in a while.
