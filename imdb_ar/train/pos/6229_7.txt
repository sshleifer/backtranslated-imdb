One of the many musicals about seafarers on vacation, it is the usual seas that meet with the girl, and the ensuing complications, happily classified as a kind of plot. It goes smoothly enough but pulls in places too. The dialogue is not as graceful as "Top Hat" for example, and Randolph Scott seems to be misplaced. <br /> <br /> There are damages. Contains some selected songs in Irving Berlin including "Let Yourself Go", "I Put All My Eggs in One Basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance". He has Fred and Ginger when they dance on any movie in heavenly heights and do not disappoint here. They are dancing, dancing, dancing and dancing, all in the same movie! Great craftsmanship and craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Harriet also has a good heliard in her role. She had a diverse career, and Harriet Nelson became more famous with Ozzie. Here you touch without being emotionally. Where two songs are delivered simply and effectively. They contrast well with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More stress makes the film better. Very good though.
