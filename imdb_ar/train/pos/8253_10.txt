This is the first film I have to watch last year! It's unbelievably wicked, incredibly funny, and unbelievably beautiful (they've gone to this wonderful view of the wide screen technicolor, which is really wonderful and what it says about the community.) It's a really intelligent spelling that labels everything from internal security to race, At the same time he lets you laugh and realize how much the world is living in fear Carrie Ann Moss is turning into a comedic performance I never imagined he would come from It is sweet, funny and exciting Billy Connolly is as wonderful as Fido who can only groan and groan! Henry Charney as a bad man, and Tim Blake Nelson Kegar with his full-fledged girlfriend Uh hot (get the idea now?) Funny and interesting and totally amazing! Go and see this movie! It's like anything I've seen before.
