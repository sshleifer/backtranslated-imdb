"Saving grace" is not funny at all, but it offers a few good laughs and has enjoyed it greatly. Brenda Blythin is a wonderful actress and does a good job of portraying widow Grace, who resorts to growing marijuana to repay her huge debts. Cast support also has a good job. French actor Chique Carrillo has a funny little role. The hypothesis alone is attractive. The idea of ​​a woman growing and smoking a pot seems funny enough. The film plays around with a wisely premise from time to time. Of course, there are flat moments, such as those where two elderly women in marijuana leaves grope for tea leaves and begin to pull out the childish alien from the store where they work. It was a reckless gag that did not take off. The tone of the film is pessimistic and sometimes boring, but I laughed enough to give a recommendation to import this English. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 7 (out of 10)
