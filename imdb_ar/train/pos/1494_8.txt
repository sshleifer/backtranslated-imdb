A stylish display from Amicus, Milton Subotsky, Peter Duffell ("The Far Pavillions," etc.) turns into smart "four clips" with powerful actors (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) All offer elegant performances, despite the low budget that leads to a few "non-special effects". However, the most prominent contribution is the contribution of 7-year-old Chloe Franks who plays an effective role in chilling her role, making the person's blood cold. Just spoiled by the mysterious title the distributors wished for the film, this reduced version, a top clip of the stunning film "The Blood of Courage," is for those who can think little of their horror. .
