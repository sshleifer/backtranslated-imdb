I really like this show, it's like reading a book and leaving you every chapter you want more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle to maintain their friendship over the years. After each episode, leave a delicious taste in your mouth with the knowledge that: one - the presentation was good, and you can not wait until the next episode, which really makes you think of what is really happening to friends over the course of twenty years. And secondly - the fact that the show has been placed on a "stop" and we will not see the expiry of the entire show. It's clear that Fox does not know what they've done, they claim to be losing viewers in 18-49, and obviously do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show like Reunion. I have one query though I would like to raise it. If they want to repeat the show and continue for another season, how will it succeed because each episode is executed within a year and the story is based on what happens within twenty years? Your answers are very welcome. Reunion! Reunion!
