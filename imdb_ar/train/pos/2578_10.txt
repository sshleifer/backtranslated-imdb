The adventures of Superman and Mole Men are very likely to be Superman's most difficult adventure ever. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the home of the deepest oil well in the world. While there, some radioactive mole come over the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Currie and many of the townspeople are trying to get rid of the mole invaders. Can Superman change people's ways in a timely manner to save mole men? Can Superman warn people in a timely manner of the radiation hazard that mole men bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie Superman and Molly is a very intelligent and well written film. Although we have only seen Superman fly once briefly, it still makes Superman's adventure wonderful. Must see for anyone. <br /> <br /> Stars
