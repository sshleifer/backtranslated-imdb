Despite skipping the target audience, I've always been a great place for YA imagination, so, I was naturally fascinated by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film. The central puzzle involving a long dead actress is presented in simplified and clear terms with dashes of danger to young people. Nancy and her friends do not take threats seriously, so they will not bother the young audience. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciate from the story is that the final results were serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand them and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is as wonderful as Nancy Drew and we hope to see her again in another mystery.
