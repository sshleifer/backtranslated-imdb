Walking a tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest things in film. How can you laugh at the misery of others and do not start to feel bad when it lasts a long time? <br /> <br /> Well, this amazing little gem of a movie will offer great great laughs and pretty beautiful landscapes that are also good buzz. I particularly like the notion that the trick of history made alcohol legal because white Europeans were impressed by it, and marijuana was illegal, because "those other races" used it ... without a doubt true and revealed a racist aspect of the marijuana laws that the population boasts around the world. <br /> <br /> There is an extra Extra DVD comment ... two of them actually ... are showing the entire movie with actors, then again with the book. I kept seeing things that I was sure were not there in the first film, but then I realized how easy it was to miss a lot of fine comics in the first film. What a shout! do not miss! 9/10 Stars
