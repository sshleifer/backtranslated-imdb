So, pull the Fox plug halfway through the drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How is this lame? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new programs when there is a real risk of not finding out what is happening? Why are not the remaining episodes already filmed in the United States? Broadcasted elsewhere. <br /> <br /> O Fox! do you hear? This was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you're going to make a dramatic show / new puzzle, you have to at least release it before it suddenly ends in mid-appearance. Every time something like this happens (it seems to happen a lot to you - ie, Fox), there are a lot of "wait and see" before investing their time. This means you'll see an artificially low interest rate, and you're likely to end the series. We see? It is a vicious circle. Do not let us down again ...
