This is worth 12 out of 10. A very refreshing view with real characters and real stories. This show needs to come back, I've seen each episode which is of real quality. <br /> <br /> The show is centered around a couple of New Yorkers, playing around the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwining their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are amazing as well as the adorable Kaesman. The view is stunning and the wardrobes are fantastic. <br /> <br /> We need more offers like this that make viewers feel smart and not unmanned. <br /> <br /> If you never return, six degrees will miss you.
