I liked this show very much - we got the first and only series, apparently, in Channel Four. The description was true on money - just like the Simpson family where all the different aspects of the small town inhabitants were represented. <br /> <br /> There was no track of laughter - I did not see that on an American television comedy at the time except for Larry Sanders and it worked well here, which added to the fact that these idiots were really like that, not Just disable it for cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a small twinkle tickles me perfectly: I can only think that maybe some fans missed it. I think it would have been a great success in the UK if it was introduced in an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I will come close to this with my standard comment: Where can I hang this hell? See it again? any ideas?
