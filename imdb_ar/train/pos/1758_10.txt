I was really surprised by this film. When going to the sneak preview and not knowing anything about the movie except for the first cross-section I saw, I thought it would be a Dude Where's My Car. I was expecting bad sexual jokes and the pathetic and pathetic leading personality that will be put in the end because that's how the movies work. Instead, I got an original and amazingly intelligent film about an average, gentle man who never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is full of vulgar sexual jokes and ridicule and the show festival sometimes. -nipple !, but they did a lot in the spirit of the Santa Fe instead of the boys' boys club. All characters are people you may know in real life, friends can be replaced and they just try to link a brother who lives their lives. <br /> <br /> I was thinking that this movie would be a complete folly, I was very surprised. Yes, it ended up pretty much (come on, it's about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it was done with great intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really pull this guy. For a situation, which says a lot about the film because it's honest, do you really care if Ashton Kutcher finds his car or not?
