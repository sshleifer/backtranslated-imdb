This film revolves around this attractive man who decided to become a spy for a high-tech glamor called Digicorp. This cowardly man, Morgan (Jeremy Northham) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his arduous wife until he decides to become a spy. It is supposed to go to conferences of other high-tech companies and know all corporate plans. Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and largely surpassed by those two companies that forced him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get out of this? Can he trust in the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (whose role played Lucy Liu)? More importantly, can Morgan make him alive? Wonderful! What a neat movie! I was completely absorbed after 15 minutes watching this movie. It is very worrying and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion because he is doing his best to survive. The scene in which they put this terrible hood at the head of Morgan to brainwash is creepy and frighteningly brilliant. Morgan is slowly passing through a personal transformation that is not easily apparent until she thinks about it after the film ends. From a cowardly man with bad hair and glasses, turns into a man who is actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> Finish, Wow, End Incredible! Evolution a lot of fun! Leave me panting and cheering like crazy! Good offers from everywhere, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Luce and Bennett Nigel. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
