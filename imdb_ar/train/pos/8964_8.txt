A few happy coincidences in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak created Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece "Vertigo" made this light comedy. Perhaps the actors had to do so after they had gone through the heavyweight of Hitchcock. In any case, this wonderful accompaniment to "Vertigo" again explores a very strong and unbearable love story. In fact, the film can be seen as the other side of the "Vertigo" happy ending. Here again, passing Novak transformation, in Dortigo, mainly play two women and here turn from charming to human beings. He is the charm of Stewart again and for a moment tormented by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two meet together in the "Bell Book and Candle", the perfect antidote to Hitcock. Again the dynamics of love and gravity are examined but in a completely different way. The cast is wonderful. Lemmon hilarious as Novak's charming brother and Elsa Lancaster give a classic performance like Auntie. Ernie Kovacs is an alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermione Gingold plays the role of Novak's all-great competitor. The scene with Stewart drinking dose is comedy at its best. Anyone has seen Vertigo or even if you do not see this light comedy memorable.
