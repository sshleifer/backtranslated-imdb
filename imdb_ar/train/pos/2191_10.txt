Shakespeare said we are in a great stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are filled with a difficult way. Dan Katzir runs an amazing picture of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but Katzir succeeds in reaching the heart of the Israeli people, and this people is far from being a simple figure, speaking to us from the heart. A film that allows Israel to escape the essence of the dark information in which they live, and this wonderful country is born to light as a wonderful bird born of ashes. It is great for me because the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans know only in media journals or newspapers, appears as an absolute human reality, and the reality of millions of people searching for its place, exploring the whole of the state, and culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir builds a perfectly impressive documentary film, and shows that when a man portrays passion, the deepest feelings are displayed, and these emotions pass through our hearts. Thank you Dan for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful pictures of the world's finest.
