To be honest, I had to go back to see this film, and I did not expect much, but hey, I was not misled, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film is a new breeze, although some facts have tried to update it from Nancy Drew, but that made me remember these young films between the ages of 60 and 70 from Europe and Quebec, where They were able to make children interact with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to solve justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. However, since her father was working in Hollywood, why not hire a mysterious house behind the doors? Well, at least, Emma Roberts is doing a great job here. Canada is like a chubby child, who was initially brought naively to support his sister's snaps to Nancy, but in the end, she found Nancy cool enough to stick with her, even with her things ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the support team is wonderful, Happy to see Rachel Lee Cook in a different role this time: Single mother (I did it in "Family Rescue", but this time, she was playing the role of a mature woman ...) 't dump this, it's fun!
