I discovered this title by chance with the Grindhouse folder. One set of Euro-trash movies. But this film has a nice stamp of approval and deserves a better transfer than it is there. Stupid it is not ... Satisfy it! Watching this film I could not have wondered ... How did Sergio Martino do this? This has his signature everywhere and is interspersed with Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately not as well known as she should have but she got a beautiful veil in Hostel II). Double and triple intersections intersect the bottom and reinforce this film from start to finish with Lee van Cliff nudging the cold under the pressure of the first second. Should this man go to Italy to finally reach his potential or have you left the studio system that person slip? In addition to my most famous films, filmgoers should try out this for size and find out if Sergio Lyon has reduced his epic size once in America to half the show time (and 1/4 of the budget) that's what he'll be The case. Very refreshing, it must be eaten during the day at home and make it in the couch room
