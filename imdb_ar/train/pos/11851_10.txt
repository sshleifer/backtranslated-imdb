At a time when Hollywood is gaining money by showing weakness, despair, crime, drugs and war, this film reminds us of the concept of "invincible spirit." If you feel upset, this movie will free your mind and make you rise. We all know how difficult life is, at some point we need to be reminded that perseverance and courage will lead us. This is what this film did for me and I hope it does that for you.
