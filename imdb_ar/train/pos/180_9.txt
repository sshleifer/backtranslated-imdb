When Gundam0079 became the trilogy of films most of us knew, many of them were just less than anything else. This OVA is kinda the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, they are not filled with deeds, but with emotional things. I believe that the two main lines of action in this matter are sufficient to satisfy me. After watching many of the series, films and movies of Gendam, I was completely ready for a civil film. This film has done a great job in it. What makes this film stand out is that both sides of the war are showing good and bad people. It made the film seem more human than the original films, which were portrayed as the second upsurge of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the cartoon that forced to watch this movie (lol), are impressed. So, I recommend a lot of people just to the anti-war story. If you love Gundam and do not see this, you should not read this; you should already be watching it.
