As far as satirical films go, there are few of them worth the time and energy. But with the resurgence of the recent horrifying parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's refreshing air to go back and rediscover a really funny farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother endlessly endures medical problems, Johnny goes to work for the mob. What FAP is a series of gags, most of which work, however, there are sometimes flops. But a foreign guerilla can not master the American language (at least wise words), a rival gangster has a tendency to shoot his mouth (... once!), A younger brother with D.A. Who will get Johhny Dangerously, and a hot young star hot because of his emotions, busy Johnny. <br /> <br /> The viewer will often laugh, because all the blockbuster cliches are distorted by a talented and respectable crew. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect with a long shot, but it's definitely good to smile on a bad day.
