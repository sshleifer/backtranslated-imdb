It's a racist film, but it deserves to be studied and enjoyed. The first time through which the natural tendency is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a peaceful and comfortable thing, and still with her at home is about to graduate from high school, retire and kick in waiting for inspiration to do something. The second time through you you realize how terrifying the sister's husband is by her friends at the Packwood Blues Strip. He takes it, it's what he does these days, and the critical moment goes on as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene, the blues blister song is a real gig for tears if you are a little less sensitive and like that kind of music. Its performance seems like the height of the story. The story of the blues with good men "people of color" in their element in backwoods, SC. At the same time, all the white people in the film lead what seems to be a shallow life meaningless and fit only children. This is fantastic, as long as you realize it's a fantasy.
