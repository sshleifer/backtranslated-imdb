For anyone who expects a traditional film, this may be an unpleasant surprise. It is definitely a drama rather than action films. He focuses mainly on emotions and is somewhat like the Greek tragedy - regardless of the main character he does, he always errs in some way. <br /> <br /> Because Sasha, like all superheroes, takes the law in his hands the community can not afford it. Sasha becomes outlawed. During his escape, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love until things become more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really exciting but the film lacks dynamics. It reminds me a bit of narration in the modern films of Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is a scene movement becomes so dynamic that before you realize what is going on, it's over. But the director does not want to convince us of a pleasant and flashy work. The most important thing here is the result of Sasha's works, which are mostly very radical. The result is very rare, making the focus on the film more difficult. So you should be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? This is a difficult question to answer. I do not think this experience has affected me much, but I'm still thinking about this film and feel it again. Mostly because of the atmosphere, it is really thick, but not suffocating because both Sasha and Katya have always had hope. After all they are young, who have all their lives to live. So no matter how hard it is, there is always a simple joy tune when they are together.
