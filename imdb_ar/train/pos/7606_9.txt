The first series of Lost started with a bang ... literally slowly falling in pace. This may have stopped some viewers, but people who started to watch halfway will feel bored or confused. <br /> <br /> I recommend new people in the Lost world to simply watch events from the start and not fall into slow loops. The representation everywhere is excellent but why have you planned the 5 series ... why ??? All this means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years, well, I will continue to watch whether it leads to increased tension and the flow of dialogue.
