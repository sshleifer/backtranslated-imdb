"Who Likes the Sun" makes his way through some thorny subjects with enough intelligence and grace to keep the story not only attractive, but often hilarious. It's been some time since I've found a great and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is wonderful, attracting the eye to beautiful and quiet landscapes. The calmly contrasting images are contrasted with the tension between very human characters, extremely flawed, and yet very beloved. Due to the outstanding actors, the Big 5 players enjoy great attention and dynamism. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun". It is a really funny film that takes a painful look at the hurt that we can attach to each other, and the process of tolerance is difficult and surprising.
