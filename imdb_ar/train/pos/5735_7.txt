This is a short and moving animated series by David Lynch (as she says at the beginning), which follows the adventures of the backyard, a large man in overall clothes, with a wife suffering from stress disorder and an annoying son. Each of these elements is thrown repeatedly in short rings, and there is no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of it as a very strange Looney Tunes, with lots of nasty words, bloody violence and unexpected moments of fun. <br /> <br /> I purchased a DVD with Eraserhead, previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want a masterpiece - this is something else. In fact, it seems to be a statement against such things, as his rough style spits against any kind of animation you might see. "If it's funny, it's funny because we see the absurdity of all this," says Lynch.
