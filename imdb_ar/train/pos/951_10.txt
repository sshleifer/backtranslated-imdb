I know that many people have a passion for the Alistair Sim version of the Dickens story, but for me, this 1984 version is the version to be overcome. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS, and we watch it all on Christmas Eve. I often notice that we may see it on Halloween too, because it's a very scary ghost story. <br /> <br /> Scott - typecast as Scrooge - means very poorly and badly, making his transformation more miraculous and moving. I think it's due to his performance in Patton. Spirits are all effective, each one creepy from the past. Watching the dark and floating shape and skeleton of the Christmas spirit after sending sends shivers down every year. What the cast support! David Warner, in particular, at his best like Bob Crashit, as well as Suzanna York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to remember that this version is more about the original story than any other story - but I might be wrong, it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a fantastic Christmas classic.
