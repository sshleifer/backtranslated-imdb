I think this is a great release, I came here before, to help me find the version I should use and went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from the users comment and then helped me get this version. I do not regret choosing this version and will not do it. You have tried to see all other versions and none of them matched either, nothing like the book, and TRUST ME if you read the book you want something to match. When looking for something real and moving after reading a book, it is difficult because you want something that fits in with it. I would say God personally led me to this version. It refers to the true love of man. I would like to say that God's love is greater. If there is anything better, I would like to see it. But so far there is nothing like it!
