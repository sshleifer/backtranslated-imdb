As a fan of more in-depth shooting in schools, this film took a different and exciting approach to the idea. It was shown as a series of videos prepared by the turbulent men (I can not refer to people who are killed as boys or teenagers), the most famous setting that leads to a zero day (the code name of the day they will attack). The film tries to show the situation from the other end of the gun. She seems determined to portray the pain they are suffering, with a focus on crafting. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point where the passion was overwhelming was the end, as expected. But before this point, it is never clear why they planned it. We were told the mandatory story they ridiculed, but the film seems to contradict this. Without sabotaging the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and equally important intentions, but it is short because of slow filmmaking. Each amateur output, to promote the concept of homemade video, but the story and continuity is weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but it also fails to provide information for such an event. The ending is sudden, and it does not feel like it's all finished by the movie.
