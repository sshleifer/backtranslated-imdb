Quietly romantic comedy with intertwined sub-layouts intertwined beautifully with actors who line up in parallel with a meticulous comic timing, is a remarkable achievement. When a Chinless vocalist asks her to help him make peace with his strangest younger brother and mood, no one can dream of the consequences. Symbolic play, Catholic Church confessions, love bites and snowfall ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes (there is an early sequence with the grandfather with his dogs in the graveyard, which is a little difficult, and the next scene with Cosmo and the old man at the gate seems to be exuberant), but a mixture of plot intertwined with intelligence skill, the tone of the film and kooky spirit on the edge Both infectious. *** 1/2 of ****
