Little bit of excitement. I was expecting some kind of silly horror movies, but what I got was a short, tight film that does not waste any time in our time. In most of these films, we have to go into the background stories, so we will feel sympathy or hatred when people start killing. O foolishness here. Yes, some people see it but interact only with school principals. Such as the wife of the husband in the hotel whose room was canceled. We've seen them so we can figure out how efficient Lisa is and how inefficient the new hotel clerk is. We see the young girl simply because she will play a small but important role later in the film when everyone breaks down. Atlantis trip because we need in particular to move the plot forward. The bad man especially needs her at the beginning of the journey. The rude man at the airport was important to the film as well. The only two people who were only five lines without any benefit to the scheme are the two young men on board. It was smart because I thought they had a relationship with the plot. From the first scene to another woman's character, an executive at a young hotel named Lisa is responsible. Even when Jackson shows his true colors, they do not panic. She thinks about what she can do to stop time. Any other executive women would act smart like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short film and I waited until the usual drawing devices began to appear because the film seemed to be coming to an end quickly. Thanks no one used them. The new hotel employee did not call the usual and told her what to do. It was a panic that he dropped the phone and ran out of the hotel without saying anything, or questioned your boss and told her she had to drink a lot and separate it. Craven should have done more of these types of movies. Also one more comment. Brian Cox is in the film but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he was Lisa's father. It is completely unknown.
