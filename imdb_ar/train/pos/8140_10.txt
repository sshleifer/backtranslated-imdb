I saw this movie for the first time on some movie channels (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of the general enemy, NWA and other early rap and I watched CB4 in the theaters. Anyway, I got my promo attention, and I wanted to see what was going on around it. Well, right away, you know it would be good (warning!) And you're right. Singing songs alone make this movie worth seeing again and again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the film was great. You must love the spelling of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget the deafening scratching tone with his ass? It's very bad that this film did not get the credit it deserved, because it was dominated by CB4 during its releases, but in my opinion it is a much better film. If you know and love rap "gangs" in the nineties, you will watch this movie and laugh for a long time. If you are not in the "rap" or you do not like it, you will enjoy jokes on the genre account.
