Paris is the place to enjoy art and beautiful music, and to fall in love madly - as in this film. Boy meets the girl, they fall in love, but there is something in their way of eternal happiness, the classic story. <br /> <br /> The wonderful music of George Gershwin complements the wonderful dance of Jenny Kelly and Leslie Karon. "American in Paris" is a light-hearted comic film worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
