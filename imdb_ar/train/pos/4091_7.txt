I saw this film at a cinema in London in 1975 and I have not seen it since. I found it hilarious. I loved it's originality. It's rare for someone to make a movie like this - and that's very sad. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that I once read a book called The Black Hotel - and as a movie fan, I've always been "pictures" written as movies. Kinda "adapt" to them, you know? But I read that, well, I think that would make a great film - but of course it should be "adaptive" - ​​to the extent that there is little to do with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, Well why? Sure, it can not be shown on TV on Sunday afternoon, but provided that it is screened in cinemas on adults, who know what it contains, where is HARM? Damn, my civil liberties have been crushed here. The director must be able to edit a masterpiece of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult film censorship should not be there. But unfortunately, while accepting that with intelligent adults, this freedom may be innocuous, and there will always be those who lack the rationality to distinguish fantasy from reality, who may be urged to commit grave acts. <br /> However, it is hard to see how "La Bete" falls into this category. <br /> <br /> As for her appearance in England, the British sergeant refused to take control. Despite the relaxation that occurred in 69 because of nudity, given the theoretical theme of the film, that the sergeant had passed any of them, he was looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> But ... in those days, there was an alternative. J. The. This was a local council of the city whose administration had the ability to pass a film to London only, where it was considered that the masses were "more sophisticated" than those who lived in sticks. <br /> <br /> The movie has been duly submitted and passed. However, it later emerged that the "board" was composed of only four people - three voted, in addition to the "head". One day, a voter was sick. So the remaining voters and the chairman sat to watch "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of the voters mentioned, like me, thought that the film was a joy and unlikely to encourage malicious acts by anyone. The other lacks imagination and simply thought of a disgusting piece. The president did not understand this, so he decided to make a mistake with FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the lost voter finally saw the movie, they also thought it disgusting, but it was recently! The film got the certificate "X-London" and opened on different reactions. J. The. The film censorship board was dissolved soon after! Thus, the film "La Bete" opened in London only through the best of what can be called "Flock"! But I'm glad it was. it's great! If you do not see it, do so. It's a fantasy, and so it's less disturbing than most of the things you see in the news these days ...
