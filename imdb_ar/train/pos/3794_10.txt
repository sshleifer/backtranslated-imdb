The song "Our Song" gives us the life of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelin - the best friends hanging at the end of the summer. Summer teenagers - even if we do not know the signs and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is the same for all of us. A lazy break from school stress and disorder. Welcome to heat and laziness. <br /> <br /> But if this adolescent experience is universal, the inner city in the 1990s is a place different from what most of us know - perhaps a foreign country like any other country. The bodies of youth carve a new silhouette ... occupy new territory ... maze towards puberty. The little mind comes to himself, speaks for himself, and says this is what I am, and that is what I want to try. He / she was always so. But that was how it was shown in Brooklyn in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the writer / director of this film project but admits all those who have read the suggestions. It seems that the opening title segment of "Movie B" includes everyone in the universe. It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it's real. [The final titles also contain some of the most acclaimed and appreciated credits.] Live recording by Jean McLaughlin deserves special mention. Mkay is a humble leader who knows who tells this story - it is his three blessings to Anisha, Maria and Joyceleen. It is the real thing, and its interactions have a fire of true friendship and a focus on reality. This is not a short video story about adolescent life. It involves the risk of long, unrelated stare. <br /> <br /> We can not feel depressed, but we feel proud to hear it. These are real voices that speak clearly about crises. And eloquence of everyday life. We are witnessing the modern mathematics of teenage life - how its problems are explained, calculated, summarized and solved. Small scenes illustrate great ideas all over. Lanisha is hanging with her father in his security job - this is the only way she spends time with him. We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of the family and fatherhood. In a connected scene, Anaisha defends her father to her mother, and see how much she desperately needs their love and to love her in return. Later, the three friends share the dark visions and dreams - and remember how the craziest / more ridiculous children are, how the perfect realism beats these days. In the end, Maria simply walk down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gathering the courage to hold all her fears and doubts in the Gulf. You have shown us the power one needs to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable. <br /> <br /> "The greatest gift of our song is that we really feel the terrible false nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and invigorating, this intimate relationship, the next day, can only drift away. That's what it is, is not it?
