(William H. Messi) finally decides to leave the family business (a murder for hire) run by his father, who is very calm (Donald Sutherland) while seeing shrinkage) and flirt with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a first-rate thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets with "The Professional". Messi and Sutherland are the lead here. Marked debut for the writer / filmmaker Henry Bromel. I am surprised that this film did not get a chance to stay in the theaters for more than two weeks.
