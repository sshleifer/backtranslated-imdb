Am I the only person who has seen the relationship between the discussion of Camus "the myth of Sisyphus" and Mary's life? In the Camus version, a man is judged to spend eternity with a giant rock that must be towed by the hill. Unfortunately, every time you reach the top, the rock slides and ends at the bottom to begin. Maybe there's a buzzer in his eyes, I'm not sure now. In the film, Mary spends her life struggling to gather her life together, and unfortunately every time you win any foot you drop and lose everything. An example of this is the party where they throw him drunk, abuse her lover Falafel, and come under attack by Liev Schrieber. If you are wondering about this theory, observe how this scene ends by trying to climb a series of stars while books fall from anywhere to hinder its progress until it finally ends. The next morning when you wake up, still on the stairs, never reached the top.
