City of Lost Children (enhanced senses or anything used or abused, often, well, just give us less than we might dream of), and /> <br /> The Dark City: <br /> <br /> These things must really be added. <br /> <br /> For a while now, I was waiting for an animated movie that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Well, scratch the "moving" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have a strong hatred and hatred relationship with noir film, hey, if you do not leave, you should be mostly love, right? But, there are a lot of science fiction subjects and noir submerged in this film so much that it's amazing to see them. <br /> <br /> These guys did a great job!
