"All Dogs Go to Heaven" Fantastic movie, I saw it in 1989 When I was two years old, I did not understand it well but as I saw it I started to love it more and more, I love the songs in this The film, My Favorite Song is "Let Me Surprise" and "Soon You'll Be Back Home". These songs are beautiful. The only thing that bothers me is the movie Charlie dies, and when I was little, my sister could not see this part, other than that this movie was awesome. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of the movie is when Annabel and Charlie fly the beautiful sky in the movie and the "watches" are very smart, I also love Itchy, actually I have three of my own german dogs. She is so nice. <br /> <br /> In general, I like this movie and suggested that everyone see it, I give this movie a 10/10 stars.
