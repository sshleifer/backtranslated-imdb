He travels snakes in the depths of the forest in search of their targets; he is a brilliant South American drug man and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> Sniper has been fairly successful in building an atmosphere of hugs, which is often a very exciting film, takes time, and builds characters, tribulations and climax in some good work sequences. Director Losa does not always succeed in maintaining a gloomy mood and the story may be somewhat manageable; some of the detours here do not add much. But this film is much better than his film Stallone / Stone The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zani, usually incredibly tired, achieves amazingly amazing performance with the collaboration of an inexperienced Sniper with veteran Berenger. For Berger, this film proved to be the latest Hollywood project with a big budget. He can do these kinds of roles in his sleep and is very convincing here, and he plays the role twice more directly in DVD sequences.
