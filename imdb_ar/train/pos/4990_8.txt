As other reviewers have noted, this is a shadowy film in the Depression. Directed by Frank Borsage (two Oscars) and written by Joe Suerling (Leave it to Paradise, Western, Lifeboat, etc.), it's a neat and well organized thought move around the shantytowns of New York City. They are more than beggars, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people, bad or bad, and their loyalties are as complex as any. <br /> <br /> You may be essential in many of the great qualities of this movie. Is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Loretta Young Terena. He is strong-spoken, physically aggressive, and obviously without fear - but Bill is not the character that gives this film his strong sense of survival. While in a state of violence, Trina is virtually suspended (if the term can be applied to a very polite character). Her sincerity is clear and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says she will lift her up if he wants to leave, or "I will give up if I'm just happy." This is the dignity of the performance of Loretta Young (at the age of twenty) as a very simple figure, so do not look weak or certified, but a woman who recognizes happiness when you find it, and do not want anything more.
