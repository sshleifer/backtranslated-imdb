I always enjoy this movie when it appears on TV. <br /> <br /> The only scene that always stands out for me is the scene with Mirna Loy and the painters Foreman, where she gives very explicit instructions on colors and once they disappear, he manages the players and says "Have you got this yellow, blue, green White "
