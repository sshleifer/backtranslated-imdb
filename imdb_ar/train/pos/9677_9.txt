The film is on the surface to be a collection of children's films, where parents can sadly see their young children enjoying themselves. The film looks mostly directed at children but does not stop at this level. I first saw this film when I was a little boy and found it funny, fun and intimate and I have not seen it again for years. I have seen her again recently at the age of 18 and found it almost funny but equally fun and exciting. This film is very dismissive and contains many real life messages. This film is the story of an inspiring quest that is designed for children after an epic in itself. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
