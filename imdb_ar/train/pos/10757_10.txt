**Warning! Moderate spoilers! ** Yes, I realized it was hard to spoil a historical documentary, but I uncovered some dramatic background and styles.) <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional documentary not only because of great footage, but Also because of the story behind it. Since Naudets did not begin to tell the story of the events of September 11, but the story of a rising firefighter, the feelings of men and the relationship of the viewer with them more realistic and stronger than in the past retroactively. <br /> <br /> In the sense of making films, "9/11" is a textbook. If events are actual text, they will be fantastic, where the characters are created, and then a curve is thrown that they must interact with. This is more amazing given the pain and passion of raw footage that the filmmakers had to go through to compile this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film presents a glimpse of life inside the fire station; specifically, how the rookie accommodates itself in a crew of veterans. This part alone is very good, and if the documentary is allowed to take its intended path, it is likely to be solid. It seems that the brothers are portraying a realistic process of becoming firefighters in New York City. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell breaks down. The chaos that followed the attacks of the World Trade Center is clearly seen, as the various personalities we have known are moving towards horrific positions. Seeing not only attacks, but also direct reactions is a very moving picture of intense human feelings. <br /> <br /> The consequences, discovered that firefighters have lost and found, are a human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many films, the viewer knows not only who will live and die, but who really cares about it. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that Robert Dinero (whom I liked) was illogical and unnecessary and did not give the story at all. They may have been added only to attract more TV viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: The best documentary I have ever seen. Pictures of human feelings and drama. 9.5 of 10
