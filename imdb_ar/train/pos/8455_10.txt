While I was an impressive young man in the first Gundam Wing series, when I re-watched the series, I reaffirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the design of the characters, the character design and the depth of the character were brilliantly executed. While initially seen as a kind of children's band, the attractiveness of the characters can be partly attributed to exquisite art, where individual characters create a clear and loving distinction between characters. Thus, it is extremely easy to become attracted to any particular personality. Personally, I loved Heero because of his stoic personality. Although I may be biased with a passionate attachment to this offer in my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we get peace?) While providing exciting action battles in a large robot that, At the very least, excellent.
