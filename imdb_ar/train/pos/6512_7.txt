My baby's incubator was a fan, so I saw many of the older episodes as I grew up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why the TV was left on the premiere. To my surprise found it enjoyable. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only two interesting people * evading tomatoes from other lovers * so I would like to focus only on these two. However, this may cause fans to dislike original performances. I love the voice of acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I loved listening to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. Jim Mescimin As Ruby, it seems to me that he really enjoys his role as an actor. I also get a kick from the technicians with their little autistic personalities and their desire to play fortified turrets and dragons or to represent scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show, of course).
