A few years ago, I bought several DVDs that contained two films each. One of them has three girls from Broadway (an alternate title for the Greeks had a word for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a behind-the-scenes comedy that takes place in Scotland and is concerned with the wrong identity of a dancer riding a limousine. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and brilliant, what a leg! Cesar Romero is her producer who takes the opportunity to leave her after the original lead lady because he thinks she belongs to the millionaire who just mentioned his car. David Nevine is that rich man who, when looking for Vera Elaine, is mistaken for a reporter he is supposed to meet but Romero stops. What you have just mentioned may be confusing but (mostly) logical if you are willing to examine your mind while watching this charming comedy with fantastic musical numbers as performed by the wonderful Mrs. Vera Elaine. Romero can be a little overheated here, but Neven gets very excited all the time. The printout I saw was really good given its age and the fact that it was in the public domain. The abundant Elaine works well with her lines because she is not really represented. So in this note, I recommend Happy Go Lovely for the movies that old musical comedy likes.
