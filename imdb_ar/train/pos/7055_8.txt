Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for the sequel I love Jacque and Goss so I did not hesitate. The form of mice writing a book about Cinderella was inspired by that. I enjoy writing the stories myself and hope that the children are encouraged through this. The three stories are nice and entertaining, although the songs were memorable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, Mice Chorus and all the rest. Boom Boom proved the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the ruling. The sequel does the correct change. My rating is 8/10.
