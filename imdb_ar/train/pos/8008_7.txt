To my knowledge, this show was not repeated on UK television after its original show in the late 1960s / early 1970s, and most of the episodes are now "unfortunately missing and presumed." Since 1971, however, still exists fully, I have recently had the opportunity to see everything, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After rushing back home from school, Freewheelers were essential to me and many of them were back in my day in those days Halcion Trousers broke out, Slade and Shikuri tip. Watching it again brought a throat to the throat. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about acting bad, unintentionally fighting scenes, drawing holes wide enough to drive a large yacht that runs across the ocean and "scary, scary" RADA dialects from the main players. <br /> <br /> No - forget it all. Because Freewheelers go back to an old age (dare to say "golden") of children's TV dramas, when the shows were just about annoying fun and did not take themselves seriously. Before they become obsessed with all "ishoos" angry that today's screenwriters are provoking the anger of their young heroes, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, sexually transmitted diseases and so on. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that he was "a new audience" in these days of widespread political correctness, the character of the president will be a black female, a male hero will be a Muslim, the other will be a white boy confused about his sex life will be the girl The game skipped all the action with an IQ beyond the standard, which would forever get players out of the scratches and make them look foolish - in other words, a million miles from the top of Wendy Padbury's Werey-wasle-spraining-washer. <br /> <br /> It's too much of a "show of his time". But is this a bad thing? I do not think so.
