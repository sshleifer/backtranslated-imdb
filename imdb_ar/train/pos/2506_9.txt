Mon Shield was one of the most iconic films I have ever seen. What I really liked was the illustration of immorality / deaths, obstacles and guidance during life. The film depicts a large number of vampires to possess the power and virtues of debauchery. Whether they have miraculous abilities or eternal life, these are the things that people normally desire. Moon Child shows the pain and drawbacks of being immortal, as the feelings of loss affect almost all the characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Moon Child" is revealed as the film draws to a close as it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that lights the way of others, giving direction. I figure like those ethical film portrayed on. The weaknesses of the film are in some parts of the special and influential effects because it made the film less original. The scene in which Toshi's character died could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic feelings were put into acting. Some scenes may have special effects such as more authentic shots without making them look like a moving video game. It seems that the sparks that came out of the weapons are very fake and I think it could have been eliminated or repaired. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should watch. The ideas and avatar images that the movie will be easily accepted by everyone and may be of interest to many viewers. It is a very thoughtful film and also fun to watch.
