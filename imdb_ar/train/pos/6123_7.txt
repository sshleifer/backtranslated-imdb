Before I comment on this film, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I was expecting crap and horror and a traditional B movie and I just wanted to enjoy it. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers, but is actually one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott MacDonald is as wonderful as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in being mentally unstable in great movies if he is not given the chance. MacDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some silly mix of silly elements. Once this snowman starts to move and kill people, you'll find it hard not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny. The fact that the rest of the team members fully add only to the stupidity of the film, but stupidity is a genius. The scene where Snowman is with the teenage girl is really classic in the movie B-movie, a horror film. I really hope there will be a supplement and I'll be there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course, it's just fun watching the first few times and it's not just a good thing for animation technology, but I like to see snowmen kill people. I gave it 7 out of 10, it's a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
