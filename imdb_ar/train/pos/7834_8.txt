Please also see my comment on the first part of Die Nibelungen: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of UFA's epic production of Nibelungen's epic production continues in the emotionally flamboyant and symphonic style of its predecessor. However, while the first part was an emotional portrait of the individual acts of heroism, the second part is a chaotic depiction of the bloodshed on a large scale. <br /> <br /> As in the first part, the director Fritz Lang retains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of motion and the complexity of the composition of the shot going up and down as smoothly as the tone of each scene. You should only see these images with the wonderful Gottfried Huppertz score, which fortunately is found on the Kino DVD. Now, with a focus on teamwork, Lang faces greater challenges in staging. The sequence of motion in its first features has often been poorly constructed, but it now simply makes them part of this rhythmic flow, with the level of activity involved on the screen like the orchestra. <br /> <br /> But as only one part we have made Siegfried's adventures a real and unthreatening issue, the second part presenting war as a devastating tragedy. In both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional communication with the characters. That's why Lange often keeps the camera out of motion and never lets us feel as if we were there (which is important because engaging the audience is often a sign of Lang's work). This is also the reason that the performances play abnormally, as actors walk around like those who sleep with constipation. <br /> <br /> Yet, the revenge of Krimhold always deals with feelings, which is in fact profoundly human. One moment of nature is when Attila holds his infant son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasizes the tenderness of this scene by building it up with a frantic wild ride. The point is that Lang never treats us by our side, and in this regard, this version is shared with the original epic more than Wagner's opera. Atomic slaughter is the antithesis of the dramatic battle scene. Why then did Hitler and Co.. Your eyes are filled with tears, a fact that has dishonored these films unfairly? Because the racist ideology of the Nazis made them view the Nibelungs as good people, even if they killed children and betrayed their relatives. For Hitler, their fall would always be a national tragedy, not a human tragedy. <br /> <br /> But for us, non-Nazi viewers, what makes this photo fun is its beautiful sense of festival and rhythm. When you see these fully developed silent images of Lang, it makes you realize how much was wasted in Hollywood. Instead of being burdened with low-budget steam showers, they should have put him to work on a few of these sword and sandal sealings, images that you should not believe and do not have to move us emotionally, where the poetic tone is the operative tone that sweeps us along.
