One of John's Funniest's movies, Eugene Levy is fantastic in this film as well, I just hope the studio finds out that this should be on DVD, I have a video, but I feel that this movie deserves a DVD (and the additions would be great too) Kung Fu Uuniversity Kung Fu U) Very funny, as with the entire movie, as well as scenes that he has with his wonderful girlfriend and family, this movie does not seem to ever appear on TV, but it loses it so much when it is released for television broadcasting, if you can find the video, I suggest you buy it (the ebay website is a good place to find a copy of it) and I will keep the VHS so we can see it. One day on a DVD. There are a lot of great movies that are not released on DVD, this is one of them.
