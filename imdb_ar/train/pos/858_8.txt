This film contains a rotten nucleus of flexible morality, yet a strange sense of justice. Many of the regular loves among us like to "stick to the man". "MAN" is represented in this case with several different characters. Mr. Keller, to whom Carla reported to her office. Later, Paul owes a great 70 to Mr. Marshand the club owner. Then there is the officer parole Paul. There seems to be a lot of questions about the profile of this last character. Critics point to this as a weakness in the well-crafted ping-pong game between our two champions. The dream is rising for some until their lives change dramatically. They owe to every customer of "MAN". One or both of them could be shot, killed or imprisoned if they did not act as they were told. <br /> <br /> The film finally feels comfortable. Carla finally gets laid. Her boss was forced to come out for being a jerk. Mr. Club owner is a mess of pulp in his bathroom. They get the $ $ money. And ... there is no need to worry about informing the parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to hide his wife wandering in the basement (or anything the police found to arrest him). It's a crucial trigger for my unconscious lock tumbler that has led us to trouble. Do not mind that someone else gets Paul's file later to oversee his release; at this moment they are free! You may get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> Hold on to the man!
