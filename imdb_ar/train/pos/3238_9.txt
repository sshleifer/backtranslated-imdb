The Finnish version of the "short cuts" of Robert Altman, located in the small rural town of Inkowski. The episodes present a scene of eternal events, problems and feelings of human life: joy, love, deceit, disappointment, despair and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a love story for his colleagues at work: she is radiant with the joy of love and life. The other episode shows the elderly man dying in the hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is how old couples should fight against degrading practices at the hospital and their unity is in contrast to the "routine" of the hospital staff (despite signs of casual sympathy). Compared with the classic Altman movie, this film may be less professional, but it is certainly a wonderful piece of art.
