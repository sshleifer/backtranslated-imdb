I agree with the above comment, I like realism in this, and in many movies (not just films about eating disorders) it seems that producers forget about it. They face a problem every day, create a dramatic scene and then come to the end of the film. Everything is fine again, which I do not like because it is not true. Not saying things can not get better, does not mean saying things not in this movie, but it does not spend most of the film on creating all these problems, and comes at the end of the film everything is perfect again. When people suffer from eating disorders, people do not recognize it and want to improve, and then life becomes scared. It takes a while. I like the way we live in this film with the characters. We have difficulties with them, better and worse, because A very important part of the film. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders, shows complications and pain in a very realistic way, and I loved it. I also like how this feeling of secrecy and betrayal appears when suffering from eating disorders. It is frightening to see how people interact when they are discovered, especially if they agree to it. I thought that this film was very moving and beautiful, and I told him well, and bordered by one of my favorites.
