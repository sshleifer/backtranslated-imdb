Greetings back from darkness. The stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary film and provides a glimpse of some of the cruelty of animals living in the wild. For anyone over the age of 40, Disney and Motual of Omaha Wild Kingdom have provided much of our vision for wild animals since our childhood ... when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic, Nature or the Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What is always amazing is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching the elephants circulate for days, almost deadly due to lack of water, is very painful. But their night fight against Black is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots do not breathe. Beautiful humpback Mama and child watching the big white shark attack their prey is all chilling like "jaw". The amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I have never seen such details of the intensity of the range. <br /> <br /> I do not think most young children today will be too excited about this video, but it is certainly one of the most documentaries I have ever taken. I've seen it so far.
