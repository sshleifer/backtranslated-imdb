I just came back from Basic Instinct 2. I went to it thinking it would be crazy on the basis of preview critics and I was very surprised! If you like the original core instinct, I think you will enjoy rank 2 as much if not more. A wonderful story that makes you always wonder and think. The music is wonderful and revives the idea of ​​origin. Do not wait for the Academy Award material, go see it for fun and fun. This is what films are designed for - escape. I can not think of a better way to escape from escaping with Sharon Stone which is as exciting as ever. I'm thinking of going to see her again this weekend. Go see it!
