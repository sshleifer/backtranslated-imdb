For a long time in my life, either I did not like this movie, or I liked this movie but not much more. I've seen it recently (in a sleepy, pleasantly enough) and loved it more than I've done since I was less than 6 years old or anything else. I now appreciate it more, as I do with some other Disney classics I've seen recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or with that spelling). <br /> <br /> I now appreciate animation, turning into a "Disney" smart plot, the humor of rats, the emotions expressed and plot. The animations are done very well, often you seem to be wherever you are and watch other characters. Animations also work well to capture background patterns, including the city (which appears twice briefly). Disney is changing this original fairy tale in an amazingly good way, by injecting intelligent plots, such as clothes-making mice and the main part (I do not usually like Disney movies very much if it's not like the original story but with that, I'm not too upset. With the changes needed to make this Disney film good. I often do not think Disney has changed the book in a good way in some of their films). <br /> <br /> The story is already known, Cinderella is a girl working for her father's wife and her terrible children. She goes to a ball with the help of her imaginary sister and loses a glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you see a lot with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend watching it with friends (and direct family, if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little, people who like fairy tales and people who love mice. Enjoy! :-)
