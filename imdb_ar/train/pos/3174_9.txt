Rarely does one come across an independent comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross is a rare jewel. The director did not only address the challenge of managing his business, but also performed Farhana as a wicked companion in the room. The text casts an interesting look not only at the plight of the stumbling writer, but it blends a lot of comedy into the desolate world of a writer who can only commit to showing me as a character. Very funny things. Despite the small budget that enables Adam Jones to give the film a serious look. It is not manipulated when it comes to making a good film. I can not wait to see what will come next. This guy can make people laugh and think; that's special.
