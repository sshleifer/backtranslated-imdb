It's a wonderful little movie, unique, creative, with some great twists and turns! All the characters are wonderful, and the story while it is quaint and very interesting, in addition to that Nicole Kidman is amazing in this! It's very hard to describe this film, because it's really weird, it's comedian / romantic, after a minute it turns into a thriller, but it was still very fun, plus Nicole's Russian accent was fantastic, and very convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and I loved the performance of Vincent Castle! , In addition to some plot transitions that really surprised me! The finish was very nice and unpredictable all the time! , And that this film is also less appreciated !. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way I was fooled, I think all the characters were very loved, in addition to that the end is very good. This is Nicole's film though, and she carries it with her impressive performance! It's a wonderful little movie, unique, very imaginative, with some great twists and turns! , I highly recommend this! The trend is very good! Jez Butterworth does a very good job here, with wonderful work for the camera and solid angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace! Great acting! Nicole Kidman, Incredibly Fantastic! , Was amazing. (Kidman rules !!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he's very lovable, he had a great personality, and he had a very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing I did not like was to get his anger out of Kidman, even though what I did was wrong I loved how he got revenge in the end! Vincent Castell is as wonderful as the main villain, yes he has been OTT, but he was very dense and sometimes very creepy, and this role was perfect for him. Matthew Kasowitz was fine here, but did not have much to do. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 of 5
