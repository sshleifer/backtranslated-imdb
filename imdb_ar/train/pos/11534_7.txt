Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror film / film since 1990, released here in the UK under the title "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It is a horror film based on the desert about a group of young friends who are partying on the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force driving a black truck threat! This movie contains some creepy scenes, some juggling here and there, but I must say that the acting was very lame, even by low budget standards! But the film was strangely addictive and I loved it, never drowned or closed it, which is always a good sign! We were given this film almost 6/10, but I saw when vapor was accumulating all the way, there were some good moments of confusion and suspense, it had some nudity, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was very hotty! I will give it 7/10.
