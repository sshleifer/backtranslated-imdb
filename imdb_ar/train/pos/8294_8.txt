This movie has great combat scenes. Now it's true that the representation is a bit rough. But if you want to watch a movie based on acting skills, I will watch a chis√© like American Beauty. But if you want to watch a movie with real martial arts in it and with amazing games without the use of wires and flying, it threw the air like many of the existing movies that ended with killing the matrix. Then watch this. Now it is true that the two main stars in the show, where the child shows power rattles and another member of the actor in this show has a small part in this film. But the fighting scenes are enough to make my jet pants. The stunts are worth enough for Jackie Chan to sit down and admire.
