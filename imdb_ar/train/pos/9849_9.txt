When I saw the trailers, I saw the film. When I had it, I felt a kind of dissatisfaction. It was a wonderful film, do not miss me, but I think the wonderful parts are already in the trailers, if you sit next to me. Things went on quickly, so I did not feel bored at all, and I enjoyed watching them. The humor was so wonderful. First contact me with Laziness (..or such a thing).
