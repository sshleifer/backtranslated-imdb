This is just another example of the absolute genius of Jane Wilder. He has written and participated in this wonderful mystery. No one can do it better. The suspense was clear all the time. I hope that Mr. Wilder will honor us with one of these. I enjoyed everything I saw in Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how true his talent was until I saw "Murder in a Small Town", and this follow-up. He really has a strong understanding of what the public wants and how to communicate it in his writings, and of course in his wonderful behavior. His wit comes through the spades. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves puzzles and / or the work of Jane Wilder. Its star becomes brighter and brighter.
