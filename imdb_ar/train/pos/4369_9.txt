I loved this film scene was breathtaking, and the scheme had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, Rob Roy scored much higher than average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" film in which the quality of the dialogue was very high. There were many pieces and a verbal pronunciation to accompany the duel fencing brilliantly. I can give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Second, understanding this film principle is rarely recognized anymore. In order for the drama to succeed, it does not just need a hero, it needs a really believable villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in rooting good. And "Rob Roy" has not one, but three - Earl Montrose, and his followers Keelern, Archie. No bad guys are one-dimensional, either, but the flesh is quite and very bad. It takes more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue, the accents are a bit tricky, but they are smarter than paper. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
