My favorite police series of all time turns into a TV movie. Is he working? Yes really. Ji works for mayor and gets shot. Murder "Hall of Fame" appear. Pembleton and almost all the policemen who played in the series. Many memories of the past help you not watch the TV series, but it also entertains the fans. The last five minutes solve another murder and eventually bring up two dead policemen. The short appearance of the favorite death judge Juliana Cox. This is a good film
