How can the viewer be evaluated for this movie just 5.4?! Only the beautiful young man Alisan Porter should start automatically at the age of 6 when you decide your rating. James Belushi is good at this as well, his first good hard course, I did not like anything about About Last Night. It was good in a gang associated with Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you love her. OK I will. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> Curly Sue was given 7
