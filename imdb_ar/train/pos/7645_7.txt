Belushi in his most enticing and Courtney Cox before friends has a small role. I often think that Belushi is being used poorly in Hollywood and this cinematic role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and loved character. The film itself is not a wreck of the earth, and the message is not new but sweet and beloved. The support group for familiar faces and unfamiliar names is an ideal balance even though the songs of Lefitz can wear out, and Michael Kane's charming spiritual guide has a slightly evil edge, if not a good one. Hamilton, as a wife of Belushi unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Rene Russo is lost and not terribly convinced by the "concert queen" who fled. However, a nice way to spend two hours.
