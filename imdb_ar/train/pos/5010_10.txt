Streisand fans who are only familiar with FUNNY GIRL and beyond should watch this show to see what Streisand WAS has done - before achieving its goal of becoming a movie star. There was never a singer like her before, and there will never be again (sorry, Celine - just in your dreams!), But again Strisand will not sing with vitality, energy and, above all, the enthusiasm and weakness she plays here - When she came to Central Park in two or three years, FUNNY GIRL was Hollywood and her style of performance was less spontaneous and more conservative (and more, let's face it: more angry) - there's a wall between her and the audience. The live performance was never what I really enjoyed - I did it because she knew she was reminding her to Hollywood, and once she no longer had to do it, she did it as little as possible (and oh, that legendary stage provides such a good excuse! ). <br /> <br /> Her singing here and her former appearance Judy Garland's show is unbelievable: Streisand can make a really old song again, and authors like Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlene loved her. But by the 1960s Streisand was trying to be a rock singer, her albums roaming the younger audiences, with an exaggerated scream of songs that did not deserve her voice or effort. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s she came back with the wonderful Broadway album, but it continued, what about the struggle to do it, how to "tell her" not to do it, etc. Please - When did someone tell Streisand and what to do? She could do good things like this all the time, raising the crowd to its level rather than bending to what she thought the young crowd wanted. (Coming back to Broadway was not nearly as good as it seems that Streisand feels it is necessary to improve the work of the other composers: if he survives at that time, will Richard Rodgers recognize his film "A Charming Evening?" Rodgers, infamous To take the singers on a mission to play with his music, was undoubtedly after Strisand to sing what he wrote! It also blows Michael Crawford on the CD in the "Night Music" duet - it seems to remind him only of his CD Why do you insist on taking the songs of Dewa and singing them herself, And songs that are not Diot and sing like a duet with another person turn to diminish?) </ Br> <br /> Satisfied that Judy Garland took Strisand aside and advised her, "Do not let them do what they did to me," Streisand's advice did not waste time in attention - despite her protests on the contrary, it certainly seems to have always been her way or the highway. CBS How its first TV ad will be implemented - not guests, just HER. <br /> <br /> But no one can argue with the obvious results here. "Explain yourself to this wonderful musical phenomenon before it is a myth - you will be quite surprised! <br /> <br /> PS - I saw this again last night (12/01) after not seeing it for many years - it was even better than I remembered! The first chapter begins with "I'm late" and includes "Be Honest", "How to Taste the Wine" and Barbara's Childhood Award, "I'm Five" - ​​it reaches its climax when Streisand shows the whole song "People" Bored of the song yet and with it a somewhat shorter process, it is compared with some copies of "automatic pilot". Chapter 2 (after the Kooky series, which has not changed much over the years) is the famous series of songs of depression that have been put in the midst of Bergdorf-Goodman's extravagance. <br /> <br /> The 3rd Act is stunning - it's called "Streisand, Orchestra, and the Public" (although we do not see the audience that is witnessing this historic event at all). With her fear of the masses and hatred of this performance, this may have been the hardest part for her, but if so, it did not appear. "Lover Come Back to Me" and the "When the sun comes out" (though I can not remember in the order!), "Why did I choose you?" (One of my favorite Streisand shows) and offers a variety of FUNNY GIRL , Including (of course) "Do not Rain for My Clients" and my favorite song of the score, "The Music That Makes Me Dance." A song like that in 1922, made it Broadway toast, "then Strisand sings" My Man " Her dress was in a later display of a screen in FUNNY GIRL (the main difference is that the black dress here is sleeveless - her film had a long sleeves and black background, all we saw was Her hands and face), but the sound here is more urgent than her subsequent voice in the film. A relationship with Streisand has nothing to do with Fanny Price who, of course, has never sung the song here as in Streisand here or in the film - see The GREAT ZIEGFIELD for a glimpse of the most important pric version.) The show ends with Streisand sings "Happy Days Are Here Again "On credits. <br /> <br /> I ended up with the friend I was watching: "You've never done anything better!" <br /> <br /> She was 20 years old!
