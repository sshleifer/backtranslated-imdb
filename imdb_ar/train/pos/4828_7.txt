Rupert Friend offers, like Prince Albert, "The Young Victoria" to unexpected heights. It is a nice. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark and deep depression after the death of Prince Albert and looked into Ruper Friend's eyes that she understood. The film does not take us to his death, but to an incident that may have cost his life. The act of love. I have trusted him, or I must tell him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anyone gets anywhere near the sensitivity and depth of a friend's profile. Emily Blunt was good but I could not believe for a minute she was Victoria. There is no real meaning to this period. It may not be her fault but her prince deserves the crown.
