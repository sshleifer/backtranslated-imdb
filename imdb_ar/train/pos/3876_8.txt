The beautiful Danish actress Sonia Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone, and there is no small work given the wonderful performances surrounding it. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, unemployed and somewhat independent of the nervous (and perhaps suicidal) actress who descends into a desperate job of caring for an elderly wheelchair-bound father named Valentin (the great Danish actress Fritz Helmuth, Who died 77 years after the production of this film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Valentin refuses to respond to anyone - <br /> <br /> The writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty faced by the son of the huge businessman (Jurgen, played by Klausen) with the father who never accepted him. The film swings in the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how one person, the indestructible, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. Sonia Richter's performance alone deserves the price of admission.
