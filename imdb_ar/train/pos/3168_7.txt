This is a small and sad story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who escaped to California to escape a failed relationship in Japan. Kane is a Japanese-American hand-working agent with a rock-and-roll look but little cement to offer a potential partner. Kyoko Kane is married in order to be able to stay permanently in the United States, on the grounds that although they will live together until she gets a "green card", the marriage will be by name only. It quickly evolved that the parties were not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the "time zone" itself, hence the title of the film. As an immigration lawyer, I have seen such "arrangements" take their own lives, so I was pleased to see how the director was developing the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
