Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies, like this. Most friends just watch movies from the '90s until the present. That kinda stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are unique masterpieces in their own way. Just because when these films were thought and made, it was when the ideas were new. Now people are just trying to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. For real lovers of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator investigating the disappearance of a film actor, and finds three other bizarre events with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anymore, because I will spoil the film more than I already have. But he is a wonderful film of his age as it is. I would not mind watching it again!
