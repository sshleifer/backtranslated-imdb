I remember this show from Swedish TV. I was only 7 years old, and this was incredibly frightening. <br /> <br /> I would like to review this series and see if it is as fantastic as I remember although I doubt my tastes and demands have changed. Although this has been produced by the alien and many other space novels, I think it has its roots in scary films from the 1950s: the political climate of the 1970s. When I think about it, it was a real science fiction, a film that tries to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. Since then science fiction has become a dark term and has become the term for any film containing spacecraft.
