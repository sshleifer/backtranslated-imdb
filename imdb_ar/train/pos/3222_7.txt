The first two episodes of this film have prepared the two conflicts: the conflict - objective - between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and material conflict - between Tod and his replacement of geometric engineering. Both sequences are controlled in different ways. <br /> <br /> The people's scenario is somewhat staggered by solving the first of these brackets halfway through the film, which means that the second half is more than just a simple action. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, manufacturers are praised for inventing a piece of musical genre with a heart and even a little soul, especially for Kurt Russell, who moves a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's worth watching.
