Here's one you'll enjoy the whole family ... even those who consider themselves older than fairy tales. Shelley Duval has overcome this unique and imaginative idea of ​​all the common fairy tales about childhood. The scripts offer new ups and downs about the old myths we grew up with a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to the Duval standard, which in my opinion is one of the best five series, highlighted by Jennifer Bells (reminiscent of "Flashdance" - and still in Hollywood producing a film here and there) in the role of the title, and Jean Stapleton the role of mythical godmother in Southern dialect and Eve model as a model To experience the evil wife of the father. Eddie McClurg ("Feiris Beller's Day") and Jane Alden make the funny duo as parents. Matthew Broderick is the gentle Prince Henry. You have to keep going back to this one!
