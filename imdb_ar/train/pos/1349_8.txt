RKO is best known for its production of popular Americana films. <br /> <br /> Ann Shirley (like Dawn O'Day) has been in movies since she was a little girl. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played the role of Anne Defoirek as a child in "Three in a Match" (1932) and "Flower Girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. George Nichols Jenner remembered Ann's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. Ann Shirley also adopted her theatrical name. There are memorable stories - Lady Shalott in a leaking boat, a "stolen" brooch, and a "red hair" incident. Anne was well suited to the orphan orphan's orphan role. It was tragic in its intensity, its satisfaction and its fiery temperament. O.P. Heggie was fantastic where Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley were just as good as Marilla. Tom Brown was Gilbert Blyth excellent. Gertrude Messinger, who was in the movies of a little girl, was as good as Diana Barry. Sarah Hadin proved she could play the role of someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, and Ms. Barry was.
