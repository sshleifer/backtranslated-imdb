Two years ago I watched the movie "El Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything about this film. It is clear that I was under the full impression of the wonderful role of Pierce Brosnan. Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV so I looked it a bit deeper. Now, I can say with certainty that this film is not special but you just have to love it because of one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises his rating to the top in my opinion through the stunning performance of Julianne Noble, a hard-working man who has no friends. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, the lucky man: his son died in an accident, his job is not going well, and he is not sure he can keep his wife between Hop Davis. <br /> <br /> You've always loved movies like this; crime film with a great touch of humor. "I look like a whore in Bangkok on a Sunday morning after leaving the sea town," said Brosnan, who tells jokes about the pygmies with great sensations. Brosnan says that with his charm while he drinks Margarita as usual. I also love Greg "a typical American face" Kinnear in the role of the loser made very dynamically because there are so many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend you see the best possible role for Brosnan ever. It will make you smile and admire it at the same time. The great Brosnan film is not as much.
