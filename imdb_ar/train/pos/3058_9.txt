I bought this a year ago or more for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), left it on the shelf for ages, and now watch DVDs while hiding with a cold. <br /> <br /> This is an annoying movie. Great offers from all involved, especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). <br /> <br /> Pluto reminds me of maybe my favorite movie of all time, Gross Point Blanc, but obviously this is grainy, heavy-hearted. <br /> <br /> As a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist and forensic medicine, the spine trembled when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary things! Great work throughout the tour. <br /> <br /> House
