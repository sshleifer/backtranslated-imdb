This movie made me cry in the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen a lot of great movies, and even more crap. But when I finished the scene - Cathar in his heart - I cried! And if you do not - you have serious problems! The story is typical - nothing new or original. But it is true - because this kind of thing has already happened and people are already there. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they went through in the early seventies ... At some point, I was directed to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas are never really very good. But this film made us believe in all this ... because they are not trying to make it a path filled with glorious concerts, featuring superheroes, stupid group girls and emotional drugs, who do not glorify drugs and alcohol. They promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes 20 years late. Once again a wonderful movie. Since Leaving Las Vegas I never moved to a movie.
