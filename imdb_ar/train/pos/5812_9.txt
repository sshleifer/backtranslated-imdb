Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you are not a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and I enjoyed most of the film, and the ending was not great, but the first 50 minutes or so were - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that the first 50 minutes are re-viewed several times. Dance in each video is impressive, wonderful music to listen to the dialogue and amusing. <br /> <br /> Includes many of his best videos from Bad and snippets from previous videos. Also includes some live concert footage. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must, if you are not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, rest completely. <br /> <br /> 9/10
