Sleep migrants are objects that drain the life force of humans completely to survive ... but they can only use virgins (this is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krauss) is the one who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice Craig). He goes after the beloved Tania (Amchen Madchen). Will you run away? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a terrifying horror film. Fast paced, a lot of blood and humor and a nice, twisted feeling. There are a lot of references in the humor of amateur horror (Little Rock Castle once). Also an excellent Krause (which he thought he could act after "back to the Blue Lagoon") as is Kirge and Amick. But I find this movie disturbing. <br /> <br /> Written by Steven King of the screen is very mysterious. Never fully explain sleeping. from where they are? Why do they call it? Why should the Son feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What is their power after all (at one point, Kraus make the car disappear and change color and elegance!)? Why do they need to feed the life force of people? Why should only virgins be? Why does a son practice sex with his mother? None of these is explained leaving the story confusing. It's very bad because, aside from these questions, this is an excellent horror film. Excellent makeup and special effects also. <br /> <br /> Fast, durable, and a lot of fun. If the scenario is only better. A fairly obvious sexual scene was also released between Krause and Krige (you can say) to get a R rating. I can only give this 7.
