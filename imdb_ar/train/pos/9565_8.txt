Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but do not worry, the picture is a terrible shot), can be described as the best person in Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays the role of a Cambodian killer in the city to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty from his trip, he sits almost immediately at a huge table in the middle of an expensive restaurant. If this sounds unbelievable to a large extent, you are likely to avoid this movie. It was a suspension of disbelief, and I had a lot of fun for it. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), an ardent young policeman who likes to beat people around him as much as he likes to smoke. Wai follows a fine line in which he investigates internal affairs in his investigation, and his father, the legendary Good Cop, is in a coma after a drug deal went south (meaning that Wai leaves his father taking rap because of his own corrupt dealings). <br /> <br /> There are car crashes, lots of killings, and a strange and puzzling love story presented here, all of which are played in almost comic style. I think humor was deliberate (no one uses massive concrete structures without being duped by absurd absurdity), although supernatural has lost a number of my colleagues. There are at least three points where the film is likely to have ended, and in 109 minutes, it may have benefited from more harsh editing, or the deletion of a narrative message chain (the lighthearted things worked well, so I would rule out interactions with the three parents). <br /> <br /> I tend to give it a pass (high), but if it is because of the end only? I rarely heard many people laugh out loud while it should have been a painful moment. This is the one to see with a group of friends who love fucking
