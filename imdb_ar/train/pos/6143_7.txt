You've never seen a 1971 movie, and I've enjoyed this wonderful production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lanspiere played a prominent role as a woman who had studied a course in witchcraft and was an apprentice who began to fly on a broomstick and had some difficulties in taking off. Eglantin discovered many tricks and managed to travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to become an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this session in magic and tries to help her in every way possible to solve it. Eglantine has a goal of her crime: to prevent the Nazis from evading England. Wonderful family entertainment and we need more movies like this day.
