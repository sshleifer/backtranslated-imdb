Worth seeing, especially with the kind gentleness of a journalist honestly, you expect a whole lot of story stories because Gray Owl is not exposed as a fraud, but it is not and adds to the subject and the optimistic and thrilling drama in general the story and the film. <br /> <br /> This should be the best performance for Brusnan so far, and he is admirably convinced that he is an English boy who plays Indians. The scene stands out is back to his own? Aunts? Mrs. Brosnan and the old lady make a wonderful scene filled with nostalgia for life and a lost life through little dialogue, only with good words and direction. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The story is very well known and the message is very universal, and the important thing is that it is unfortunate that this film did not get a better recognition, and perhaps in time it might become somewhat classic and sleeper. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done by Dickie Attenborough and thrown.
