2005 Toronto Film Festival Official Report. "Takashi Miike" was destroyed. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight show of the new "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War", "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want, it's a fanatical journey. <br /> <br /> Colin Judis, the fearless programmer, said the film was originally directed at children in Japan. Think of the "Lord of the Rings" or the "Neverending Story" of Japan. After the examination, I can understand where they are going for it, but this is "Mickey Takashi" after all. Directed the film '01' Ichi the Killer, when it was screened in festival festival bags that were distributed in the show. No, this was not just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The little boy who lives a troubled, "chosen" life becomes stumbling in the middle of the Great Spirit War, meeting a host of friendly spirits that became his companions during his journey. <br /> <br /> This is not really children, nor is it young. Surely they see them feeling scared of some of these spirits (even friendly). This is not like anything I've seen in a movie theater before. The fantasy of course, some material is very funny (but dark). You will not feel bored that can guarantee that. Will this strike North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My classification = b
