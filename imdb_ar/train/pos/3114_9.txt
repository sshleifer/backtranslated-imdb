I'm going to keep this fairly short so do not spoil anything for you. This movie is awesome. From start to finish, full of real excitement. The fighting scenes are fascinating, the witch hunt scenes are so fast moving that they feel slow in the end only when things are explained, but this is only due to all the above. Damon shines, and has really proved to be a very strong actor, who dares not believe him in this role. It is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (I hope I have mentioned it close to the right) as an unnatural CIA agent to kill Bourne. This non-stop will really leave you at the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things in the end are just smidgeon useless, thus negating classification 10. The open end is left to the tailors and I hope they think of doing more of these things, because none of them was not bad. Excellent movie in all and a wonderful ending for a stunning trio. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaky camera did not hurt any of the events, but I still think we can do without them. The good news is that you really noticed it when people talk and not that much.
