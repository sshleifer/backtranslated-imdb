Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is involved in a deadly crime without knowing it at first, and dominoes add to the risk, adventure and misdeeds of the poor American West in the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes funny, and Cage pulls the mix through its usual wit and ease of use. <br /> <br /> Is the conspiracy above the top? Yes really. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy and beloved killer? Yes really. Does the cage stand a chance? Well, you have to see and see. Never leave, and it surprised me for the first time I saw it. In the second observation yesterday, I was surprised by how stable it was, how well it was built, how awful and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dale (who also helped write) is more known for his television work, but with the Rounders this film shows an ingenious hand with intriguing plots. It is saved by its humor by the way, and by caricatures. The tape is flabby, the police questionable. Do not miss out on a veil inspired by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
