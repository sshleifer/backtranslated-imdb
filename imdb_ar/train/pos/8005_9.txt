I bought this game on eBay after I heard it was a game similar to Elite. This game is actually very similar, very addictive. As soon as I played it several times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so that they could join the fun too .... I played this game correctly and told the story makes it feel like if you are already in a movie, it is awesome. If you are having trouble exploring because of the restrictive nature of the story line in the individual player game, you just set up a Freelancer server on your computer (easy to do and the program is included) and play on your heart content. There are still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so the multi-player problem is not a problem that does not threaten them too much, because you do not often mean other players unless you want to. So, go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the individual player's campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is spectacular, with huge systems to explore and wreck to find, as well as all kinds of other things to discover - hidden planets, heavy holes, secret rules, endless menu and endless gameplay especially because you can get them for an extra charge on EBay. Get one with a full written guide if you can (blue box, not red box Xplosiv), it is better loads!
