I have seen a lot of science fiction from the seventies; some bad too bad, others thought provoking and really scary. Suylent Green fits the last category. Yes, it is sometimes a small camp, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some movies seem to be very old. Here we have a film, 9 years before the Blade Runner, dare to imagine the future as dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charleston and Edward J. Robinson is better off than the Ten Commandments, and the suicide scene with the help of Robinson is the captain of Ziv for Kevorkian and his ilk. Some situations are old (can you imagine a film director with the concept of "women as furniture" in the 1990s, but it is rare to find a movie of "I contract" that can actually make you think.) This is something I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a presentation Broad, I do not think the whole range of this movie will get paid.
