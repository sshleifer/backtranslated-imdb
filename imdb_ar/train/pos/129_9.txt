With stunning cinematography and a string of Kafkaesque stupidity, this film made me a simple and wonderful opening scene. The film is like a dream, and I think that may be why people hate or love it. The characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is light and perhaps useless. But these are film failures, but they are conscious choices. The film does not try to act as a history; it is a disassembly of war films in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to say that there was a real real content for the film, but the movie was a film wonder that I had been completely washed away. This is one of the most beautiful films ever filmed, and there is a tremendous imagination in his style. I can fully understand why people hate it, but I give it 9/10.
