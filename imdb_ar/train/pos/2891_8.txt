We saw this on the Disney World on ABC last night and came to the conclusion that things had to be tougher in the "mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this movie only works for 74 minutes, and they had to broadcast it for two hours from the time of the broadcast, they have, and I do not, commercial breaks lasting 6 to 7 minutes. During these commercial breaks, they had another ad under the guise of a "TV show" hosted by the annoying Kelly Riba who loudly announced the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True." <br /> <br /> Again and again, after a break, Disney took a long time in the real movie to tell us, faithful viewers, that we need to get a copy of the film. Thank you, Disney, for our service of creating a complement to your favorite film theme. <br /> <br /> In any case, all of these businesses are ringing the cash register making it difficult to access the actual movie "Cinderella", because by the time the commercials ended, I had forgotten where the story had stopped. <br /> <br /> Of course, the original Cinderella still retains its charm, the story is still good, although we have seen it all countless times. It's a shame that they had to cut it down with all the marketing of what seems to be a lame follow-up.
