Zentropa is the most famous film I've seen in years. If you like the unique thrill movies that are affected by Noir, this is just the right treatment for all the Hollywood movies that are filling the theaters these days. Von Trier's rebounds, like Breaking the Waves, got a lot of praise, but that's really the best job he has. It is delightful without distracting you and provides the perfect blend of thrill and dark humor. It is very bad that he decided that portable cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who spoke to him away from the way he is presented here, but the loss of all is that he entered his theoretical dogma strongly.
