Do not listen to the novice critics who may still feel bitterness about the grilled Silverman who gave them at the Spike TV Awards for video games a few months ago. Sarah Silverman is curious, amazing, surreal, immature and silly and fits fairly well into the adult swimming pool. If Silverman shakes "moody" jokes of events and asserts that the narrower and strangest hidden color is still the allusion to now, we may have one of the greatest comedy comedies since "strangers with candy" has been abolished. But only from watching the pilot, a mysterious musical / musical solid, unremarkable, but with enormous potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a delightful and personal child - the most beautiful and American version of the late great princess Jerry Blanc. One of the most unusual and non-stereotypical images of a gay couple I have seen on television is shown at the exhibition. Early reviews indicate that the next few episodes outperform the beta, so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds.
