In the history of movies based on comic books, "masked men" is one of the most deprecated books. This is not a regular supernatural comedy! The result is the work of a diverse team of good wills, including Mr. Vorius (played by Ben Stiller), Paul (Janine Jarvalho), Schweiler (William H. Messi), and the blue (Hank Azaria) spleen (Paul Rubens). The "mysterious man" deceives many aspects of super hero films such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as colossal words, questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with a meager jobs and a nervous home life. So director Kenka Oscher seems to be making heroes into something that ordinary viewers can relate to. I found that "masked men" are visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a privilege, we are still pleased to see it!
