Given the nature and origin of the 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its attitude toward America. Probably the most "hostile" part of Ken Loach who certainly does not pull the new British Labor Party line. Although the events that took place a year ago are appalling and painful to most Americans and most of the spectators who have seen them unfold live on CNN and elsewhere, most writers and directors choose to show that the tragedy is not exclusively American. Anyone should be surprised that these three thousand deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the West gives them to thousands of Tutsis, Tamils, Bosnians, Chileans and Kurds (we need to move forward). If this is an invitation to "wake up" to the states, it is just as tragic that the Israeli / Palestinian impasse in the next 12 months is far from resolved while George W. Bush. Revenge is preferable to making the world a safer place. I think many contributors wonder where idealism has gone for founding fathers, and why America, symbolically created as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance, now has its own self-interest as the third world wonders where the next drink, meal or bullet is coming from.
