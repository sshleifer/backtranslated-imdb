Life in (some) colleges. Of course, technical licenses were obtained, but some of what I have seen in this film continues in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to the colleges in Southern California where they race with their races. It's funny because these schools want ethnic unity, equality, etc. I can honestly say they exist. But the thing is when the chapter comes out, or when they go out just waiting for separation, they (students) seem to be walking with people of their race or race. Is that bad? Not right. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended, I once wrote about it, "We should all try to get around with students from other ethnicities and try to identify them." Otherwise you are creating your chapter. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly exists in one of the schools to which I have joined. On one occasion, someone posted pamphlets on the campus talking about the glories of the Aryan race and he carried symbols of some of these racist organizations. Luckily, nothing happened like the incident in the film where the young Caucasian set out and began shooting at a multicultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this ever happens. <br /> <br /> Is "higher education" very dramatic? Exaggerated? Can. Is it the way "out of the mark?" This depends on where you went or go to school. The ethnic thing happens where ethnicities only go around doing it. Minus exaggeration in Hollywood, something racing is very close to home for me.
