This conditional action is not worse than many others in his time and better than little. He clearly follows the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but he appears as a fun programmer. The best of it is the unadorned appearance of a world long gone ... the lower class of New York in the late 1940s / early 1950s. Here in all its extraordinary glory, from old school tattoo shops to cheap hotels to fatty spoons. These old police movies are like old-fashioned and sweet-time trips to anyone who hates the view of the sterile city and the restaurant today. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to focus on the scientific side of the nuts and bolts in the crime solution ... In this case, a tattooed woman was killed and found in an abandoned car. Our main protagonists, informants Tobin and Corrigan, are doing the work, but without the strenuous efforts of Lab Children, they will not go anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use the inconsistent stability of the CSC. An investigator to track their man. <br /> <br /> The way some reviewers wrote about this film, you think it could be directed by Ed Wood and acting with additions from his films. What a bush! I enjoyed John Miles as a former Marine supervisor who became a Tobin policeman ... He had a happy and easy approach to the role, which is a welcome change from the usual stone-faced tronions of most film men of the period. Patricia Barry is as nice and delicious as his cheerful girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is suffocating and fun like the older investigator Corrigan. I liked the chemistry of these two types and made something a little different from the "Dragnet" type robotic. <br /> <br /> The puzzle itself is not too deep and the ultimate chase and shooting certainly will not rank among the crime scene classics, but during a short run, "The Tattooed Stranger" is more of my interest.
