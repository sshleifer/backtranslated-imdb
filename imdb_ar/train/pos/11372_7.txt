The film "The Citizen X" tells the story of "Rostov's Butcher", the title of the murderer of a vicious and murderous Russian series that killed 52 people from 1978 to 1992. The film focuses on the novice detective Rea, who followed the murderer with care in the face of the uncooperative bureaucracy Self-service and comfort denial. HBO offers great TV shows, great shows, and a lot of shocking detail, but it plays like Hollywood's Hollywood-style documentaries. The drama is equal and direct to a serious and relatively unknown story more interesting than Jack the Ripper. (B)
