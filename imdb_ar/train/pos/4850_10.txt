If Piers is absent from sleep? Wife visits mother in law? You're still at home. It's a dark and stormy night and there's no football on the shortcut and the dishwasher needs to stack up? Now what will you do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old Kakawa (Frys is the best!) Keep some nuts and ginger and sit in front of the DVD. Go Now Choose and play Arthur Askeys in World War II, The Ghost Train, back to this comfortable bed and enjoy a night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is an authentic classic British war game! Arthur Asquay from his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, enjoys you, I suspect the actors, in high octane, excitement and spills, spy film. It is located in the old English countryside during World War II. <br /> <br /> It is centered around a variety of people who need to stay overnight, through conditions beyond the control of any of them, in an old railway waiting room that they discover the old train is chasing. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds precisely and precisely is credited throughout the cast in humorous parts and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story of the old boy Godfrey of Dads Army is famous and clever) <br /> <br /> Arthur Asky is fun and at home he makes his routines for you and the cast, and also shows that he can act Little! The crew were not shown at all, so that the rail carrier and the parrot help to give the film the necessary gravity. <br /> <br /> Oh, when it finishes please remember to stack the dishwasher!
