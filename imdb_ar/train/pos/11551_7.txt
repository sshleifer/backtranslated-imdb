Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the ultimate "Odd Couple". Their amazing work on the TV series from the early to mid-1970s was a hallmark of television at the time ... easily outperforming the theater and screen versions of the story. However, how can you err in pairing Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is in particularly good condition like Oscar, slob. Lemmon takes some getting used to Felix, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's previously outstanding performance. The script is good ... definitely the best Neil Simon. (I will record here to say that Neil Simon may be one of the worst dramatists in American theater). The story is simple: Felix, a neat and newly separated freak for his wife moves with an Oscar, a slob who needs some help saving money to pay for the maintenance. Their lives were arranged like marriage, too, culminating in some amusing feuds. Lots of fun and some hardcore one.
