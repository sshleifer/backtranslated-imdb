Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls struggling on their way to the world of love and sex. This story is listed at a slow pace and works very well. It provides ample time and space to identify and stick to the various characters. <br /> <br /> Using a small team will put pressure on people who play because they all have more screen time than normal, but the people who play in this movie do it well. Everyone is quite reasonable. The visual setup is great, especially the underwater shots at the pool add a great influence. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been created around the same theme, although this film does not really stand out over any of them. It pulls out some "standard" pressure methods from the high hat and works on them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's certainly not too good, and I feel it would have been better if I had absorbed some less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
