This is one of those movies that I still think about when you wake up the next morning. This will give you a warm and mysterious feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Certainly, we will be fed on typical characters and typical stories, but they do the trick: Entertainment /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the US for some time, it's funny how we reacted. "The deadly husband will kill him", "You will die (Gabriela) and there will be a more tragic end of life." We know how these things work, everything comes in the end. And I did. The characters were fairly simple, so complex that you did not think twice about it, and there was nothing real left to your imagination. Probably the closest is Siv, they make you ask yourself if she really likes Daniel, but that's about him. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful, filmed in the countryside of Norland, very wonderful music and lovable characters. Michael Nyqvist is really a genius, with a unique and crazy look and unique charming charming Hallberg. Probably very nice. <br /> <br /> But most of all that this movie makes you feel, this is the most important thing. You cry, laugh, hate and identify yourself. I do not know about you guys, but that does not happen very often.
