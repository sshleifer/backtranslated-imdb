I admire all of the actors / singers especially Gackt, and when I first discovered this movie and watched the trailer, I think this is a fucking film. After a long waiting period, I finally saw him and here is my comment .. <br /> <br /> I take it that everyone knows the story of the story and I will not mention it, instead the first applause applauds me, generally that the Japanese films did not shine and act. Geekt reflects his emotions and changes well. I like many of his dramatic and humorous scenes, as is the case with the HYDE part, he is a good actor but he deliberately stays in the background as an actor, as his character does, throughout the film. I did not like some cinematography especially the lighting and some colors but because of the small budget, it still has wonderful moments, but the real movie gem is a story. He has some cheesy moments but everything is okay for me, and the subject of friendship in the film is really sophisticated and touching at times, on the other hand, the story refers to a harsh world that no one is guaranteed, and with some memorable death scenes that reflect this subject to the visuals. Besides the interesting observation, this film contains some similarities with an excellent vampire film Interwiew with a vampire who also plays the most beautiful (not handsome, beautiful) actors in American cinema, in fact Moon Child can be seen somehow as Brothers of Interwiew, but Original alone. The only problem is that MoonChild is slow sometimes, I like watching a Japanese movie and I'm used to it, but that does not change. MoonChild contains some scenes or characters that are useless. But all in all; this film is very good and sometimes very emotional, as for actors / singers I wish to watch their other movies in the future, and I recommend this to anyone who loves vampire movies, action and romance 8/10
