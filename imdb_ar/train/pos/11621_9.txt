I was bored one night and Red Eye was busy and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean I just entered the reason why it was so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also features two spectacular performances in the film with Rachel McAdams as Lisa Resert and Kylian Murphy as Jackson Ribbner. <br /> <br /> The acting is just wonderful and you will feel the feelings of the people in the film. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent, it gives you a chill and can make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I like the way the film was made and it does not get boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is just a phenomenon. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoy the red eyes so much that I can see them again and again. <br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie
