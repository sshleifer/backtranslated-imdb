I do not mind every walk. People really walk walking at the time. I have lent an air of originality to this period of time and some views on Mars technology. I was also disappointed by the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most exciting events in the book. But I can not praise this film enough, for his devotion to the story of Wells! It's about time. The actors are lovable and the performances charming. It is also worth watching to hear the truly wonderful musical result of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the actor himself playing both the writer and his brother in London.
