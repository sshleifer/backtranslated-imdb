Well, I've seen this in the theaters when I came out and do not know why. I have not seen her since, but I finished this page because I found myself thinking about this film - again I do not know why. But the fact that I remember talking volumes. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult - much harder than any drama. Doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, watch out, you enter this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie admiringly. This was done at a rapid pace, with a tongue in the cheek and knowing it was not the story of Philedelphia, it is amusing from beginning to end. Brain Donors is the one that fits this category (without most of the unwarranted jokes). <br /> <br /> One point of contention - the end. It seems that the book / director had no idea how to end the comedy. The end is trying to be a love story that somewhat undermines the fast-paced dialogue until that moment. Then there is a scene "tassle". While this should be seen (male view), it ended up and out, it is a shock. One need to rewrite the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap, The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect him and just leave the pun and happy fun come to you, you'll laugh, and I guarantee it.
