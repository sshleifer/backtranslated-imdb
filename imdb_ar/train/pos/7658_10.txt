<br /> <br /> I have watched this movie several times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, engraved in my memory never leave me a scene where Mickey Rooney knows, "Keller Mears" knows he will be executed and approaches the moment of truth, dances and cries and laughs, oscillates from hysteria to ecstasy and manages maneuvering ever passion. I have never seen such a wonderful performance by any actor who lives or dies, past or present. Then I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, Andy Hardy was and still is a great genius. However, I kept my own mind for years thinking, certainly I must be alone in this view. After about 15 years or so after watching this movie for the last time on television, I came across an old question and answer section in the Los Angeles Times. The question was asked by Laurence Olivier: "Mr. Olivier, you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, so do you consider him one of the greatest actors?" His answer was Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney, but I was not surprised. Immediately, I returned to the film "Killer Mears" and felt very satisfied to see this great ability, and now my view is supported by another work I liked. Later, there were Bill and many others moments with Mickey Rooney. You should watch this movie, "The Last Mile" by all working students. Frankly, I can not remember much about the film after all these years, but Mr. Rooney in it will never leave me. If anyone remembers this movie as I do? I will be interested in listening to you. For this picture engraved in my heart alone I gave it only 10 on the face of his performance.
