The meteorite falls into a small town country, bringing a jelly creature. The old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Anita Coursewott) take him to Dr. T. Halen (Stephen Chase). The local doctor treats the blister carefully and asks Steve to investigate where the old man is. When Steve returns, he sees the point killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the population, but no one believes in them, while the poor sweeps a lot of people, grows bigger and becomes bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and classic scientific. It's a low budget movie, with many actors and ham actresses (except for Steve McQueen), the horrifying effects, but also delicious and very funny, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classic genre (I've seen a remake in 1988 with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and the science fiction B-50s. The subject of the film in my 1400 rating can not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
