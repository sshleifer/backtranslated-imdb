I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it is a very, very time-consuming movie, and the first time (and probably only) the movie studio is attached entirely to Dead End Kids. <br /> <br /> The Warner's gave the boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and budget "A", to an almost magical group of supporting actors. At every turn, we get one of those gem shows from the real pros. The number is too large, but everyone on the Warner Sans list seems to be walking in this picture. (See if you can locate John Redelli) <br /> <br /> The only outstanding performance is Eduardo Sianelli, who is always reliable as the leader of the mob with a Christian community. He plays this character just like the Thuggie leader's character in "Gunga Din". It's something to watch! Marjorie Mayne is excellent and has gotten her best role since the "dead end". <br /> <br /> Casual for this one is a second feature in a double bill with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Hooray for the Warners!
