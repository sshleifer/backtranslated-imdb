I never saw this when I was a child, so it was seen with new eyes. I never heard of it and hired it for my 5 year old daughter. In addition, the idea of ​​Christopher and I sing and dance made me curious. Your cheesy Forex, singing and dancing are humble. But the story is wonderful. My daughter was amazing. I liked watching "Walkin" in this role and thinking about what the future holds for him. Very entertaining to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, they were at least not too sweet for Disney. The golly scenery at first was very scary for her and was a little tense when I saw him again at the end, but most of them were benign. Interestingly, we have recently read "Puss in Boots" and have questioned the credibility of the story. But while maintaining the fulfillment of almost all aspects, Walken acted to make it a ratification. Great fun. I was watching him again with my daughter.
