I enjoyed this film and I had a very low expectation because of all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious about what the uproar was about because some publications were very angry with this film and with the Koreans. Oh and it's Korea that put some of my favorite movies. I liked the host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy films are: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate and Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not as confusing as everyone said the monsters looked good and the battles were fantastic. There are some holes in the story but it does not really matter. I've set things like this and stopped asking a long time ago when I see summer films. The Korean myth was interesting, the reincarnation things were different, and I think the main characters wear suspicious clothes like Korean actors in other programs. Asian Ethan (Asian) felt Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its strange sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity in this kind of turnout. Maybe a combination of hosts and dragon war in the future?
