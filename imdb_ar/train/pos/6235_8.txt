This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorite movies. Most of the A-R films feature fantastic but wonderful romantic stories. This still enjoys the sweetness of engagement but not as clear as other films. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only a great dance but also a favorite character and a host of good songs. Music is the main theme here, and the nice thing is to add a single song from Rogers. She was not only a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and a wonderful figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and she is always an enjoyable couple to watch on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the fifties of the last century watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Heliard. It was no surprise that Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she was a hairstyle in the early 1930s, I immediately recognized her voice. In this film also a quick appearance of my house Jable and Lucille Paul, but I must admit that I have not brought out the ball yet. I can not find them, but I know they are here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, with the exception of some nasty chewing gum in the first third of the film, was fun and watching and Randolph Scott - although she was the best in Westerners - was also loved. <br /> <br /> This is a nice, fun movie and feels good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
