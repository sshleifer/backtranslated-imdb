I would not be surprised if Soderberg was pressed to avoid making pre-revolutionary Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Just read a few statistics you will not make with the younger crowd. However, the first part, which was almost entirely released in the forest, captures the feeling of that place, especially when crossing the mountainous regions of Cuba. I loved the interpretation of Del Toro's character Che Guevara. The actor who plays the role of Castro, Bichir, did a great job, despite all odds. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is also clear that he will not demand their cause to "yanquis" away from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I have read. To my knowledge, Castro did not resort to the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other fronts, he was right, especially with regard to the looting of expatriates because the island had taken control of the other rebels. I left the treasury of the state empty.
