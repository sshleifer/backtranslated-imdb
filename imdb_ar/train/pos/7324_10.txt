My favorite horror films from the first long tracking screenshot and until the story unfolds, this is the Carpenter masterpiece. <br /> <br /> On Halloween night in 1963, Michael Myers killed his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. On the night of Halloween, Michael returned to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, chasing Michael and killing the nannies. No bells or sirens, just the basics. It is the super-energy Carpenter atmosphere that generates tension. Like any terrifying horror film, events are sent over the cable in advance, yet they seem to occur randomly, and never allow the audience the chance to guess the film. <br /> <br /> Dark lighting, long long lighting, camera shots (and more importantly) that strange music curse create more frightening and uncomfortable scenes I have not seen in the movie. There is a physical count, but compared with a large number of slashes after this, it is fairly small. Most of the murders are almost bloody. Fear is not in death, but in lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> The representation is good around the clock. PJ Soles offers a lot of humor-limited films (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Lomis turns out to be a decent performer and then there's the young (at the time) Jimmy Lee Curtis. At first, her performance seems timid and uncertain, but you quickly realize that it is ideal for the character, who is herself shy, insecure and totally unprepared for what she wants to face. And of course there is actor designer Donald Pleissens quite as a stylist (and perhaps a little unsteady) Dr Sam Lomis. I lay in peace, Mr Blaiseans. <br /> <br /> If the film has a harmful defect, it will be over time. Since the movie was released a few years ago, countless clones, copies, jesters and film imitators (usually bad) have come closer to becoming familiar. In conjunction with changes in public expectations and appetite, one finds that many raw films are diluted. In order to really appreciate it in this day and age, it must be seen as it was before, as something unique. <br /> <br /> Never, I have no reservation with strongly recommending this movie to anyone looking for good, scary time. Top rulers. <br /> <br /> 10/10
