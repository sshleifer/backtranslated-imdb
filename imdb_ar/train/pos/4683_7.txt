(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried on their necks in the sand? (Answer) a good start. Well, I do not know Peter Matty from Adam, but if he is the emerging author, his film "Love in Time of Money" is a "good start." Shoot with whimsical music-style music box, this flick looks at a series of weak relationships as it moves from person to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ends with A & B people in fashion Carousel . The film gently examines the unpleasant conditions of nine people who suffer from carefully rendered shadows that start and end with a prostitute on the street with her client. The downside of this film is the lack of a story that may have to do with the many critical criticisms it has received. I watched the giant "Angels in America" ​​last night and I was finally bored while this little sequence of character studies kept me bound. Be careful. I may be the only person who really likes this thing. (B)
