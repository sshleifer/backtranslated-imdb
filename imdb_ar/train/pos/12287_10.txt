Although the story is fictional, it is derived from reality not only in the history of Latin American countries but in the Third World. This is the modern and sincere history of these countries which has been summarized briefly in this novel / film. Exaggerated supernatural things, eased the historical events presented in this film. After all things above natural are part of the culture of the Third World. Although critics are not well-liked (perhaps because of the abnormal stuff), it is an excellent film, with a wonderful story and a wonderful actor.
