This science fiction masterpiece has many flaws after the editors killed it after it opened in 1936. Surprisingly, we see visually, but the text allows many intellectual speeches about war and progress. It is given to recite many high-minded messages at all times. Raymond Massie and Cedric Hardwick, both great actors, are affected as a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good, like The Boss, a paranoid warlord. The prediction of World War II was very strange since the world was on the brink of the most destructive conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure the war did not turn out as it did in the film. There are some visually stunning montage sequences that leap between the different episodes of the film. Although it is not as entertaining as you wish it to be, this movie remains in your mind long after watching it.
