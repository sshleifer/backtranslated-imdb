I was very surprised with this flick. Although it was obvious that there was still a shortage of their budget, you only have to wonder that this movie took 7 years to do and still works well. The acting was very impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint is that the end was a bit surprising for my taste. But hey if your audience is hesitant, this film has worked. <br /> <br /> I really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella RÃ­os, who has excellent Spanish talent (something that is hard to find for days with everyone's bad novel on acting). Antonella Rios is really a star on the rise.
