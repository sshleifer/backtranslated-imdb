Although she is younger in this film, it is not very difficult to know who will be the future Mrs. Pomfrey of the BBC series, all the big and small creatures! Truly a "return" effective for both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The musical result is written by the famous Swiss composer Arthur HÃ¶nger and is also unusual. For the time (1936) they seem to have really used large groups or effects that make it seem so. Finally, it's a really good story.
