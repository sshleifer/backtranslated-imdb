An example of how to make a documentary about World War II, using direct accounts of the actual forces and civilians who took part in this terrible conflict, and archived footage that have been assembled from time to time. I have seen this in a rerun of History Channel about a year and a half ago, with no real knowledge of the Second World War at the time, but it invaded me, and now I consider myself a Portuguese from World War II, watching and reading whatever and everything I can find, Approaching this important documentary, it is certainly worth buying the packaged collection of ............. <br /> <br /> It is just a documentary work of the highest standards.
