I read all of Nancy Drew as an excuse and collected the books as a bigger. I liked the effect used at the end of the film (and initially a bit) as the graphics in the book style turned into scenes from the film. It was a great way to illustrate the links between positions in film and books. For example, the scenes with the Eastern antiques dealer reminded us of many of the scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was filmed in full, and Emma Roberts was a great interpretation of Nancy Drew's 21st century. (Just like Betty Crocker's picture, it's up to date!)
