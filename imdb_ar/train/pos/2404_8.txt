I'm a big fan of M Lillard so I ended up watching this movie. Frankly, I doubt that if I was not in the movie to enjoy it much or even saw it, but once I saw it, I realized that the story was beautiful. Bad end I have to say but I saw her coming. It's a low budget film and some of the actors were not really good but overall I rated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The thrill of wondering what Lillard really was was what kept me really interested in this film. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
