His choice of films, the "basic idea" of production (which sets him in groups or mimics the films he hangs on) and his delivery is great! But if you want Freud, beware that you get a copy of Zizek from Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek offers complex ideas enthusiastically and convincingly. The difficulty lies in that it is extremely mercurial, so there may be more in Gusto than it is in actual content. Cinematically, it is a gem. Psychologically, this would make people of all persuasion (Freudians, Lacanians, and Jungians) scratch their heads but reach the popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon for itself.
