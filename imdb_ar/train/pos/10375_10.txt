The Australian footballer (Matt) goes from the countryside to the city the night before a very important trial with AFL, chosen by his cousin. Things get worse. <br /> <br /> His unpopular cousin mixed up in a drug deal involving a local shark / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like a gangster anywhere but definitely Australian). Needless to say, Matt is in a mess, and it was not long before the thoughts of tomorrow's game turned to his mind when the frantic night unfolded. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare is a professional in Western Australia. Actor Toby Malone has a wonderful performance in the role of Matt, a young, naive young man who successfully plays a much smaller role. The best support from John Batchelor comes as Tiny, and the entertainment role of David Ngoombujarra as a police officer after the events. Fast roll the pace, often funny, very worthwhile use for an hour.
