To be honest I saw this movie just because of my puppy needs. I mean, I could not get women in my age (I was 9 or 10 years old) so I thought watching the Elvira split was the closest thing to having sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a wonderful time with this classic worship about horror comedy, Halloween parties, humor, and some interesting evil presented by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They are no longer making such films anymore ... It was a sense of amateur effort mixed with a late-night cable talk show host style. <br /> <br /> The truth is that they produced a lot of fans because of the humor and ability to perform by Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This classic reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
