I could not have been happier; only at the age of 8 in 1983, I would have seen Star Wars in the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. Until that time, my Star Wars experience was some of HBO's Star Wars offerings. I have not even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> My boy, that day did not deliver my eyes less critically. Jaba. The Big Space Rebel. the emperor. Light glitters green! Wonderful! Since that magical day, I have to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can not even make an accurate estimate at this stage. With these multiple scenes, I noticed of course that this film - the third real episode - is flawed. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of Star Wars, the "flaws" are like "quirks." <br /> <br /> Millions spent their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983, I had a day. This was my Star Wars movie.
