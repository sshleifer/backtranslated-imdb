I have just finished watching this film in my class history of high school diploma. It was exciting and was a great idea of ​​what really happened to Steve Pico during the apartheid era. How could anyone say that this movie was the most boring or boring two and a half hours in his life, and I do not know it because he made me hooked from start to finish. It was a wonderful picture of how Denzel Washington showed how he was fighting the apartheid law and getting equal rights for the black people. In one part, Steve Pico tells one of the police officers that we are very weak and humane, and this shows them that he and all black people in South Africa did not differ from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was a bastion of what he believed and did not believe in apartheid. He and Steve Pico created a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I enjoyed this movie very much and strongly recommend this to people. This helped me to see that racism is not true and that everyone is equal, and that their fate should not be determined by the color of a person's skin. N
