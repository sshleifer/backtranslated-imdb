When my sister said that this film would be good, I had second thoughts but I saw it and it was really funny. Basically, the movie consists of a strange girl going to a small town nobody likes and only wants to go there and get to read her maiden so she can not go. But not all that is easy. In this film, you will encounter the fun and charming humor, the book of talismans / recipes, his mentally handicapped uncle and the dog. You'll understand the meaning of the word freak a anyway, I hope you run out of time and try to find this really old movie. I hope you like it overall, I will have to give it 0 .... No, I'm joking, give it 9 Hope you understand that you will laugh, you will scream, and you may be hurt. <br /> <br /> I really loved you: Dakota You can e-mail me at dakota_loves_it@hotmail.com if you want
