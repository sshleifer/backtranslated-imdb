I first came across 'My Tutor Friend' by mistake a year or two ago while browsing the TV. Before that, I had never seen any Korean films before in my entire life, so MTF was the first Korean film I ever saw. And - What a pleasant surprise! I was thoroughly enjoying from start to finish and had a great time laughing. Her comic style is quite different from Hong Kong's (I used to use it all my life and so tired of me), as fresh air blows through the experience of watching a wet film. I thought there were a few sights and tricks in MTF that were fun, fun and original as well. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF for the second time a few days ago, and I have already seen it once, the sudden / comic effect on some kind of mitigation. However, this did not adversely affect my opinion in the film. Instead, another thing came during this time - I was moved - the story about how two young men, seemingly "enemies", came together, how to gradually resolve their differences and begin to pay attention to each other without realizing the feelings themselves. long. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are really compatible because they have something pure and real inside, a quality that separates them from people like Ji Ji's esteemed friend, Ji. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film is divided into two distinct parts - the first part deals with "fighting" between Suo Wan and John Hun, which is more violent and faster in speed. After passing Ji Hoon in his final exam and dancing Su Wan (dancing in the view of Ji Hoon), things started to change. The pace slowed down ... Jie Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares about Su Wan more than he ever imagined. So the second part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, which of course leads to a happy ending accompanied by a final confrontation with the head of the gang. <br /> <br /> Just a last comment. I find this to be a bit unbelievable - the fact that the 21-year-old "bad boy" who declares himself embarrassed to be almost disgraced by the girl who is afraid and loses his "calm" is just a little. Individual. I think this shows that Ji Hoon is just a pure boy in the heart and not what his appearance really looks like. Btw, Kwong San Wu (Jie Hoon) has a sexy body and perfect personality! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF will definitely list your top 10 favorite movies at all.
