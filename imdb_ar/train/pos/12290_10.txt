Hotel Du Nord is a crime-ridden drama where Marcel Carney portrayed an amusing story of the doomed love that also acts as a rebellion against the harsh world. The film is based entirely on a couple of desperate lovers. Pierre and Rene have sinned when they think suicide will put an end to their misery. Du Nord is unique in its charm because its residents have become an integral part of the establishment. There is an element of teamwork where everyone pours into the Du Nord Hotel for dining and chat, and Marcel Carney remains faithful to the spirit of the films produced in the 1930s and 1940s, where De Nord has a certain sense of nostalgia. White gives a unique kind of poetic realism to his festival. Du Nord can be described as the essence of cinematic populism. The scene of the ball on the 14th of July on the banks of the Canal Saint Martin is a wonderful series. Many people can be judged by the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared a national landmark.
