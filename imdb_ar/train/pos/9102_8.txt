I saw this film at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, one of the best films I have seen this year. His vision on a big screen (I mean BIG, not one of the television screens owned by most cinemas) has an excellent sound system that always enhances cinematic experience, where the film takes your eyes and ears and absorbs you into the story. <br /> <br /> The movie features a group of characters, loosely connected. Their stories intersect with some points, and the lines of the story reminded me a lot of Robert Altman and his great films. But it is clear that the real hero of the film is the city of Madrid, which provides the entire film background. It includes characters, contains sidewalks and roads they walk on, and sets the background for all events, all in beautifully photographed scenes. <br /> <br /> The film returns time and time again to certain themes (shoes), for example. In essence, Salazar makes his metaphors increasingly understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. Combines city views and character shots, and matches the elegance of the background scene. A group of talented actors help him portray a wide range of characters. An excellent example is the scene where Joaquin Anita takes her across the street for the first time. This may not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a large screen. <br /> <br /> The movie's message is very positive, so the film is light and sometimes funny. The music along the film is often rich, with some music pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack someday, although I doubt very much that I will). <br /> <br /> All of us, this movie came out with a sexy feeling, and I'm not easily dazzled (you'll have to take my words for it). For this and more I give this 8/10 solid film.
