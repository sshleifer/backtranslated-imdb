Ella was excellent, Frances was undisputed (but he played similar parts in other films like "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost nonexistent but the film was certainly "delightful". <br /> <br /> * Moderate spoiler forward *: I wonder how often Elisha Cook choked in his movies but I seem to remember many other examples. I will avoid naming the killer but I think it is necessarily obvious because of the demands of the "sensational" plot. <br /> <br /> Nawar's film is a good hit but a historian (for example: everyone smoking like crazy and the police were really full characters, and no bodies were shown at all, unlike today's massive festivals). For this period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
