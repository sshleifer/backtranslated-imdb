This film is not for everyone. You are either bright enough to get "it" or you do not. Fans of science fiction movies who do not take themselves very seriously will definitely enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie to those who can appreciate parody and parody. I have recommended this movie to everyone. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks, you may enjoy this movie. Tongue-style voice profiles are made in the cheek and individual lines are quickly and furiously developed.
