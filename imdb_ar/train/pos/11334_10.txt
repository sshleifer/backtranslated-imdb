I would like to say that this film gives insight into the trauma that a small mind can face when a family is separated by divorce or any other disaster. I highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to make a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters very attractive and enthusiastic of many dimensions. <br /> <br /> Although these scary monsters may not be intimidating to most adults, they have a real hint of what can be created by the excessive imagination of a child who faces an unknown terror. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fun!
