La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic film in Spain. Everything that happens in this film has a symbolic meaning. It's quite different from the usual film you can get. <br /> <br /> This movie is good but it will be good only for people who want to find the meaning of everything in the story of the film. I should advise that this is not a typical film. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
