The movie as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent like Chip Hardesty, with perfect roles by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by the legendary director Mervin Leroy, was constantly examined, and each aspect of the film, up to the clothing, was approved by J. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had anything to boast about. He managed his office from 1924 until his death from the finest investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover had already begun to worry about being forced out and was already collecting files on strong people to make sure his small kingdom was protected. He was determined to make sure no animation showed even a single wart around the office. The films only show continuous successes and a glimpse into the failures that occurred, and the role of the office in witch hunt in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the cheek.
