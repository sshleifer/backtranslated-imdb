"California" is a wonderful Hollywood story of thrill and terror, tells of two couples who drive across the country to California to share the cost of gas: a pair of losers (Louis & Pitt) and two willing artists, photographer and writer (Dochovny and Forbes). House "nails" whose character is the focus of this excitement is somewhat predictable. A good hour for those in the psychic killer flic.
