A largely consumed black comedy, and the finest in a series of great Guinol movies to follow "Baby Jane". Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of convicted young murderers (a reference to "coercion") who flee to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for upcoming film voices, a group of children who are not gifted with the joy of the stage mothers. Deppie, in her blond wig ("I'm Harlow, you're more than Marion Davis" played by Winters) leads the Tots in their concert and wins my rich father, Weaver. They do a delicious tango dance and, most importantly, they perform superbly, unlike anything they have done before. The atmosphere is a good mix of comic and exotic. Looks great with great period details (30). Lots of beautiful hits in Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Michelle McAlmuir has a ball as a drama coach: "Hamilton Star", flops, "two but two Neboys." His vision and love.
