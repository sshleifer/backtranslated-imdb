The Wooden Horse was one of the first "Great" escape stories of World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really loved this film, but on the VHS of Amazon in England and its transfer from PAL format in the United States I read the book when I was in high school, after I saw part of the film in the early 1960s on television The satirical drama by Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the escape journey that was filmed in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be made available to the American public.
