I was in the film too, but I do not know if they actually put this scene. On our way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at the service station at the same time they were making the movie, and we (all of us) were asked to jog and scream! Free bird! We were all about ten years old, could anyone watching the movie tell me if this part had already been saved in the movie, it would be nice to know! I remember thinking that the film never came out, because it was two and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I think it was a very successful film, and I bought it, but first I'd like to know if you're subscribed! : D Thank you
