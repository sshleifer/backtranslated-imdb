While standing with Eddie Murphy, women from the audience yell at Eddie and a man from the audience responds. What is said is, the woman - is Mr. Rob (this is the character of the Saturday night live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. Unlike the previous publication that says women are stingy, this is not true, although the distance said that they should have a hearing problem! Despite what post post says about not being able to be here on a DVD, you can listen closely because you actually can hear it on DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps anyone curious out cheering gas cheers !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
