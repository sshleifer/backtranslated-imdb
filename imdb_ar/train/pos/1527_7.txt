When the movie was shown, this film seemed to sound good and look great. A feast of thoughtful, intelligent representation from Gilgod, Kenneth Hay, Harry Andrews, especially Anton and the Brooke, and a moving central performance by Jean Sieber, who is incredibly beautiful and young. Bremer does not jump and shows - his long slowness encourages you to listen and meditate, and writes Graham Green's text intensifying Shaw without sacrificing complexity. This piece features a look made for a TV movie, and certainly not linked to the studio but nothing worse. Many contemporary films dealing with "historical" themes can not resist regression. What did Mel Gibson make of the maid? There are likely to be many saliva shots on the shelf, then roam on the barbecue while the flames are on fire. Bremer does not do anything of this. Burning appears mainly through a guilty reaction. There are a few weak displays, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I took this movie on television and did not expect to see it, but I was shocked. In our time of fundamentalism and religious sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
