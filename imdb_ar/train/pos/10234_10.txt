<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of the new Brothers-Brothers movement and the irony of the urban Ringo Lam. When you watch a movie, you may feel that the scenes of fighting are only of a modest nature but that does not matter, it is an important position and atmosphere. This great movie has both! He always tries to be different from his contemporaries, giving us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and setting them up as "Raiders of the Lost Ark." However, these are not cool comic incarnations you might see in Jet Li. Instead, these men fight to death with brutal results. What makes the film better is that anyone can die at any time, there is no curb. Very bad, they do not make such films very much.
