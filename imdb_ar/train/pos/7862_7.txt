Here is evidence of why Mary Beckford is "America's lover." In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the little daughter of Squash who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of a "hilltop hat". The scenes where they steal a kiss and fall in love are simply exhilarating. She is ready to shower. Mary's ability to end this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing because of her meager position. "5 Tess has to face many physical and emotional challenges: she does so with courage I have not seen in many The heroine at the time.Tice packs the wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone.The reason for her consent to help the daughter of "Top Hill" surpasses me, but she sacrifices her happiness in order to keep her deep secret. Born in Denmark, Jean Hirschult is just as wonderful as the villain, and the scene he deals with is too small to make vegetables (or anything) on ​​the screen. Forrest Robinson (who plays the role of Dadi Skinner) wore a beard, would match the WWI model that recruited Uncle Sam's posters? He wants you! <br /> <br /> Although the story is predictable and somewhat slow At the beginning, it is worth investing in your time to see the piece or "Americana." The film highlights the options available to all of us that include making someone else happy and what it would be like to be a true Christian. Recommended.
