I liked the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not developed enough. I personally thought that the girls were very frightened before being kicked in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt they lacked the link that they were supposed to have for their best friends. For example, in the montage where they see the vision, the way they kept each other to the picture seemed very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Then, there are some very ambiguous parts. I think it's pretty much understood that the Danish character did not do it, but I can see how it can be so confusing. Also, why put the camera on the manat bearing a very bleak expression after putting the bags in the taxi box? I thought he was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Regardless, the film was great. I cried when Claire Danis was blamed. She is a wonderful actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see that the crazed Thai prisoner gets kicked. Talking about the lack of closure ...
