Much to the anger of her adult children Immediately after the death of Dame Judy Dench, the tenor saxophone player, the attic, is determined to go back to her musical hobby. Now that George has died, Elizabeth is no longer forced to play Sachs in the attic. As her happiness grows in the open, Elisabeth runs along the memory corridor, remembering when she was 15 years old in the jazz band "The Blonde Bombshells": supposed to be a group of World War II war girls. Jazz Swing. He was a member of the "Blonde Bomb Bomb" band, the female drummer in dress, Patrick (Ian Holm), to whom Elizabeth remained friends. Daughter, Joanna (Millie Findley), press Elizabeth to bring together former band members and review performance together again; this time as a bunch of sexagenarians. Dina (Olympia Dekakis), a trumpet singer, alcoholic addict, widow and widow living from the many riches of her marriage at the Scottish fortress of Kreigivar; Annie (June Whitefield), as a Trooper of the Salvation Army; Betty (the late pianist, Joan Sims), who is in the ivory keys training in Hastings Pub. <br /> <br /> As Elizabeth, Patrick and Joanna explore the world for members of the 1940s and try to convince them to resume performance together, Elizabeth is often beside her because she learns more than she wants to know about their adult lives - including her life - while the blast was playing brilliant music with another of the "bomb bomb blonde" live. <br /> <br /> Fun, nostalgic, historical, emotional and multi-generational entertainment is very enjoyable. The actors make wonderful presentations. Regardless of their age, they are still the Bombshell artists who made a wonderful show. (The DVD is now turned off and owned because of bonus features and Dolby Digital sound). VHS is certainly a fan of any of these wonderful actors.
