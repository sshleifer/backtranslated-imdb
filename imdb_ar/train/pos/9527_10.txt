This is the best film ever made. She deserves more than she did at the Oscars. This film has been nominated for such things as its result, technical direction and supporting role (Newman), easily nominated for best film, director Mendes, actor Hanks, assistant actor Newman and law. Hanks presents one of his best performances, and the kid who played Michel Jr. was so good that I was surprised that I did not see him in more films today. Critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. But besides the amazing performances, there is another real star to this film is the amazing music. This was by far the best result of the year. Recommended but did not win. It's a wonderful movie that everyone should see. My Grade A +
