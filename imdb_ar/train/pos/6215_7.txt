While I'm not a fan of musicals, I loved Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because it's very fun. Sure, it can be a bit equivalent, but although you know what will happen, it is still very enjoyable to watch. However, though, I was a little disappointed on this trip. It was part of that because this movie does not have the great support staff you've seen in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blur, the film seems a bit lacking - especially in the "Fun" section. The ridiculous alien of these supporting actors gave the magic of other films that you do not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character Astaire plays, this character is more than just a jerk - as his chubby head hinders Rogers again and again. As a result, it is very difficult to like or want to see him meet at the end of the film. Plus, although the music is from Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem memorable. In fact, none of the songs were very special and I can not remember any of them even though I watched the movie. While this film is still interesting and interesting, it lacks the glamor and charm of some of his other films. Good but far from great.
