The reason people say that this movie scared them is because it did !! This means that the purpose of the film was felt by a few of those who saw it. When I first saw this film, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a blood-soaked film, but it's a kind that you think things might be the way the film was written. Of course, unbelievers will say it's just a science fiction film. The truth is that this movie must have to set your thriller movies, even if it has a religious view. If you're a fan of classic excitement (Omen..etc), this is one of them and it must be. I've never seen Distant Thunder, but I think it goes where this film ends.
