When my daughter was now in pre-school age, these shows appeared on A & E from 8-9 every morning. My wife and I have reached an agreement that we will not miss one minute of Jane Eyre and that our children have been delayed from the pre-school every morning throughout the week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I took out the old VHS version recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but he is still perfect like Rochester. It was the dark and warm face, the wicked behavior full of humor and tenderness directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scene, I could not sit down by starring the brilliant William Hurt starring Caran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and are deeply involved in romantic love. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what became Zella Clark. I have died as a cajan, quiet, formal, says volumes but look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the force and nature of the vitality that helped Jane escape the abuse she endured in her youth. Criticizing her performance as a "wooden" misplaced. The servant in an appropriate English family maintained such behavior, but she spoke passionately when emotion overcame her. Unlike many other Jane screens, it looks clear enough to be Jane but it is beautiful enough to allow the audience to purchase its Rochester attractiveness. <br /> <br /> The Brunei dialogue is a large part of why the book continues to keep many of them intact. Dalton and Clark collect the interaction between Jane and Rochester intelligently and quietly. Although Jane looks as clear and exquisite as Vanilla custard, she refuses to be swept away by the vibrant dark Rochester. Monday leads play off each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation for the best romantic novel ever made.
