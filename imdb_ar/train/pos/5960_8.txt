It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she smiles a lot. I also love hearing her sing. A nice change to see from CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was fun, but it seems to have gone beyond some explanation in many parts. Many of the characters seemed miserable in one minute and happy the next day and it was up to your imagination to find out why. Every character was crooked, and in some cases, I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This film was not full of clean, squeamish people, but it was the complex realists who might make mistakes, feel bad about them, and then find a way to fix them.
