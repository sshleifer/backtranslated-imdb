Telemundo must definitely think of working a DVD set from Novela Xica! I know a lot of people including me who wish to be able to buy Novela Xica! It is a very entertaining novel in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where the novel is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of the date of that time period. I hope that Telemundo will transfer it again even if it is two in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is again shown on Telemundo. I've already sent Telemundo via email to a million times to show the novel again but my calls fell on deaf ears. The only warning statement about Shika is that it sometimes contains some harsh scenes so I recommend that children under the age of 14 do not watch a check. Overall Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
