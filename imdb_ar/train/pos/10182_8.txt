Good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. But the main point again as his films tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn the dust into gold. Nana Battkar. This may be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). Although other films are not far behind. A man will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> A good film though I think Shahrukh was a luxury that this film could have done without it. You can see in his movies, while others try hard to reach heights and representation of their skins. But this guy is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> The movie is fantastic, the music and direction are a bit cool but the screen and dialogue are very good again. Must watch.
