This film is a perfect portrayal of The Nutcracker; the dancing is fantastic, the scenery in the background was excellent, and I loved to float on the bed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the fashion ... I loved Marzabani in particular, Tutu was wonderful. The special effects were very good (like tree, bed etc.), and I thoroughly enjoyed the mice. I loved the way they did not make them scary, but cute and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you are a very masculine person, you will not enjoy this, but this is a very good film for all ages - not just all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why should they put a Sugar Plum Fairy partner in those terrible socks? It would hardly make a difference if it was a naked butt! Second, why should EARTH make PINK Colkin?
