I see a lot of really negative publications for people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the United States, at least, until mid-September. Perhaps these unhappy expatriates live in South Korea and saw him early. I'm in the United States and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we're all used to it from many other films. It was not at all difficult to follow. The disposition of the clients was poor, but the others were good. There was teaser around, too. I sorted it at 8 because I had a wonderful time watching it, and that's what I went to.
