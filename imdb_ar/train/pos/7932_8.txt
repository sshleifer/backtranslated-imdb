When I watch a film with a low budget, I know what to expect. I expect not to be well represented (budget reasons) and I expect that lighting will not be good (budget reasons) I expect the sound will not be good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget movie! I am a filmmaker myself so I understood the budget constraints on a low budget movie. Theft sites, screenshots, etc ... The list goes on and on. I do not want to say that everything that happened was bad. Jose Rossetti, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. Not sold to Carl Washington until now. He has to understand that each line is not important, and some of them throw lines. I say if the film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie I gave it 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work for the Queiroz brothers!
