This game is fun and has a layout you can really expect in comedy. Spider-Man was framed by a mysterious imposter. The city is overtaken by strange gas, and shows such as those in Venom and Carnage all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Can it be close to Oak? Well, he seems to have delivered a new paper. The poison does not seem to be too involved because it is upset that Spyder Man apparently cost him a good shot to take pictures. A good veil of other heroes and a lot of bad guys later Spidey will uncover the puzzle. Fighting is basic, not difficult to pick up, battles with bosses are fairly enjoyable. You get a comedy collection, run out of the internet, it's rather fun to cross the city. However, this is also a weakness. This big role does not swing as much as you do in the city where Spider-man seems to hang its nets in the sky. You also do not have much of the ability to maneuver on the Internet either particularly when compared to one of the Spider-Man 2 video games. However, it makes up for some rather bad transformation with other elements and especially the story. So be prepared to see the scorpion, rhinoceros, venom, maestro, Octopus and the massacre to spend one cruise.
