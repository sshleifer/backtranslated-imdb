Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous Voodville comedy, Lewis and Clark, who had not spoken in more than 10 years. Burns retired and took Matau personally and held the grudge ever since. This is the basis of this ridiculous play by Neil Simon that turned into a film. Of course, what makes it good is Matthau and Burns at first, and the most entertaining materials of anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as a nephew of Matau and his client. There are old clips of virtual stars from the Golden Age to connect you to the movie groove, and the actor Fritz's character begins everything with "pop music". The Rosetta LaNoire, which began in the thirties of the last century in the theater with Orson Welles and later became grandma in the "family matters" large in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I've encountered (and maybe I'm being picky and / or serious) is how Mattha Burns are treated when they meet for the first time. Admittedly he has been a lot of resentment all these years, but some of the things he does will be considered rude or just bad bad behaviors taken out of context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau acting that way in other films, but not to George Burns. Khawar Matau tends to become old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a funny movie constantly to help forget your problems, put "The Sunshine Boys". They will raise your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slide it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you should pass it."
