This is one of those Westerners, who stands, practically speaking, alone in the uncomfortable quality of his dialogue. Very few can withstand them in the long term. That said, the rest is very bad. However, I give it to eight people because there is no Western person who has such a good dialogue constantly except for The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps more. <br /> <br /> It's full of weakness, John Drew Barrymore's most obvious. However it contains one truly memorable scene. Nothing like it. Of her right after the child kills Wichita, the prison's mayor, and goes to Jack's place to try to get him to fight. cool stuff. Right with the best in any western.
