If you have a drama in your life, whether it is your own or by someone close to you, the stages of pain that this woman experiences (but, in my opinion, it was possible to be a man too) pass very real. It is a film about your inability to face your pain, and not knowing what to do to help yourself overcome it. It is clear then that it is a film about not knowing how to help someone close to you get hurt. It is a film that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that might push someone to the edge ... hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure I recommend someone to watch this movie, especially someone close to me, but to me ... it's a movie that puts things right, shows real pain, and is therefore relevant to survival. Makes you realize that hey, you or someone close to you has suffered from pain, hey, all the things you worry about now are of very little importance
