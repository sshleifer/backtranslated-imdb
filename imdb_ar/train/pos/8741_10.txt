"Bug Life" is like a favorite dessert bar - it's full of wonderful little pieces that add something to a really delicious thing. <br /> <br /> The story was not the best; it is intelligent, has a "heart" (emotion), and each character has a nice "arc" (growth or change). For comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" that have an "arc" are Buzz, who learns how to love being a game, and Woody who overcomes his displeasure with Buzz. There is a lot of laughter and nice moments in "Bug Life". All actors play a great role in vocal work, and animation, motion and detail are fantastic. <br /> <br /> This serious movie is not interested in "10", but this movie is definitely worth the "10" I gave it.
