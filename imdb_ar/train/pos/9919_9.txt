This stunning and stunning film is "The End of the World Now" without imagination. It is slow-paced and quiet in mood, and it gives a good glimpse of poisoned earth spots that may be signs of an inevitable doom. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my mind - nature is plagued by disease. We have turned greed, the essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, into something like cancer, on its way to consume the host and die with it ... <br /> <br /> The landscaping manufactured is an unforgettable experience - at least I will not look at my toaster And iron the same way again.
