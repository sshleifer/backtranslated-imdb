I had doubts about another love story where people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through sincere communication. It is still not at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh are ideal, almost spectacular, and save this from being just another tear player. Carter's portrayal of the ALS victim is strong, and sometimes exaggerated (sometimes its dialogue turns into indistinguishable ripples). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Prana may be the perfect compliment to its performance. <br /> <br />
