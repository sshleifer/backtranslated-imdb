"Dick Tracy" is a favorite of our family - wonderful actors - exceptional art direction - magic music. It's not supposed to be "To Kill A Mockingbird" - it's an enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's great songs: "Back in Business" is active, "Sooner or Later" is true, "What You Can Lose" is annoying - even tunes such as "Live Alone and Like It" <br /> <br /> I loved the amazing performances of Alabachino, Dustin Hoffman and Glenn mainly, Charlie Cursmo, Mandi Patinkin, James Kan, Dick Van Dyck, supporting the bad guys ... The menu is very long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Betty are wonderful. I wrote with a minute smile (how many times did we look at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I think - it's over!"?). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most telling things in this movie is that everyone involved seems to be having fun - and this adds above all to the fun of the viewer. So, if you have not already done so, why not give "Dick Tracy" a chance - accept it for what it is - a comic strip on Sunday brought back to life - and in a wonderful way !!
