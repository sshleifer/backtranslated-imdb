This movie is actually funny! If you want to rest your mind for an hour, go ahead and see it. Called the blonde and blonder, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy are all our stereotypes about two blondes. It's just a funny movie you see on a date or with a group of friends (especially if you are not very careful ...) It's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art ... Come on, this movie is about blondes. I think the girls will appreciate this film but the guy will definitely appreciate it.
