Nick Nolte presents an excellent performance in the dark story of Kurt Vonnegut. Knott plays the role of Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent in propaganda during World War II. After the war, the unknown lives until rival factions want to discover their past. As with so many works of Vonnegut, this hopes for the futility of war and those who use propaganda to achieve their own goals. Gorgeous - confident of himself as a younger Campbell, then broke and chased as an older man forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
