This movie is very funny !!! Fantastic acting, sexy Ramones, hidden jokes, and plot are just what every secondary student dreams of doing to his / her school. I certainly liked the soundtrack as well as the carefully crafted irony. If you love Monte Python, you will love this movie. This film is a little "grease" (without all the annoying songs). Songs you sing favorite; you may find yourself singing these songs as soon as the movie ends. This musical rank ranked second in musicals for me (second only to Blues Brothers). But please, do not think of it as a music for each saying; see how the songs are very beloved, difficult to know the scene is carefully designed. I think this movie is more than a comedy with romantic tunes. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will remember the days of your old high school after watching this movie. Highly recommended for both family (since it is very young but also for adults because there are many more fun jokes with age and experience.
