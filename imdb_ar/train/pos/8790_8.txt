Hilarious Movie. I watched this film at the Sydney Gay Festival and Lesbian Mardi Gras in 2002, and I laughed from start to finish. The representation was subtle but very funny. I'm not quite sure of the "real world" effect, we do not get it here, but the film stands without understanding this show. Heather B steals every scene, especially in acting with her rare red partner. Highly recommended. I want to watch this version on a video / DVD sometime in the future.
