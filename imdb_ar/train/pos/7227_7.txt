Peter O'Toole is delighted to see the lines in which the lines he speaks are good and give him a chance to show off in a daze. The beautiful York Susanna offers a good frustration to attend the dramatic Otol. <br /> <br /> The film hints at incest - without a single clear scene - but is able to entertain the viewer in the noisy social commentary. Although this is not a major film by any account, it will only be remembered for its entertainment shows. <br /> <br /> Even York, which finally signs the papers, is a great way to watch, and it silently embodies the tragedy. The potential weakness here is Thomson's comfortable direction. But the film is floating because of the actors and the scenario. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie twice over a period of 20 years - on both occasions with the name "Brotherly Love." "Country Dance" is a comic and inappropriate title for this film, wherever it is released.
