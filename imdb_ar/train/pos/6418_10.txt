I love this movie it's a definite inspired film. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth a lease or purchase. Everyone must be at home. The best movie I've seen in a long time. It will make you crazy because everyone means Carl Bracher, but in the end the situation improves. It's the story of romance, drama, movement and lots of funny lines to keep you informed. I love lots of shows. I use them all the time. It helps keep me in the job I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve his dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long film, but every time I see it, I never notice it's length. I have engaged in it, so go very quickly. I like this film. Watch it whenever you can.
