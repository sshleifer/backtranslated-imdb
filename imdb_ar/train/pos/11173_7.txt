Ah, cliché, cliché, cliché; it is a major part of a wide range of horror films. This movie contains many of them. Stephen King is still one of the best masters of horror. This film was really good, just predictable. What is a horror film that does not contain stupid people? This one is packed with retarded victims who beg in practice until their lives are taken. Pet Semetary I found that creepy a bit. The way in which everything was prepared was really scary, but it was not scary. For the most part, the SOMEWHAT representation was believable, the thrill was not so suspicious, but the entertainment level was set in the top rankings. My eyes have been glued to the screen practically. All fans of Stephen King should watch this movie, but as with anyone else, expect a wonderful stir.
