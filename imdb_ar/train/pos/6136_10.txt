I love the knobs and broom sticks so much that I cry a thousand tears of joy each time I get a wonderful pleasure to see it. I would also like to emphasize the simple truth that I love so much. I have 27 copies of the video and I love them all equally. I also love anyone else who likes it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene in Portobello Road. I learned dance movements and practiced them every day. I have some sound recordings myself singing the song. If anyone can play drums or guitar, I'm thinking of forming a ring for knobs and broom bands. I hope to call it "knobs". Loves me
