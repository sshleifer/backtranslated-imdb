In April of 1965, CBS broadcasted the first big Barbara Strisend television show. The show was not only a great success, but also got five Emmy Awards. This is one of the most memorable moments in the 1960s television (unfortunately) this kind of television that is no longer produced. Filled with wonderful songs and wonderful performance from Barbara, this special show has to be seen by any of Streisand's fans and anyone interested in early TV.
