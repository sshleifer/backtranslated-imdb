Not sure that one can call this anti-war film, it shows war at the elite level. These are the elite forces that know what they are doing and proud of. Even when they are peaceful, they still have the skill and defeat of their opponents, even if they are opposed to being peaceful. The films are slow and fairly calm, and in many ways, are tame to a large extent as war films approach today's standards, where no parts of the body fly as in modern films. It is brutal in other ways as you see killing on a personal level. This is more than a man's thinking film. Once you start to watch you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts of men in the film and their interactions, is what the film is about - not the fighting itself or a dramatic story. Probably called the war tiller. <br /> <br /> If you are in the skill of war, if you read or see programs about SAS etc., you will want to watch this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Similar films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with All Stars, The Naked and The Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. They are all unusual in their way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
