William Powell is a doctor who deals with murder and a former wife in "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" and starred Jean Arthur, Eric Blur and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had a chemistry going with any woman I shared with him. Although he and Myrna Loy were the ideal couple on the screen, the actor has made a couple of other "Thin Man" movies, one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthur, both of which had a very good effect. <br /> <br /> In a way, no one is tired of seeing Powell as a brilliant and majestic professional and "the former Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The former lady. B. Mr. B has served with a summons to recover the back expense and then moves on to help him solve the mystery that he has dragged him. This is not the first time you do it! It seems as if there was a movie "Bradford" before this movie or that this was supposed to be the first in a series of films - Mr. Complains that the former mystery writer constantly brings him to the issues. This time, the knight who rides the favorite horse falls into a mysterious journey off the horse and dies directly before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to the issue is somewhat strange, but next to this point. The important point is the joke between the couple and the intervention of the former lady. B. Jean Arthur is very glamorous in her role and very funny. However, with the actress who starts rationally as Arthur does, humor seems intentional rather than brilliant. I suspect that the writer had something else in mind - for example, the curious side of Carol Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "Ah, it may be myself." I was waiting for the police to take her hand, "Paul's rib is more than a dangerous statement. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can play her own role. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
