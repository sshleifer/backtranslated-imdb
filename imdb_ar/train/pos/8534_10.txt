As he learns to adapt to the gravity of his new limited physical condition and adapt, Joel endorses his charming charming fast-talking friend Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes), Bloss, sure, the racist, Bloss (William Fortis), who feels threatened through a variety Multi-ethnic colleagues of patients forced to share room with. Joel also gets great support from his sincere and loving girlfriend, but Anna (married to Helen Hunt). But he still has to live with being disabled on his own. <br /> <br /> The main victory of this wonderful film is its stubborn refusal to sterilize and not sympathize with the severity of what these men are going through. Director Neil Jim√©nez (who has also written the thoughtful and insightful text) and Michel Steinberg relate the story with an extraordinary taste, wit and warmth, and they deal specifically with sincere frankness and the removal of the truth, how the disabled person irrevocably changes one's lifestyle, including your sexuality The point is the most powerful in the eye-catching sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to form love in the hotel room). In addition to the expected brilliance, the film also offers a surprising surplus of sinister, earthy humor, highlighted by the angry sequence, with Joel and Bloss making a night-time trip to the strip club. The excellent acting as another important addition: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all fantastic, with outstanding supporting roles by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss, the friendly mother, Elizabeth Pena and William Allen Young as nurses at the hospital. Despite the bleak theme, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and progressive cinematic testimony to the amazing power and durability of the human spirit. Simply wonderful small gem of the drama.
