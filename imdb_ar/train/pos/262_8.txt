*** Vandals *** *** Vandals *** <br /> <br /> This movie "Divers" is really interesting. Almost all I know is that it will include a Nazi history and underwater viewers and that everyone will speak the Danish language. But I decided to check it for one reason, the fact that the story develops around a German submarine soaked in World War II. I have been tired of German submarines, especially shipwrecks that can be snorkeled. So I was a bit skeptical about the Danish part, but I appreciated that the subcontractor could weigh this part. Knowing that North films are not always good and unsure of the size of the budget I was on, at the very least, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When you watch I was surprised. <br /> <I had some ideas about the inadequacy of actors, and seeing how some young people are very small, namely the two main actors in particular. It was not a problem, both of them were doing well. As well as other actors, often composed of people in the 1950s and beyond. This makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not unique in any case, but fairly rare. Everything is good. <br /> <br /> For Danish, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was not a problem, she had translations. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspect there will be internal shots as well as underwater shots of the submarine. Having decided that its budget was slim, I thought that this might be appropriate at best and worse at worst. Once again I was surprised that the outside scenes of the debris are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. After being enthusiastic about the German submarines, I knew what the diver should look like, especially inside, and did not let go. The team did some serious research. All this is good. <br /> <br /> I think more people will see this movie just to see some of the shipwreck scenes, so I feel I should issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It has a special purpose purpose. But to give you a hint of what to expect, it is a cross between the seventh type and the ninth type and the Japanese transfer point similar to the I-52. It is a good design of God, and causes a beautiful wreck. <br /> <br /> The setting on an island or a Danish peninsula, I can not remember. It is the summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of the summer as they do each year. Their grandfather is Marin of some kind. Cinematography is pretty beautiful, there are lots of beautiful summer scenes on the island's docks, some newly discovered teenagers' love, beautiful diving weather, and a "perfect" feeling. Again, everything is good. <br /> <br /> The plot is that the island will get some kind of suspicious visitors, as men gather a group of boats, an old minesweeper and their crew. A visitor, a man in his fifties, has a German eagle and a swastika on his back. He remembers all the old people on the island when a German boat sank at the end of the Second World War and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken boat shortly after the bodies of the Germans began to return to shore in 1945. No submarine was found at all. <br /> <br /> What to expect <br /> <br /> The main elements are Nazi experiences, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teenage love, conspiracy and ... surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br/> <br /> I did not expect some supernatural elements to appear in this film, and I was struck by it. Not as a great fan of supernatural events, yet well suited to the story and not a problem. Not like "from the twilight of dawn," where everyone turns into a vampire in the end. This is a little more accurate. <br /> <br /> In general: I gave him a really good film 8. Some of it is due to the fact that it is not a Hollywood film with unlimited resources. She later learned that she had a fair budget and that some representatives were veteran veterans. But even if this is a production of Hollywood production, I will give it 7 or 8. Definitely worth your time. Yes, a child's story somehow, but again a mature story. He has a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventure, which I found very attractive. Again, the cinema is really good. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
