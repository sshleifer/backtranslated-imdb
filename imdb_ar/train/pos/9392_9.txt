I came home late one night and had the TV to see Eskel and Ebert summarizing their choices of the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West", except for two thumbs up and seeing him before he goes away. They will not stay in theaters for long because of distributor problems and lack of promotions, but they say they deserve the best. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon, I followed their advice. They have been right, it has been one of the most fun games in my life. As some readers point out, there are some holes in the plot, and it seems that the last ten minutes never end. But it is well worth it, for the beautiful craftsmanship that entered the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen in my life with Nicolas Cage, but it seems that almost everyone is well represented. Denis Hopper is on top of the top, making him silly but boosting the success of everything else. Groups and music contribute significantly to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I hired him later for my family, it did not work out well. It was difficult to estimate the long scenes that led to tension in the theater, where there were deviations in the house. He deserves your full attention; close the phone and make sure you will not be disturbed and watch every scene and watch it and listen to it, especially at first.
