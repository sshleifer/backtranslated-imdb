Anyone who loves Rostatix ​​will enjoy this movie. I have a few minor complaints, especially about the speed of selecting certain actors (not Mori) who are not really convinced of their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone watching this movie or planning to watch this movie on CBC TV in Canada: The CBC version is similar to the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- it's not watching. It cuts off entire scenes and sub-charts (if possible) from the movie. CBC, which offers most of the films untouched, took half the courage of WHALE music. I do not know why it's terrible what they did to the film. Rent or watch a video in a theater, but do not see it on the CBC screen.
