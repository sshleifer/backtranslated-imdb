If the man in the white suit has been done in America, can not you see either Danny Kay or Jerry Lewis trying to apply Alec Gaines to Sydney Stratton on Alec Guinness? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Alec Guinness movies and certainly one of the best Ealing movies in the UK. It is well suited to the time frame of the new Labor Government and the society it was trying to build. It is amazing how capital and employment can be consistent in times of crisis. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness, this little snooker from a man who is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that never need cleaning, and in fact repels all kinds of exotic material at the moment the dress is touched. <br /> <br /> It is a permanent curse and succeeds. Of course the effects of the type of clothing that will have such an impact on society are not really thought. In the end, everyone is chasing him as if they were fugitives, such as Peter Laurie from M or Ourson Wells in The Stranger or even Robert Newton at Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is a sign of a great comedy film, you can play such a serious situation as that chase as shown in some of the serious movies I mentioned for laughter. The Guinness suit is not only white and haunting for spots, but it glows like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> Unlike Guinness, the best performances are from Cecil Parker as another stupid song, Joan Greenwood as the daughter of the siren and Ernest Thesiger, the UK's largest clothing manufacturer. <br /> <br /> Come to Think about it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and present it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
