As others have said, all the women who go barefoot in this film are mostly very wonderful. The plot aptly demonstrates the hypocrisy of female sexuality. When the men around them want to chase them, but when there are no "men" around them, they become chases for a 14-year-old boy. The boy becomes a really fast man (we must all be lucky in this age!). Then wakes up from the courage to pursue his true love.
