In our family, we are a huge fan of A Christmas Carol and we watch almost every version of Christmas, including Reginald Owen's old 1938 and 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite is the classic black and white 1951, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and its transformational gestures are more accurate. However, this 1984 rendition has its unique advantages and produces a beautiful and entertaining story, fully faithful to the Dickens novel. (See my comments on other film adaptations, if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, Scott is very eccentric and does not make a bad approach. I adore his offspring, take long and hat. He cut the best fashion figure in a lot, and a very handsome man. However, at times Scott seems to enjoy the role that Scrooge plays more than just a few people and does not take it as seriously as it should! <br /> <br /> This delivery has the best atmosphere for Christmas in general, optimistic and optimistic. Somehow you know that this story will have a happy ending. He was shot in Shrewsbury, England, and appears to be very British. The film has a beautiful musical score, with great and lively music in all the appropriate parts of the story. Sometimes, I smell the roasting of chestnuts and singing in copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's full-blown ghost (with the spectacular jaw drop) and the three spirits are all quite convincing. Last Christmas is a beautiful ethereal lady, a wonderful and funny giant Christmas gift, Christmas has yet to come wrapped up and sprouts as always. However, my nephew Scrooge, Fred, found a little serene at first, not as ugly as it should be. I love his nephew's wife, whom they named Janet, with her beautiful hairstyle, her hairstyle. Instead of fooling the blind man, they fabricated a game called Similes for Christmas's birthday party, a small and attractive touch, incorporating Scrooge into the spirit of the thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and the Christmas is a fairly lean (although highly appreciated) Christmas dinner, where Bob (David Warner) sympathizes appropriately and suffers long in his miles of scarves. Susanna Yorke filmed Ms. Crashit in an enchanting manner, which starred with George Scott in the composition of Jane Eyre in 1970. Above all, there is no doubt that this version has the best Tiny Tim, not only an adorable but slightly adorable waif but nausea. With those dark circles under his eyes, it seems unlikely that weak weakness will continue around the clock! <br /> <br /> This is an exhilarating and impressive version of the classic holiday. Through the festive atmosphere, it is sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
