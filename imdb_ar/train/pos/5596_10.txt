"Tenant" is the greatest film by Roman Polanski. I love Chinatown, but this one is much more original and unconventional and creepy frankly. It's also a wonderful black comedy. Some of the people shown in this film were very disturbed afterwards, so be warned that it affects some people this way. Polanski does a great job of leading the "tenant" as well as directing him.
