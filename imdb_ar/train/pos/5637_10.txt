I would just say that I saw this movie twice now and I love it! Great acting Despite being a similar plot to "raise your voice" I think this plot never becomes boring for people who love this kind of thing. It contains some wonderful lessons and shows us that we can do anything if we try. Incredible movie. I'm sure this is the one I will watch for a long time to come. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is a completely realistic plot, maybe not about falling in love, but the part about being different and fighting but getting out the best in the end is very real in real life. The only simple criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would meet the ideal man in her dreams if she was ugly or mediocre? I doubt it ..
