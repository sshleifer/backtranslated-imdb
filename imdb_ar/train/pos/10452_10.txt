I want Celine and Jessie to continue their relationship, and I want to tell them that they are doing well for each other, and in many of the moments in the film we want to die for each other. Their story is what we wanted at all and probably most of us did not arrive. It's about love, but not stupid things like "hillside observation" or that sort of movie. This is life and I believe in it, and I think they were falling ... it was smart and touching. I just finished watching it a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am now emotionally and I felt if love was just a fake idea, but with this film I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and others, something could really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and did not know well July Delpy although Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... now I have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect representation. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (sequel in Paris) a few days before my "before sunrise" vision does not matter. Both are masterpieces. Prove that you do not need to convince the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry my English is trying to improve it. <br /> <br /> Frank in France
