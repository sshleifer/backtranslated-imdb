I do not watch a lot of porn movies, but I love porn stars. I love gory movies. So when I heard about Gore Star-star, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago, and when I heard about all the problems of making and ending the film, I never thought I would actually see it. But I did not feel ashamed to admit that I loved him, even with all his flaws. <br /> <br /> First, the disadvantages. The story takes place in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story she seems to want to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan of Scotland. Why do not you just put it there and skip the third grade report on immigrants / Irish / Halloween? Also, break its own rules by indicating that you are safe on the lanes, but then the cannibals start jogging everywhere. It is not always clear how many cannibals we deal with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously old, but never noticed before. The self-conscious horror film is disturbing as well as characters. The heroine has a recital montage of all her dead friends, including a character she has never met. The end is meaningless. <br /> <br /> So what works? Gore! I certainly wanted more than that, but it was refreshing to see a bad film that I was not afraid to be more than a thin film. Two murders are above the top and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene. Two wild murders are given extended shots on the DVD. I have always thought that Gore could overcome a stupid story and strengthen the dynasty of evil.
