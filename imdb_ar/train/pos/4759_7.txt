The small episode is mainly classy for laughter, but played with intelligent dollop of suspense. Somehow, the infiltration of Mars on a disabled bus is on its way to anywhere, but any passenger is (talking about illegal immigrants!). (From Mars, let's open the border!), To John Hewitt (the most obvious suspect)), along with familiar faces John Archer And Barney Phillips (and a gentle shift from Bill Kinds as a bus driver). Makes for half an hour very entertaining even if the work is limited to one set.
