Domini Enfellrin (Marilyn Dietrich) spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he died he became free - but you do not know what you want. Boris Androvski (Charles Boer) is a monk fled from a monastery to taste more life. They meet by mistake in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can not leave his past behind and can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> Overcome romanticism filled with dialogue and very bad attitudes. Dietrich and Boer do their best to make good performances, but no one can escape from some lines! Still, somehow, is a classic. It was filmed with the wonderful Technicolor technology (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is very beautiful. Dietrich always wears his clothes to the ninth (even in the middle of the desert) and hits him hysterically to show the clothes and her body. Pu'er just walks around the stricken (no shock there). I still have never felt bored. It was wonderful to look at the stupid dialogue without stopping to keep me in stitches. In the end I almost fell out of my seat because I was laughing hard! I now love boring romances and give them a lot of space but in fact - this is incredible! It also takes 80 minutes short. <br /> <br /> As a classic in the camp, I gave this as a serious film - 1.
