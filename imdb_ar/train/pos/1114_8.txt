At that time, I remember being amazed and comfortable by this film. I referred to it as the most important film I have seen in 10 years, and I found myself exposed to people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusual behavioral notebook. The character of the bitter teenager we all had was shaped into an eroded global view of adults. Together, the two offer an amazing mix that can be very moving for some viewers. (Hello, I wish I were not my brother so I could ****!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards looks for herself after returning to Los Angeles from New York, leading to an immersive experience with many characters Everyone is well) for our entertainment, but enough to involve practice to appeal to the "inevitable black" values ​​system that the real measure of their establishment is whether the black culture accepts them. (It was a while, Nina Simone comes to mind, and she has a gorgeous black mistress in the film.) A pretty black girl attends the shows and seems to authorize Sandra in dark black, but eventually rejects her. <br /> <br /> Catholics themselves are lucky to suffer for Christ, here Sandra imagines herself suffering at the hands of a black culture that craves her place; as if she cherishes merit and rejection. It is the only value system involved in the film world, outside of the rotten Bernards' confusion. <br /> <br /> For a country with major issues of racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the two topics dealt with in an atypical way.
