This is a smart drama about the way of life in Texas Tonkey in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Wenger make incredible performances like Buds and Sisi Davis. This film really opens the countryside music scene and helped define America's mechanical revolution. If you like a romantic film, you'll love it.
