I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best games ever, as if it were not the best of the three Lion King movies! In the film Timon and Pumbaa, tell us where they come from and face a problem fitting others like Timon who have trouble tunneling with other Meercats! Timon and Bumba made a journey to find the place of their dreams and find them and soon find him as well as Simba, who is watching him, but soon they have to choose between the place of their dreams or help Simba in the face of the evil uncle and declare his right as the Lion King of pride rock! Full of wonderful new characters like Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character is Uncle Max because he was very fun and his voice was comedian Jerry Steller, father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to throw Stellar in that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, story and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best thing in any sequel and better than Simba's Pride although I will admit I've already done such a person too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that everyone can enjoy! I've got a good story which is very funney! 10 out of 10!
