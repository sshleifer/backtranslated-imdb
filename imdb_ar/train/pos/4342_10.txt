This film did not really surprise me, so it has become better and better. I thought: "Paul Reiser wrote this, huh? Well ... we'll see how he does ..." Then I saw that Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I was not a fan of the show, I always loved watching Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances were so natural that I felt like I was flying on a wall. They played from each other so well that I practically felt pleasure! ... I did not drink wine! <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I wanted to get the phone directly to Paul and inform him as much as I enjoyed! But I did not find his number. They should not be listed or something. <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies that I had no idea what it would be like or who was in it or about anything. She just appeared and thought: "Oh, why not? Let's see ... If I do not like it - I do not have to watch it ..." ... and I ended up loving you!
