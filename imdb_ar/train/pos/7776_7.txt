Does anyone know sports cars 2? I think the character of Robert Stack may have been Masseratti.Rock Hudson's character told his father he would take up a job in Iraq, is not that the time? I've spent Dorothy Malone in my bank for most of my life, maybe that was the film that impressed me. Lauren Bacall certainly had some pieces in this film and probably Malone out of the game but the Malons part had a more dramatic effect for that Oscar Award for Best Supporting Role. Was Lauren's part a key role? Hadley's old personality may have been a fairly common image of the emperors of his time in that he was an ordinary man made great in an emerging industry but in a building his entire children had forgotten to make them his wife raised them. In time, the widows realized that they were all they did and they were pampered, looking for attention, and instead of trying to communicate with their sons, he blew his head off. An old moral tale. But seriously, what were those sports cars?
