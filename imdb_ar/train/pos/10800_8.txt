This movie is much better than the original Jerk. I would highly recommend them to anyone like quirky humor. We have incorporated nearly the number of lines from this film into our daytime speech as we did from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with Hobo and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table and the turtle soup. The original jerk was a very dance they staged. While I love Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying hard. The Jerk Too is a parody and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Too is suitable for the family unlike the original Jerk.
