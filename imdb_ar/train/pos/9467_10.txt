I've been drawn to DAN IN REAL LIFE through the excellent reviews and thirst for a well-written drama - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell plays the starring role in the film, you know that an audience will find LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, which is a very fun and rewarding performance. DAN IN REAL LIFE made this promise. <br /> <br /> The movie is true for many families around the world, losing one of its members and continuing its life in search of something that would bring them back to magic. Before their loss. With Steve Karel and Juliette Benucci, their relationship was beautiful and written so that their scenes were very real for their personalities and their travels. Make the cast, group, and story a single DAN IN REAL LIFE story to remember as we head to upcoming holidays.
