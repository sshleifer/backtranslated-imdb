We loved the movie. I am the mother of two young men. I like to have a movie I can watch where men enjoy integrity and personality. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. The family forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I hope we have seen more of the Davis family. But for all I liked, she left me the same feeling that others felt "please do not end." We hope that the actors will not change. The new actors were a good alternative. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son loved this movie too. He asked me to go and buy them all. He is a film critic until he tells him this tells me something. The whole family should see this step and buy it for friends. Help restore time of values. We will now be reading the books we have compiled. Really hope to see more. Be blessed and happy
