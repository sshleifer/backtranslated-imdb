The United States was still locked in World War II (the film was released between VE and VJ). Any studio worthy of its salute was either the production of combat films where American soldiers who were not afraid to beat the enemy, or the Americans were generally singing and dancing. Technicolor Musical was what flourished America in the bleak days when everything was legalized. Most of the musicals today were just a collection of musical numbers with the best plot available to fill the time to hear the next music number! I felt now that the people who are reviewing this film were all born after 1970. We are sad about the speed of forgetting. <br /> <br /> This movie can be called "Searching for Jose Iturbe" but now everyone is wondering why. Let me explain. From 1929 - arriving in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest pianists on the stage grace ceremony. He agreed to do some movies in 1942, but Hollywood was behind him for almost a decade at the time. Not only is an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi was a largely household word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturby and 17 other pianists were scheduled for one of Leszet's early rap - did not anyone notice that the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film and several other MGM musicals, thanks Iturby to American youth in classical music. Grayson's desire to experiment with Iturby in the film was not different from the real reality of the time. Everybody wanted iturbi at the time. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did a lot of concerts at the military bases). <br /> <br /> Jane Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra was an excellent singer, but at the time of making this film, Sinatra was barely 30 years old and had only been contracting Columbia records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbe was at the time a global sensation for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> With regard to the lack of plot, the Americans did not need a conspiracy. They were tired of the war, they were afraid of their loved ones, and they were worried about the future. They needed happiness, hope and assurance that things would work out well in the end. They needed music, smiles, joy and romance. This film and others like him made what is required. <br /> <br /> Giving enough lectures. The mouse dances aside, the best scene in the film takes place between Sinatra and Iturbe where they complement each other's "clueless" music. <br /> <br /> If you have any interest in Jos√© Iturbi, the Spanish who conquered more America from De Soto, Cortez and De Leon combined, please drop my website www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find the conspiracy summary , Excerpts from reviews of the film "Today" and photos of this and some other MGM musicals in the 1940s, as well as the biography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
