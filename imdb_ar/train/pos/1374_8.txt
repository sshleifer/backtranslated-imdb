The French film will love Esther Williams. But the simultaneous swimming was just a link to the story of three girls in a suburb of Paris find themselves. There is no doubt that the sympathy of Sciamma lies where all the boys are portrayed as "animaux" but in fact, there are only 3 girls in focus, and all the time, with little adults and other teenagers in the background. Mary is a stick for a girl, unattractive, but she is determined. She wants to be a swimmer and impose herself on Florian (a fine beauty for every single review). She is also a friend of Ana's comfort: she was not unattractive, but for her, the time for her body was short, and now she is a teenager in the woman's body. What follows is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a luster around the three abnormal things: Where is the chatter and the weak courage of young people? While this period was impressive, with Florian portraying the beautiful self-absorption, as well as the union of Mary and Ann Gemayel alike, everything seemed abstract, the Sciamma dolls.
