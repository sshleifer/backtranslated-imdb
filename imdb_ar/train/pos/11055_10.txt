Well, what can I say, other than these people are super in everything. I love Sharon McCready, I enjoy this wonderful series of Nostalgic, I have a set of 9-cylinder 30 episodes, I did not realize they made a lot, and I also think it's a shame that they did not make any more. I wish I had been given these powers, imagine me, to get rid of my period, somewhere, and get rid of the cold, and then wake up in a private hospital. Later, I discovered that my body had improved. Just like Richard Barrett. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense along the way, you can not fight these three people, because they will defeat you with all kinds of weapons. Music is well written, and for me, it puts a wonderful picture of three super-beings in my mind, a kind of privilege enjoyed by heroes like our dog or our local cat, improving eyesight, improving hearing and touch. The strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of three women for Sharon. Which I thought was beautiful and smart. When I was a boy, I had a huge crush on them! Now I can see why, on my DVD set. The box is very beautiful and comes with a free booklet on the chain. I also thought Trymane was a good coach, firm but he did things!
