The first time I saw the first feature film from Buster Keaton and I have to admit that I liked it a lot and I just wish I'd stumbled on it for years. Rohor initially cautioned that the three-year-old nitrate edition discovered and saved in 1954 was discovered shortly before the combustion, and that many of the seemingly hopelessly coherent frames had been separated. So, it's rocky in some places, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It was good to be three short films but as a kind of fanaticism, it is innovative and funny from start to finish: in the Stone Age with Paddy Wallace Berry riding an elephant and Judy Buster riding a foal for pets; Trolley with wheel locks and adapted for skiing, no parking signs in Latin. In this technological age of Speed ​​Need and Greed, his car is in a great place at the first hump. Both he and Perry are the girl after the ages, a never-ending conflict. Favorite thing: When the cave man knocks back on the edge of the cliff but still hits a kiss on the camera - two or two amazing! <br /> <br /> Great things, reaffirms my love for the silent comedy movies.
