It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this small gem. Everyone I mentioned has reacted with the same reaction: What are the great movies !! <br /> <br /> I never cared about Brad Pitt (although his role in the 12 monkeys and improve the show of the fighting club)) but his performance in this movie as a psychiatrist is disturbing, dark and on the right. <br /> <br /> Everyone else in the movie delivers excellent performance and slow and deliberate movie speed greatly enhances actions. There is a growing sense of awe for the characters as they realize what has really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this from 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the finish is a bit long and overpriced. But this is the only drawback I can find in this classic worship. <br /> <br /> If you check this movie, try getting the output of the unclassified output to get the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
