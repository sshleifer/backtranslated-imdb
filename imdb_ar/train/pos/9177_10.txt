I must say that this series was the best interpretation of the popular novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clark are highly certified such as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but nothing compares to this version. The best one for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters again. The last time I saw this was in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. At that time, I was running a library and had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was totally fascinated by these little games and I remember that I did not miss any of these episodes. I would like to see it again because it is very good. :-)
