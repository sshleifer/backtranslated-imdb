Watch this movie on its release and its most precious since then. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find one of the most interesting aspects in the film). I really enjoyed watching the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bissett in this role, as Wallace Shawn is always just shouting. The script is clever, malicious and tongue-in-cheek, making fun of almost everything Beverly Hills. I love Paul Bartel's "doctor" and server Ray Charkey. This was a disaster and a blow, but thank God! Unless you are proud, I warmly recommend this film. FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees from Kevin Bacon, Mary, Ronoff and Paul Bartle were at the Rock and Roll High School. Mary, Ronov and Robert Beltran were together on Comet Night. They were the three at Raul Eating.
