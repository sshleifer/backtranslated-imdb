Well, this was one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are too bad you just have to laugh, acting, well suppose that there is no Gibson tilt. But Gary Browning, who plays a very bad police officer, is doing well. I do not know how to make this film the same. But you have to see if the horror movies / counterfeit pieces cause bloody and funny at the same time. Movie Killer.
