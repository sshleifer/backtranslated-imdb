This movie can make you want to see it again. I especially love the way it ended. I have not seen the end coming, but when the laws are not blown up the first time, one is suspected of going back again. <br /> <br /> The story is gripping and may be more psychological, but I understand the story was necessary to capture scenes and the procedure was necessary for that. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe Michael Junior may be affected by his younger brother and his mother. But, I can appreciate that the play could not really draw our attention there because it has a bigger story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some of the Hanks complained as gangs. I think this is not justified. If his character is more difficult, he will not care if he withdraws his son as a catalyst or not. <br /> <br /> Eight Stars for this one. Although released in 2002, I first saw it yesterday on a DVD.
