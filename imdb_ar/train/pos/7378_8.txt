After watching this film last night on Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was first made in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is a supernatural source. Instead of the cursed video, instead we have an ecstatic Astudia and strange images appearing in the movie. In fact, the strange pictures that appear on the movie make the damn video in RINGU instantly. The only thing missing is the mania of water that passes through subsequent Nakata movies. The final scenes are very terrifying, with a simple signal to Murnau, which opens the door on its own and stealth enters the room, reminding me immediately of NOSFERATU. A chilling film would make thinking twice about going up to the podium.
