I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on the video after watching the direct FANTASTIC 2001 version of the movie. Peter Jackson's live "Lord of the Rings" will undoubtedly be better than George Lucas's "Star Wars" series (episodes 1-3) as a real fantasy film from the 21st century! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the animation as a child, and I did not fully understand the depth of the film at the time. Now that I've read the books, I've realized the whole story. Sure, some characters are very silly, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)), But I must say that he follows the book closely and goes to part of the second book, The Two Towers . The good things are that the procedure is fairly interesting and some of the animations are very fascinating because it is time. The bad things are that it abruptly ends halfway through the two towers without any result of Frodo's quest to destroy one ring, and the animation looks completely dated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not as bad as many say. But the direct release version of 2001 is the new feature of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Beckshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animation inspired him to read books, which in turn created one of the greatest fantasy films ever, so at least we can thank Ralph Beckshi for it! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on Harry Potter's direct release on any day! <br /> <br /> A 7 from a scale of 1-10, much less violent than the 2001 version of live action, but nowhere near the good! For hardcore lovers of books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
