I do not strongly agree with anyone who may reject this film as "fair" entertainment. Immediately after the worries, which are wasted in the 1920s, during the early days of the Great Depression, dance, deceit, and dance is essentially a serious warning story, with a clear message about how best to endure these difficult times. However, this film is fast-paced and well-planned away from being a dismal moral story. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Hollywood had a talent for bringing a fun person out to the thrilled audience, without losing a frame of the film. Dance, Fool, Dance - One of the four films directed by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - barely 80 minutes long, yet his characters have been well developed, and her story does not seem to rush, and despite its many transformations in the plot, the audience You will never fall behind. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the individual Lester Vail case that interests Bob Townsend, the support team is uniformly strong. It is worth noting that William Buckwell was Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (known as the voice of Jimini Cricket) as a reporter for Per Scranton, and Clark Gabel in early support roles like gangs Jake Lofa. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's film, and it's completely polished. Made when she was 27 years old, and probably the least known version of Crawford is unknown to those who are more familiar with her work later. However, there is evidence that long before she returned home to the Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a wonderful actress with charisma to carry a picture of herself. <br /> <br /> Result: Eight out of ten
