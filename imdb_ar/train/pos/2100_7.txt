Before entering politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best film actresses in Britain. The film features her talent, although she has a supporting role in an excellent team that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of the British Royal Captain, who has lost his memory for the last 20 years, and Jenny, whose role as American Margaret Margaret played an unknown role as the Point Sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from shock-induced amnesia during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm plays a smaller role as a treating physician. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finley. You can only see Glenda playing a nanny housewife and the real love of the captain but she came from different classes. It is not the greatest film but it is good to see Glenda's brilliant talent. She is still a wonderful actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Gray a likable figure and sees why a royal captain has fallen in love with her.
