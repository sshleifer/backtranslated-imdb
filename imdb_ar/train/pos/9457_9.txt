How can you summarize exactly how you feel good and right and touch this film? For weeks, this DVD has been on the shelf every time I go to the store - after seeing Steve Karel in two previous films, I did not want to distort my thinking - so I resisted and resisted, until I finally grabbed "What the hell!" Attitude behavior! And how surprised I am! I just wish I had purchased earlier. After seeing him three times in two days, I still smile at how a widower copes with three girls, longs for what has been missing since the death of his beloved wife, who meets an interesting woman, a witch in such a deep and interesting (dare to say a book ?), Receives a completely different light on life which makes him realize that what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> The handicap of this woman is his sister's sister-in-law, who imagines Dan shy, faceless and heartbroken, seeing a "special person" bringing this fun and enjoyment to the family home as well as the lives of his brothers. You just really start to feel it. <br /> <br /> Then when the blind date happens with Ruthie Dreber - this is the turning point in Mary's appreciation of Dan's money! The shape she gives when he repeats her comment, about the lack of admiration for Ruthie - Monster-Green-Eyed Monster! It raises a very hilarious scene where the couple compete in the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most actionable serials with Dan starting to downplay Mary. <br /> <br /> Other sights destroy the gut - Dan returns from the bookstore and treatment, faced by his brothers, to describe what just happened .... When Dan's face drops, it brings a great deal of breath !! <br /> <br /> His younger daughter Lilly is making a gift celebrating her love for Susan, his late wife, bringing little warmth and little mystery while Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings in the Talent Show .... his voice cracks a little while he returns to the song. ... an absolute gem! <br /> <br /> Accepting what happens late in the film by his daughters ... The three love their father and want to see him happy, he will not be allowed to deny his love to Mary; Dan's despair does not disappoint his daughters because they rock, stronghold ... and tell him Much more than a few words. <br /> <br /> I can continue but I will leave it now - maybe I'll go back and add more comments here in the near future ... but I'll end by saying .... <br /> <br /> ... If you want to watch a movie this is very good, with comedy subtleties to ease the drama, which does not feel forced or hate, which comes as a real picture of a man discovering a new life - not only with a woman but also with his extended family, So. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 to get this good cinematic experience with a recording from Sondre Lerche, who takes you there all the time while never interfering with performances from the band's crew. I can not wait to re-watch this again!
