The industry dropped the ball on this. The movie trailer does not work, and when it was opened it was full of screens. If people had a chance to see this, oral work would have made it very successful. Each of the main actors presents great emotional performances that really draw you into the story, especially the characters. I reviewed this on the recommendation of rave Richard Roper or (Ebert and Roper) in his book. An example of a great movie that has not been fully released on a few screens. Which gave her no chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they are not good. It is an Oscar, a tragedy on many levels that will never be heard. Maybe by word of mouth you will gain the following on a DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie, you should. Great performance of the two main actors make this film. It could have been just another teen movie after school, but instead stands well in other films worth watching. Girl stops coming to mind. If you love it you will love this. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in a dramatic emotional scene after another without being introverted as a melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and our parents cry in most of the film, it is a real way not to become stereotyped or melodramatic characters. The film will take you in many scenes and if you are an ambitious actor, use these real shows as your teacher. Erica is the best at this than in traffic. I hope that each of these actors will get more roles that benefit from their talents and allow them to shine. Watch this movie, and if you want it, suggest it to friends so that it does not get lost among all the waste that is released every year. The film was buried while Spiderman 2 was the top scorer. What kind of word do we live in? AGHhh. So to make the right world again see this and recommend it.
