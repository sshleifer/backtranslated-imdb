A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17-year-old boy who lives near him while trying to overcome feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic film by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for directing it in the summer of 1942 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the old type. Here are the new arrivals in the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her first film, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, the eldest sister; Jason London, and the court, the boy is 17 years old. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good in her first film appearance, showing all the passion a 14-year-old girl feels in her experience of acne and insulting her. Warfield and London are both good as well. The film accurately depicts the thoughts or feelings of every adolescent with respect to love with a cardiac sensitivity, and never expresses a surplus of modlin even once. Glory to the biographical scenario of Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about acne that is honest and steady in tone without being unreliable or passionate. The music is surprisingly simple, increasing the tone and mood from one scene to another, but never intervening. Beautiful cinematography directed by Freddie Francis, who was in his seventies when he was filmed. Tess Harper and Sam Waterstone play the role of the girl's parents with the deadly aim of 1957, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as a boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and facts to face in this lovely film that contains a love story. So far, this is Robert Muligan's last film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
