This series was set a year after Abidos' mission in Stargate. This explains many of the things that the film ignored. Like, how was Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did Goldold come from? How much is there? <br /> <br /> The first episode contains a retired Jack O'Neill (written with 2 lira) summoned to active duty by General George Hammond for an attack by Strugit of Abovis, the powerful Golold who killed four men and kidnapped a woman. We meet with Samantha Carter, a wonderful scientist who claims to have had to pass Stargate the first time and is determined to move forward now. We discovered that Daniel married Abydos, and that there were hundreds of Gate addresses they could contact. Then Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, where Major General Hammond announces the formation of the nine-team SGC, Jack will be the SG-1 team consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Schulak, a family scientist in Gold to save Daniel's wife and another family member in Abidos called Skara. As Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, Jaffa's Teal'c, the first president of Apophis, saves them and goes with them to the ground, becoming part of the SG-1. <br /> <br /> That was just the beginning of the adventure. During the show, they went to the past and the future, being transferred to alternative realities, mutual bodies, old, foreign races that include a rebel alliance from the Go'uld called Tok'ra, in which Samantha's father becomes a member, Asgard, Often (he is Jack's friend), and avoids the global catastrophe on the skin of their teeth countless times. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled, but lasted for ten seasons. In the ninth season, a new enemy called Ory came in new forces, new dangers and shed light on new mysteries surrounding Stargate and its creators, the ancients. Season 9 and X also featured two new introductions: Ben Broder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Valda Malduran, a humane woman from another world that brings a new sense of humor to the team. <br /> <br /> Great characters, good producers, great special effects and hidden love interests between Samantha and Jack, have it all. Different way to travel the galaxy, different types of adventures, this one offer you do not want to miss. Open the gate and step through. You will not regret!
