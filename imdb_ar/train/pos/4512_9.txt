I watched this movie today and I must say, it was much better than I expected to be about two hours before going to see it. Personally I have some bias because of her language, but she completely changed my idea. In most cases the film was surprisingly good with great actor and actress performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and did everything to reach him. This really touched me and as a film, based on a true story, convinced me. A new school, a psychic director and a boy who knows with a new teacher, is slightly different from the other and fighting for things even if they do not seem to work. Show how small things can make huge changes in many things, and how differences can sometimes occur difficult situations. I also believe that the actor's choices have been quite successful. I really felt like you were watching episodes as a stranger when that happened. Before spoiling this film with praise, I must admit that there are some things and attitudes that did not look and feel realistic ... like those where the schoolmaster beat Fritz aka. Martin in front of the chapter, at the end of the film. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing he did was that some of the blood was coming out of his nose when compared to the first hit at first, when Fritz got some stitches. .. I might say, if one day I find this DVD from the store, I will definitely take it with me.
