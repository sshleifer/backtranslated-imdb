Originally designed as an individual tool for Dudley Moore, "Not only ... but also" his former collaborator at TheBeyond The Fringe, Peter Cook, was seen as a guest at the premiere, and the BBC-2 reception was greeted with great urgency. Be it every week from then on. They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall, handsome and brilliant, while Dudley was short, attractive and musically talented. The painting, which dropped the house in a bar, wearing flat hats and mufflers, put them on film stars like Jean Russell and Greta Garbo. It is still one of the most ridiculous stories of all time, and even when the cook proves that he is still well clinging. <br /> <br /> These characters - a foolish house and a foolish idiot - have found their way into every episode of the appropriate show, appearing in a different setting, such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter, grind sandwiches during the discussion of the artwork. "This cartoon Leonardo da Vinci ... I do not see humor!" Says Dodd. Pitt points out that when he was first revealed, people were likely to be in a good position. Dud almost chokes on his rework. "You really enjoy these sandwiches!" The couple bowed their lips from each other in a way she was happy with. The graphics themselves set new standards for comedy, standards that would not even fit the arrival of "Monty Python". <br /> <br /> With the popularity of the show increasing, the quality of guest stars has increased. Peter Sellers, for example, and John Lennon, the latter features a feature shot based on his poem "Tom Ted, Danut, and I". "One Leg Too Fow" - Dud got "George Spigott" (a name later used in "Bedazzled"), a one-legged man who jumped into the office of the film producer Cook to audition for the Tarzan role. Cook tries to disappoint him as much as possible. "I have nothing against your right leg!" , He says. "The problem is - do not you!" <br /> <br /> Dodd was sometimes met by the eccentric Sir Arthur Streep-Grebling (Cook), who was not studying crows to fly underwater, was planning to open a restaurant called "Frog and Peach". Another classic was the "jump nuns" (also reused in "Bedazzled"). But my "superthunderstingcar" should be my favorite all the time, a funny (and accurate) parody of Jerry and Sylvia Anderson's "Thunderbird". A friendly house played all the roles, with the latter bringing in "Lady Penelope". Ludwig van Beethoven performed Ludwig as a star to show "This Is Tom Jones". "The Immortal Bargo" was a naive documentary about the life of the homeless film star Emma Bargo. In an unforgettable moment, she drove through London, raising her voice loudly: "I want to be alone!" <br /> <br /> The third season feature was "Poets trapped" with the likes of Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rashton and others hanging over a fire tank. Each had to improvise from the line of the poem, and anyone who failed to make it rhyme ended up in bad things. <br /> <br /> Three seasons have been created, produced (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately very few editions survive. To make matters worse, scripts were destroyed as well. The beggars believe this position has allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> The show ended in 1970. Broadway stories were hit, and the infamous "Derek & Clive" tapes were made, but the growing alcohol addiction to alcohol disintegrated. Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was nearing completion, but it turned out that she was thinking of wishing for him. His former partner was making films in America, and he had no intention of working with Cook again (not at that time anyway). <br /> <br /> There were enough footage gathered together for the BBC-2 season to be repeated in the early '90s. As expected, some elements did not hold up as well as others. Cook died in 1995, and by honoring BBC compiled a program compiled from various interviews "Parkinson" and "Not only ... but also." We ended up well with finding David's house and paradise. "Bloody hell!" , The latter exclaimed. Moore passed in 2002.
