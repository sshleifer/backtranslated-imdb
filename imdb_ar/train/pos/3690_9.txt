Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that the heart of man is so small, everyone has this special place that he loves more than anyone else. It seems to me that this may be a motto for some of the most prominent directors today when they began to declare the eternal love of this special place and portray the attitudes in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, where our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne et al. Take a great stroll through the Parisian circle, human feelings, yearnings and expectations. <br /> <br /> Always another quarter, always a very impressive story about ordinary people looking for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, subway station. Paris je t'aime revolves around a wide range of love - love for one partner, child, parents, for those who were world to us but no longer exist, the need that needs to ignite, the pallid love of this strange as meets your eyes or love which is not intended To be ... Today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not only about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, ups and downs daily. The most important thing is the fact that he is not stupid at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie number 9 because the last part of it indicates how some stories may develop more, but not all of them, and that is what I find missing, and "further development" I do not mean some specific signal For the future of characters. As far as everything else is concerned, I can only say ASRA. It makes you want to leave everything behind you, and run away to Paris and live that little romance on your own.
