This film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for many of them to be busy doing nothing. We, as people of African descent, owe it to ourselves to make a change in this cycle of "all talk and no action" and to begin to recognize it for change. There must be less talk and more work. It is a strong demonstration of our people's divisions on small issues, our failures to realize the larger picture and the need for unification to bring about change ... Despite the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray.
