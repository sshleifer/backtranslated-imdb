"Bruce Almighty" sweeps Oscars with a record number of Oscars of 14 wins! Titanic will be the highest movie of all time! Jim Carrey will be so bright at the top level that he will announce his candidacy for the presidency in the White House qualifiers in 2004. Almighty then! You will not imagine these great fantasies unless directors (including Carrie) have the powers of God. This same premise is the main element in the new Barbie "Almighty Almighty" riot. Cary plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor that he holds God fully responsible for his colleagues. God, played by heavenly Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the "gift of God" (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. It is clear that Bruce is being "taken care of" by his noble colleges that he has discovered and uses them selfishly. Cary returned in his comedy picture Almighty in the film "Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston was not "wrong" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, the prime minister goes to the director Tom Shadyak not to let the dog out for 2, and shows us the most joyful bathroom scene at all times! "Bruce Almighty" is no more Carrie deepened movies, but he is still laughing laughing show of "Carreyism"! **** Hassan
