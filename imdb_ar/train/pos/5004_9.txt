But just amusing and random! Love it or hate it, but do not expect sophisticated or pointed plot. Think of it like Seinfeld, but without following up and repeating offers to exotic characters (well ... so far, I have the feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creature amenities" are not for the faint of humor - they aim to enjoy the least effort from your mind. That's why this show embodies all I need in a program when I come home from work in the evening: a superficial conversation in the background with the proper amount of "gentle" characters I can enjoy when I finally search a computer to see what I'm missing. <br /> <br /> More entertaining than most soap operas today, quieter than an evening at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and back. I can not wait for the next time.
