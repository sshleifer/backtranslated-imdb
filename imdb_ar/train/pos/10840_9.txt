In the sound of the film, Hugh (Billy Connolly), a band in the great 1970s Stringing Fruit, said the reason why lightning made a rock festival to stop the String Fruit group was because God was fed up with the transgressions of the 1970s. In fact, it was common to extinguish that era of music, and seeing the villain as a welcome antidote. Although I agree that the surplus was cumbersome (as well as the urge to dislike the women who came out of it), and like the villain, I still admire what is a classic rock or a boy rock, and this film about the strange long reunion of Strange Fruit. Is a passionate tribute to those days. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons the film works is to take care of people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson produced what I like to do about Tina Turner (while I was having problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was treated very well), and writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenes co-wrote "Commitments" and were behind them. The British music-oriented OVER THE RAINBOW, and Strange Fruit, co-written by Foreigners Mick Jones (not to be confused with The Clash's Mick Jones), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. In addition, there are two actors who are musicians in and of itself (Bill Nye I do not know about him, although the film is attributed to him in his own singing, and certainly seems to be a major singer in that era, while Jimmy Nayl in another British television program was directed As I said, many of the 1970's like Strange Fruit acted badly against women, but the film does not make the same mistake (except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall); As reunion manager, Juliet Aubrey is very good and plays a completely round personality. <br /> <br /> The actors The others are all good too, with your praise to Steven Rhea, who takes the most dramatic role well without feelings.There are a few plot points not working, but in general this is very enjoyable.Oh yes, the music is very good.
