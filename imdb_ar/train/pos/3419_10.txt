After just "welcoming home" my 23-year-old daughter from Iraq, the medical support unit at Anaconda camp, I felt compelled to get the DVD. I wanted to hear the feelings of other returning veterinarians in order to try to understand their mentality better on arrival and not to wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your position on war and peace, this film is a great start for all Americans to start healing our returning veterinarians. The ultimate statement of the entire film is "Take Action" about the problem. An incredibly passionate film. I highly recommend this vet film to all the mature family members and ask them to follow it up with a plan to listen to the rest to help returnees to the permanent Gulf War. My daughter has seen this DVD. She took into account her emotions and actually committed herself to renewing for another 6 years. Her take the time you spend in the sand is that she did some good. Local children have received first-class medical treatment for various common diseases, which they can not normally get free of charge with an escort and interpreter. Her look over her shoulder in her tour of Iraq was. "We've changed some hearts and minds again" A wonderful DVD should keep your mind open and see all the parties
