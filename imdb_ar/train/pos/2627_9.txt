Finally, Timon and Pumba made their own film ... <br /> <br /> "Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is a new non-stop movie about a classic story. That classic tale, you ask? Why, "Lion King" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing Disney has never lacked, it is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But this does not mean that this is not a good film. It is basically the "Lion King" events as narrated from the perspective of Timon and Bomba. For this reason, you will have to learn the story of "The Lion King" by heart to see where they came from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, at the level of what I was watching and thinking, "My God, this is lame ..." On another level I was having a ball. A lot of humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa forms two beds, one big for himself and one small for Timon, in the first nanos we all know that Timon will take a big race. But this does not prevent him from being Farhana, the IMO, "Hakone Matata" in short. This is not what happens, but how. <br /> <br /> A warning note: There are also some harmful jokes. Seriously, would you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbaa takes center stage? But with the continued jokes fart, these are particularly good, and should satisfy even more privacy experts. <br /> <br /> The talent of sound is fantastic. I was surprised that some of the actors were ready to go back, most of them had only two or three lines (if they were lucky). The Whoopi Goldberg site is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is great too. From "Digga Tunnah" to "This Is All I Need", written by "Warthog Rhapsody" (a song from "The Lion King" and frankly much improved in this incarnation), music leaves me nothing to complain of any kind . <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are great characters, while "Hakuna Matata" is simply a justification for seeing them in varied and entertaining situations. So let it be. It is rare to find characters who just want to spend time with them. <br /> <br /> Did I start to hear a creepy voice? <br /> <br /> Either way, "Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you've seen Lion King many times. Especially if you're thinking now, "Do not be silly, there's nothing like seeing the Lion King several times!"
