Did you know, Anthony Caidys, (singer of Red Hot Chili Peppers) is the father in this film. Blackie Dammit, is the father of Anthony. I noticed this after reading Anthony's biography "Scar Tissue" and I saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, it looks like this guy looks like that guy from that movie I saw in the eighties." Then I read more and said that his father was representing him in some small roles. The film really, it is funny, because nowhere in the book does not remind him that in this film, perhaps his son was ashamed of his father's job in acting in this light, but he does not, I think his father, Blackie, did a wonderful job in the show.
