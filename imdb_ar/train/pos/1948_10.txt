This is a fantastic end to the show. The fact that Admiral Janway was able to do a double shift on the tower. The fact that she allowed herself to be injured, and therefore the queen's injury to the "poison" that ended the essence in Burg was great. The way they ended up also left some, not much, for the reunion film. However, they brought them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Quit it with Tom and Blana with their baby as soon as they enter Alpha Quad. It was a great way to show a fresh start. It would be nice to have a reunion film of some kind - just to see where their characters will be today.
