I rented this movie in DVD format without knowing anything at all, as part of the Winter Marathon to watch a movie every night. After many horrible American adventure films (Ballistic, Dredeville, Cradle of Life), I was shocked by the warriors of the original film industry. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the sincerity of the film and its good intentions and its sudden lack of recovery, and the film looks amazing. Sure, special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but filmgoers are more interested in color, composition and motion than realism and many breathtaking shots. In one shot, two superheroes stand on top of rocky rock towers, a huge moon that stands out before them. The picture is perfectly balanced between the three elements. Elsewhere, the Princess's fight in the sky roams behind her glowing sword like a rocket looking for heat. The colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotions rather than to actually represent. <br /> <br /> Characters have the same simplicity and comprehension of the characters of the comic book, and do not offer much depth in themselves but refer to the types of brackets. Which resonates more deeply. Physically, many actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles straight, without ridicule or guilt, so they are likely. <br /> <br /> More surprisingly, despite the folly of the plot and the high profile, I found myself near to tears in the end, through the simplicity of the beautiful actors and the sincere original vision of the director. <br /> <br />
