Honestly, if someone tells me that the director of the unfortunate series of events in Lemon Snicket and the City of Angels and Caspers would have made a simple low budget low budget movie that would be really good, I would say that person should be joking. But that's what Brad Seberling did. It was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has a similar concept to movies like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or "Once". It involves a chance to meet two people if they do not put them in the shell, they probably will not cross paths, or if they do, they will not say one word to each other. Like those films, "10 Items or Less" focuses on the relationship you build and how characters recognize each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story includes Morgan Freeman, who plays a role in an unnamed actor, goes to look for his role as a grocery manager for an upcoming independent film and because of things beyond his control, ends up spending the day with the lady in 10 or less hot elements played by Paz Vega. She has a corrupt marriage and hopes to get a new job as secretary. At first, Freeman's character only needs to raise the house. After spending time with her, he wants to know her and maybe give her some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds almost entirely the characters through exchanges between Freeman and Vega. This plot is just set up for these two people to interact with each other for over 80 minutes of film. Freeman enjoys his character, as it seems strange in the world of the lower class where the character of Vega, Scarlett. Vega, at the same time, is stepping out of stubborn stubborn writer her anger at the position of her life that looks forward to moving forward. <br /> <br /> There are some things that really figured out in this movie. First of all, Seabrling may have noticed from independent cinema to make sure that the relationship is honest and does not fall into any Hollywood pitfalls. It is a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly during the film. It works, although the position itself seems somewhat impossible. <br /> <br /> I also admire performance. Although Freeman's presence gives this film credibility from the start, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun that is not normally seen. At the same time, Paz Vega is preparing herself for a breakthrough in the American film sometime in the future. I liked it at Spanglish which is just as good as a scarlet hard. Near the end of the film, she successfully navigates her personality. I look forward to seeing her in more films. <br /> <br /> In general, the top 10 elements are best in character, writing and directed by Brad Seabrling. He did not do much writing and his long film career consisted mostly of big Hollywood movies. However, there is definitely an artist at work here, keen to know if he will take this route again.
