Word: suprurrrb! I do not think I've seen anything like this in a long time on the web or cable TV. Watching this show was like breathing fresh air amidst a TV schedule full of realistic displays and boring reruns. <br /> <br /> I must say that I have my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in tears and lowered the level of supply. But when it ended half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running a free trade fair), I was left with a sense of immediate love, love at first sight, true love that one feels in his gut. Everything about this show was excellent. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this presentation were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. The development of the small feat did not take into consideration these films. <br /> <br /> Cast was great. I am part of the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team were definitely on par with John. Special mention: guest appearance Lisa Kudro. She was at the head of the game, making a nervous and fat panda with a Jewish line. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show). <br /> <br /> The script was funny, as there were a lot of internal and adult jokes that were sharp, but not attractive. Note to all parents: This is not for children. This offer is never advertised as such, and there is a reason to set it at 9 pm rather than 8 pm. So, if you'd like to complain about "Denied Context," save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made for them only, and Father of Pride is so. <br /> <br /> Everything was not perfect. I was a bit puzzled by the characters Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel a "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are cheats. Yes, they are inflamed. Yes, they speak German dialects. But this is the news of yesterday. Give us something new, something new, something funny that putting old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" enjoyed by these men. This is good for me. But please do not talk about something that everyone already knows by heart. Hopefully the rest of the show will not play the same old record again and again. <br /> <br /> In general, the TV show is definitely a must. Funny, clever, with some unexpected twists here and there - there has not been a good comedy since Seinfeld. I'm definitely looking forward to the next episode.
