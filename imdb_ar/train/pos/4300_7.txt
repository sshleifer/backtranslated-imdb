Could it have been one of those regular "Saboons" that relate to the daily events of half a dozen families whose life intertwines? .. Broken relationships, build new friendships, street attacks, nearby accidents, hopes and dreams, even the discovery of a child was disposed of under some bushes! What a combination of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond these everyday events and asks questions to look at, although there are no satisfactory answers. Asks? In this chaotic world, things only happen, is it lucky when things turn out right or, if we look at a fatal point of view, a person is destined to be in a certain place at a given time and thus participate in the event and its future takes a new perspective ? Most of us have experienced this strange experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our arrogance that makes us think we are so important? As one character says? He once sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite films but a good study of human relations. Danny Glover is wonderful in a sympathetic role.
