This is a classic favorite. I was filmed in West Philadelphia a little when I was 13 in 1957 and released the following year. Then in 1970, I found myself working in the same province as a rising state soldier in the Palestinian Authority. I have always enjoyed checking out different places where the scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner restaurant well and had a sign in front of the road telling all the passing motorists that this was a "house of bullets". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and still showing movies today!
