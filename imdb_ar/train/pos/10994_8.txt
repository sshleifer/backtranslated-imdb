This is my first comment! This is a great movie! I watched everything through luck one night on TV. In the first five minutes I thought it was a B movie, but then I understood a great product. <br /> <br /> I suggested to some friends watching the movie, just to let me know that it was a bad movie. How wrong. Surface criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius product! The famous manager did an excellent job here, and it's a shame to tell him he was out of the game all this time.
