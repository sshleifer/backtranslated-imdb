I just want all the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Turgov is my uncle and I am very proud of him. This mini-series that appears in VH1 is a great look at the drug culture over the past 30 years, and my uncle has worked hard on it. The amount of time and effort I have seen is placed in this documentary, and the book that started everything (can not find my way home) makes watching it on TV much better. I know he likes what he does and he does it well. His report appears in his own interviews and the amazing additions he adds to the commentary. From music to video clips and everything else, this is a great documentary that truly shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I appreciate any comments on it from those who enjoyed it (or did not) and I love to hear from fans! Three cheers for Martin's uncle!
