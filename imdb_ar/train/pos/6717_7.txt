This documentary was very subtle and revealing, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was somewhat impressive. I felt as if they had done a very good job covering the sport from its origin to the present day, but nevertheless, there is a reason not to give high grade to this film ... <br /> It felt as though the story sometimes focused more than On the "correct names" of the sport, so to speak: a lot on the individual sites that can be browsed, especially individual browsers. It felt as if the documentary had a greater connection to the nature of sport, the ideology of the sport, and so on. It was better (although this was covered of course, I do not think it got as much time as it takes). <br /> <br /> For many people who are not familiar with browsing, sometimes they hear and continue in specific places and can become certain boring surfers. Although the videos and in-depth research are highly respected, it could have been better presented to those who are not thirsty skiers. <br /> <br /> Moreover, my greatest disappointment at times was to talk about the amazing and miraculous miracle events in the history of surfing, but they did not have the actual footage of these unfolding events, and all the time you were waiting to see on the screen Silver This amazing and impressive event speaks to men about the changing moments of life, and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about, not real footage. It was very sad for me to hear these stories, so I would not be able to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting shots for everything, but please: do not take too much pride in the event, then do not show it. <br /> <br /> In general, a new documentary I enjoyed watching; not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but being very refreshed and has some very interesting footage and good soundtrack, a documentary I recommend everyone to check out.
