I admit, the first time I saw where the cowboys get the blues, I did not think it was unforgettable in any area. But now after seeing him the seventh time, I admit that he grew up on me a lot. The characters of Cisse, Mrs. Giliban and the Countess became very popular. The romance between Sisi and Jellybean looks very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor is more than compensating. Then there is the soundtrack of the kick that is characterized by K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at its best. I can not think of any film "grew on me" after the first disastrous impression, as in Cowgirls.
