As with all other reviewers, this film was fixed in my mind 30 years later. I remember going to the library to look at all I could do in this story. So I wrote to the PBS station for more information. All the same, all I knew was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> Fastward to 2002, after years of searching for Ebay's weekly basis there was a VHS version of the film. There was one other bidders but I was determined to win this movie. The loser wrote to me asking for a copy of it. Despite owning a copy, I'm still looking and finally searched for a site that sold a copy of the DVD to the movie.
