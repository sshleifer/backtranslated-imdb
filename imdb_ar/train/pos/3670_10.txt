I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and while I'm about to study filmmaking in Canada from all places, I'll certainly bring this up in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The story, which focused on the most fortunate film team in the history of the film itself, was brilliantly written and highly talented actors managed to present every punched game on time. <br /> <br /> If you can not laugh simply during "Hollywood North" "I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> Along with the wonderful text, I also noticed the wonderful chemistry among the actors Deborah Kara-Anger and Matthew Moden - where they really act? Jennifer Tilly (playing a very bad actress) and Martin Landau, also made a very exciting and funny show. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie, even best reps.
