It may not be the best film of 2006, but it was just a film that intrigues him. Sentinel is a good political thriller that looks similar or even borrowed some elements from other political thrillers such as In the Line Fire and the Manshurian candidate. The main plot of this film is similar to other films such as: A Plot to Kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the role of Secret Service agent Beth Garrison, who leads the operation only to learn later that he was framed. Kiefer Sutherland is participating in the starring competition as David Breckenridge and Eva Longoria as Gil Marin as agent under the supervision of Under-Secretary Breckenridge, Academy Award winner Kim Basinger and First Lady Sarah Palentin. One of the improvements to this film could have been more work because it is by some sources that action film is as much a thriller but the good thing about this film is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the US president, President in the wrong direction.
