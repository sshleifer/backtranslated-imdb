David Duchovny plays a key role in this film. Now, many people will not find it difficult to watch. It is too unfair to say as few as possible. David has set up his name on x files and is a good actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict who has been suspended for malpractice. It is just an accident that he becomes a special doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is interested in using "Eugene" in a blues ambush. Angelina Jolie plays a supporting role for both gangsters in Claire. It delivers strong performance. Timothy Hutton plays a wonderful blossom and immerses himself deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people think, and in the end he performed his credibility. His familiar tone and straight face exist but did not detract much from the film
