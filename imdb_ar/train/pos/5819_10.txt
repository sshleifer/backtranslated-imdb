I liked this movie since it first appeared. I was about nine years old and now I am 27 years old. I remember playing a video game on Sega Genisis. I enjoyed a lot, I would like to show my son this film. Michael Jackson also likes and I know he will love this movie just as I was when I was a kid. Although it is much smaller than I was when I first saw it. I can not wait until I come out on a DVD! Hope to come out on DVD! Please let it out on DVD! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well, that's my comment, I hope that someday, I'll be able to watch this movie again. I like all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini video is Badder!
