I loved this movie from the opening series until the end. I found that the Direct / Direct approach of the director / actor in my address was very attractive. <br /> <br /> What I found more exciting and refreshing about this film is its disregard - and then challenge - of gender stereotypes and class. The specifics of characters are portrayed as strengths, the absence of judgment - and the acceptance of personalities for themselves and each other - enabled me to embrace them and allow me to attract to their world. Without this preaching, with intelligence and pleasant humor and love, this film has the potential to open us up to new possibilities and provide hope for a world where people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I am looking forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
