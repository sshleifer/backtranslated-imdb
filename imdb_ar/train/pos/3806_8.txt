This film took my breath away at some points, I loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that it was possible to conduct character dialogues and tell the story a bit better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story for two people trying to kill a dragon, there's nothing more to it! <br /> <br /> The overall design, atmosphere and beautiful landscapes ... all are just magic! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this movie. The designs of the characters were wonderful and funny. Little Tim Burton nest if you like. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a great design, presented in a simple yet beautiful story.
