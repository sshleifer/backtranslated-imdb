Pride's father is pleasantly surprised: he is funny, intelligent, and has some wonderful voice acting. The show revolves around a lion family that plays the role of Siegfried and Roy. Actually all these stereotypes but that's what makes them funny. FOTP is not a cartoon of children, it includes some adult humor but in a very light way. It is full of popculture references and famous celebrities and most of them are performed very well. I would say that I will introduce the program 7 out of ten because it is well executed but not very original, I have seen most of these stereotypes several times before, even in this specific order!
