This film, invented by critics at the time but popularly loved by the fans, has become a classic. "Surreal" shots are supposed to be mixed in John Lennon's house among other places with live footage of Mark Bolan and Trix at their best, and this film is not only a necessity for everyone who loves Mark Bolan but gives a great look to the age. <br /> <br /> These were the times when Mark was thrilled with the likes of Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed him] and you can even find a short spot from one of Reg Dwight [Elton John Elleek] ivory elements in an amazing version [ Officially] from Tutti Frutti and Vibrator versions and songs from The Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes featuring Chelita Secunda [said to have "created a wonderful rock with the use of glitter etc.], Mickey Vin and even the actor from Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is the When Mark leaves the dining table, sits cross-sectioned in front of a string clip and knocks on audio versions of Classics such as Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Highly recommended !! Five Stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
