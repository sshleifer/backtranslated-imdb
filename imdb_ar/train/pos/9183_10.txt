This brilliant television production by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1983 (not a film, as others have written here) is the classic love story Jane Eyre, starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zilla Clark as Jane, Prepared yet, he is the most faithful to the novel of Charlotte Bronte in terms of concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Classic becomes classic for very specific reasons; when film producers begin to interfere with the classical lifeline, this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, Jane Eyre's producers approached the story with respect and sincerity towards the original, resulting in a wonderful addict who is worth watching several times to enjoy his many layers of sweetness, joy and suspense. The performances are exhilarating, the music is just right, so is the Gothic design of the house and the beautiful outdoor footage, and the correct tone set for production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, though minor, is that this version, like every other version of Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's personality and influenced her moral choices. In today's contemporary world, a woman will not think of putting Jane twice to stay with Rochester after she discovered that he had a crazy wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just get a divorce," she would say to her husband, or will live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she could not accept this cycle in life and respected herself. why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith that she had taught since childhood, not from the brutal Calvinism Institute of Ludin, but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred instead of the heart of her other cheek. One day, I would like to see a version that depicts these effects a bit more in adaptation. A classic novel ends with heroic writing "However, come, Lord Jesus!" It should not have the foundations of this faith stripped of it.
