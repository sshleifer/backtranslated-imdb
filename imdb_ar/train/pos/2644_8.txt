I do not know what I find interesting for this film, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a fan of Paul Winfield nor a war drama, but I was really wondering how and when Winfield would find his baby. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Tell me the truth that I have not seen this movie in years and has not been on television for some time, but this film is somewhat the journey of one man after the pain of war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and warm-hearted image of a man who has lost his memories. There is a key message in this film that he is looking for the last bells of human morality in the wake of this war and the reality he faces. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
