Now, I saw a lot of movies in my day, but out of every one there was a few films that were very good for me. I am a 19-year-old man who was impressed by this film directed at a younger audience. This is a very underestimated gem for those who watch foreign films. All the actions are almost believable, the graphics are appropriate (and you will not be interested in them while watching the movie.) Trust me, the bitch about the graphics will be stupid), the story is well written, it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not only children. <br /> <br /> Here's what made me this movie. It's one, made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel like you, and three, it's a very upscale story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what anime there did not show some little kid turns into a great warrior and anything to defeat some great evil. It is a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case, it can be forgiven because, although they use puppets for some characters and some medium drawings you see five years ago, their appearance should not be judged. It is very moving, and the ending is original, and keeps you in the movie as supposed. If you're trying to compare it to other movies like "The Endless Story" or anything that will diversify your opinion. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It has been a long time since I was so impressed. The only other film in which I gained this feeling is when I saw TMNT on his way back when he came out. There is something about this film I felt about TMNT that made me really love it. So do not over-analyze this movie or take it seriously, just enjoy it.
