This early version of the Prague student story was released in 1913, starring Paul Figner (who was also in The Golem a few years later). The film plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see it in the same shot) after an obscure old man who makes a gold deal - the gold he needs to attract the previously held Countess saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a rapid pace (the film lasts just over an hour) and written and somewhat distinctive, "Prague student" echoes the legend of Faust as well as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting as with an agreement with a mysterious character From potential evil, and evolution to the good and evil aspects of the same person.
