When watching how the brothers interact and feed each other through the entire film, I am personally happy to live in rural areas as he did in the film. I have watched this movie countless times and get the book next to my Bible. After watching the film, I agree that this is one of the few films that bring justice to the book. I highly recommend anyone who has the chance to go to Montana for fishing or to be outdoors to do so. It is a nice. I can not think of anyone else who could play a better role than Brad Pitt. Enjoy justice and watch one of the best films in the era of modern cinema. Highly recommend and as a guide to fishing trips in both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish from movie scenes because although it looks great in the movie, you have no idea how much practice and hunting skills such a take actually takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie please if you want a sad long movie.
