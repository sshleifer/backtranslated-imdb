I was very surprised when I saw this movie too distracted ... I understand why some of you dislike this movie. The pace is slow, a feature of Japanese movies. However, if you are absorbed in a movie like me, you will find that this is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Are we Dansu?" Often considered a Japanese comic masterpiece. It's quite different from Hollywood movies, for example Austin Powers or scary movies, where a gag is guaranteed every few minutes. Instead, it's light, it's a movie that makes you feel comfortable. <br /> <br /> I like the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is clear and fun. I was pleased to see Sugiyama (the main role) and found the meaning of life in dance. Before I saw the film, I was a bit depressed by the heavy schoolwork. I felt lost, but this film made me think of the bright side of life. I thought I was in Sugiyama's own boat; if he could find himself in his hobby, why could not I? Remind me to "explore my own future" and discover happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find that the dance scenes are not as perfect as you would expect, I loved them because that makes me feel that the characters are really "lively", where I learn to dance with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this film is heart-warming and encouraging. As a comedian, she does her work perfectly. It is definitely worth 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Yes, Oki is funny: -D
