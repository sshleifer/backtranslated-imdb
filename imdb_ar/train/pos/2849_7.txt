I can not say that this film is disappointing because I read some reviews before watching and it did not happen as I thought it would. The tape was not loud, so the fact that my expectations were met did not mean much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The New York city. If you live in a city like me, you'll get to know certain places and you'll understand that the city is supposed to be more than just an ocean, but one of the main characters. There are truly thin moments, funny conversations, and left and right distortions, making all things interesting. <br /> <br /> Bad: The first thing I thought about after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not the positive "let them want more" fashion. Surely good storytelling / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are a lot of short stories that fall into the "inner" category, many of them in fact, which eventually leads to a drop in the film. Also, diversity in New York City, although it is suggested that many of the distant pans of the city mentioned in the conversation during the film, was not really understood or analyzed to the extent of justice in the city. For example, many plays involve well-done mid-aged eggs. I mean, I know that the city is home to many demographics but come, the Jeitai Paris plot and the diversity of its characters make New York City look like Lancaster or Pennsylvania or any really white place. It is disappointing to see the city summarize its heritage as such. <br /> <br /> However, even after I said this, I recommend giving a New York view, I love you. Who knows, maybe will not agree with my opinion and probably will not. You will never know until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to deter anyone from viewing this film, as everyone's opinion is different in art. I just give you very vague heads about what to expect.
