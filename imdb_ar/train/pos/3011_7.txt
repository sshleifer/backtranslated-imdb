One of Vance's best films succeeds more in an interesting plot and shrewd direction by nothing but Michael Cortez. At this time, a publicly hated financier - dead in his head - was found in his closed bedroom and upstairs. Philo Vance, hearing about the situation as he is about to leave for Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is murder and what others think of suicide. William Powell is Philo Vance as gentle as you will find. He does not seem to always press very smoothly what he says and does. Powell helps a group of very talented actors - some actors and actresses of the first order, such as Mary Astor as one of her daughters who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as secretary of the dead man, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog lover, Arthur Hall kept the mysterious servants, Helen Finson, Two good performances by James Lee as a Chinese cook and Porte Eugene Pallet as a wise police informant. Add to this mix a wonderful twist from Etienne Gerardot, where the forensic doctor always loses his meal. This is the depth of the suspects and the story, which contains a lot of intrigues and turns that make the "murder of the House of Death" a fast-moving and enjoyable mystery.
