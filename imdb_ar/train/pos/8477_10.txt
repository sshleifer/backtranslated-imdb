In a non-traditional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> It was one of my favorites when I was a little girl, and I remembered that recently, and I thought of looking for it. Although a lot of details are no longer clear in my mind, only the general feeling that the film has given me has hung over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can deal with mature and sometimes violent subjects, then strongly recommend this film. She taught me a lot about life and death, and made me feel so much. To this day, one of my favorite movies remains.
