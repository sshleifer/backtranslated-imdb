I was watching this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking to my wife in law at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to her? I saw a little that her husband was hearing that someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, she had already died. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? Did you kill herself? How could she arrange everything like phone calls and at the same time she was at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain me, please. I'm very curious! (In the end, I read that she suffered a personality disorder beating). <br /> <br /> Thnks before.
