I've only seen this recently but I've been familiar with it for several years now, and I've always been fascinated by his surname. He now belongs to me as one of my most favorite films. It's hard to describe the amazing subject that Michelles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It contains many memorable pictures and moments where you feel you are going beyond a very special world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It seems as though the directors cast a wave of audience and attracted us to a strange world of eccentric bellies, a real aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be away from it all, and cooking an atom on a piece of bread on my bedside table. He has an atmosphere of sadness that permeates all over. Fall of greatness to this respectable family once. The money went but the air stayed and yes, as well as its beauty. It attracted me from the first frame and long after the film ended, I found myself wondering about their fate. I wonder if if you take a stroll along East Hampton Beach, I may hear Old Eddie's voice at night and watch a little Eddie silhouette dance in the window behind the thick suspended crawler. never forget.
