I first saw this miniature series several years ago on British television, and immediately pleased with the story. It surprised me a lot because I'm not a fan of the music of Jane Eyre or the Wethering Heights; I consider the first heroine to be an embodiment of the self, and the last part of the work was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the above works, is also somewhat depressing in parts. However, the darker parts of the film were compensated by the excitement of Helen's escape, beautiful scenic landscapes in Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stevens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully depicts the frustrated, restricted lifestyle. All the women at the time. At best, suffered from a form of simple domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of women in the Markham family. At the other end of the scale, there is an unfortunate Helen married to a rich man of high estate, but subjected to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. She ran away and faced a brief moment of freedom, but, as a woman of mystery living alone in a rural society, she inevitably became the subject of sharp gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as long as Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (though that hairstyle is awesome) with amazing cheek bones, they are also more than able to play the central role in the film. Tara is gracious and isolated, and at the same time, allows us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Robert Graves is Arthur Huntingdon, who is stunning, but very attractive - after seeing him, I never imagined there would be another actor playing this part. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention of her role as a limp Gilbert mother, as well as an actress who played the role of his sister Rose, and Simon Carter who is an immutable vicar with a taste of good things in life. Finally, I can watch this movie for Toby Stevens alone; it's sensitive-looking, rugged, sexy, and sensitive (but not emotionally nauseous). I'm not sure if he is a good representative because Hormone prevents me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake in the film it is the use of memories of the past that I felt interfere with the flow of the story and made it a bit confusing. Other people, who watched this movie with me, also had problems, and I found that I had to make it clear to them that some of the scenes were actually retroactive. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to the people responsible for making this movie. Not only was the video showing (which was rare), but it prompted me to buy Anne Brunate's wonderful novel. Of course, this was better than the film, but by a narrow margin. I recommend anyone interested in watching the movie and then reading the book in this order. <br /> <br />
