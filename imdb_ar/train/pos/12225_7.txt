I saw this film, and although I knew who was the killer from the start, I still love watching it. I would recommend it to other people. It's about the Lifetime movie network. I think it's close to Halloween, and they may play it more. So please see it if you are interested in watching it. I think Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really love her as an actress and someone. It looks very nice and modest. Kevin Dillon has been performing well for me. I do not try to knock him or anything, but I think his brother Matt was able to attract this serial killer better. Kevin seems very sweet to me. But I think it's fine.
