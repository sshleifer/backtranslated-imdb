For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of Alpha's most powerful men filmed on the big screen. He is a decent enough young man to leave his parents' home and hit the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him working in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, it was the beginning of the boom and Texas was certainly a growing place in the USA. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job of making our audience care about his character and who when he returns to this place is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Deborah Wenger from the same background, but has some ideas that women should not be silhouetted by their men. When you beat him in the mechanical bull of Gilley, a man's game, that's the thing for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn is the former convict in Gilley's and this film is his unique role. He is a real snake in the Urban Cowboy, and gets the Travolta goat as soon as he takes a look and moves in the wing. Travolta in turn deals with a rich girl, Madolin Smith Osborne shaking in Giles. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, the Urban Cowboy was truly a huge commercial advertisement for the world's largest self-designed tunici. Giles is no longer in the Pasadena community in Texas, but the memories are still alive. The best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful result of the rural / western songs that appeared in the film. I'm not sure if some songs were not specifically written for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason why I'm thinking why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I liked the message John Lee Lee's For Love, especially if it was written specifically for this film, it is a shame that he was not nominated for the Best Song Award. <br /> <br /> I liked Debra Wenger's best character in this film. She does not lose the effect of femininity, but she stands in the face of Travolta and does so elegantly. This review is dedicated to those women who are not yet known, and who will one day be the first woman to tour the professional bull race.
