Let me start by saying that "War, INC" is not a cup of tea for everyone. However, they are very fun (and make you think - "Oh, crap"). The comedy that took part in the film is not clear at all - it is completely hidden (caskets, dry cleaning service, etc.), and changes with twists and turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> I may be only one, but I will not compare this with "Grosse Point Blank", because it is different. John Kozak - I would not say it was "amazing" or "wonderful" - but it was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Kozak) was amazing in presenting her lines and comedy timing - although she was barely in the film (I say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tome plays a persuasive reporter and was able to pull him out. Hilary Duff is commendable for her role as pop star in Central Asia, Unica Peppia. Duff's development is a very prominent actress in the film, and she does a very good job (although her tone is not true). <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is what I call "amusing." It does not have a particular story, which is sometimes very silly, but has a hidden message. I would say it is worth watching.
