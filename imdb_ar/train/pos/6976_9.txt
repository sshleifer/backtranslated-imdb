I did not see the BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but could not get into it. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday I felt a bit lost, so I decided to watch Pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising proposition and the only side effect that I have made is that I now want to watch BSG as well. <br /> <br /> But what I really liked is that I did not have to be BSG hardcore to understand what was going on in Caprica. From what I read in the network, they have been trying to reach the female population since the arrival of the BSG to a larger number of men, at least in my case. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you are trying to view the demo, do so from the beginning starting with the demo program.
