The history of the FBI, as recounted from Stewart's point of view by past memories, overlaps with his personal life story. Stuart and Miles (as his wife) are good, as is Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the incidental nature of the story makes it difficult to participate. It's like watching parts and pieces of dozens of different films where we get a glimpse of who's looking at gangsters. Some episodes are very long, some are very short, others are seen out of place (Stewart's daughter school sequence). In general, it goes on too long. However, it is worth searching for the values ​​of its handsome production.
