The Oscar-winning film was released two years before its birth, and boasts a range of luxurious elegance, art, cinematic cinematography, exquisite wall-to-wall music, ultra-high-definition dance design, lighter air show and cool shows like Kelly, Levant, Fuchs, Gucci and Karon. Hollywood does not make like this anymore. Sure, this is my favorite film of all time, and it is the standard that is judged in all other films. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!
