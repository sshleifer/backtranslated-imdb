I'm sitting here November 2006 and still can not rave about this movie. Arnold's best films came in about 4-5 years. Man Run, Predator, and Total Recall (1990). All 3 amazing. Arnold's linens in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. I find acting in this film surprisingly good, as was the case with Predator and Total Recoil. They've done a great job trying to make the viewer futuristic because it's supposed to be done in 2017, but you can only hang out in the 80's haircut on the men and women in the crowd and the regular TV screens at The Man Man studio, which we all know here in 2006. The way out with the appearance of flat panel and HDTV devices. The computer graphics presented in the introduction to the game "The Running Man" will not appear in 2017. However, the story is very impressive. I did not want to wake up once during this film, and I do not care about the result, and this is something I do a lot with today's movies. I really think that Arnold's behavior is much better than what he enjoys. Now I did not elect him as governor, but this is California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are great "stalkers" too, and I find that producers are not trying to over-combat scenes. When the stalker died ... he died. Do not last for 20 minutes each. The appendage scenes are quick and entertaining but do not try to overestimate them. I give this movie 10/10 which comes from someone who does not enjoy a lot of movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the future graphic presentations you see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
