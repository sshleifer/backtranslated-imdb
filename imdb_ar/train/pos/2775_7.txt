Old-time movie buffs will know why this guy is named "The Man in the Gray Flannel Robe". Most of the films based on the Bible are basically kicks - what might be called smiles and laughter here is how Peck tries to raise awareness about a variety of psychosocial issues with a spear that carries the primitive human being all about him. As great romance, it falls like yeast-free bread. But there is something about this film. Among all the great evangelical Hollywood images, it conveys strikingly the paradoxical position of the average American towards faith in biblical God. Billy Sunday's thesis is based on H.L. Mencken throughout the text. Who gets the best of the synthesis supported by heavenly paradise depends on your point of view. Other than that, D & B has a good performance by Peck (especially in the scene of final repentance) and Gene Meadows as his first bitter wife Michol, a lively and moody atmosphere (a good idea to put most of the events at dawn or night), the loud delivery of the 23rd Psalm in the end.
