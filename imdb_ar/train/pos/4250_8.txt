Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most well-known short film, has a strange sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads. What the film revolves around in essence, and certainly will disagree with me on this subject, is how a regular atmosphere of trust finds life with little inspiration. or not. You just have to see for yourself. The game is an intermittent tour of the festival circuit, so keep your eyes peeled and enjoy it if you can - you'll be happy with it. It's hilarious. Check out Todd's other short films that have appeared here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
