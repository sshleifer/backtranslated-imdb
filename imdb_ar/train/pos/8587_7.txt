My Take: Take advantage of its familiar layout with great shows and a few real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man was framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the United States, the first traitor in the United States Secret Service. While being pursued by fellow secret agents, is trying to prove his innocence. Of course we know his innocents, the real culprit is just around the corner, but I still enjoy the Sentil. At this time when the excitement is shortened to be very ironic in the sequence of events, The Sentinel is a good reference to all the old good political crime films. The familiar plot is upgraded through exciting sequences and great shows. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for this post, is the long-serving Secret Service agent, House Beth Garrison, who was framed for being part of a conspiracy to assassinate the president. His former colleagues in the Secret Service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing Harrison as he tries to find out who is behind the potential assassination and the traitor in secret service. This leads to a lot of chase scenes which, amazingly (thankfully), are unbelievable. The screenplay also presents a sub-story of Garrison, who has an affair with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not necessary as for most sub-schemes for these types of films. <br /> <br /> The film director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T) who makes the film look good. Although many criticized him as "it should have been a television movie," but I do not agree. This is not an ideal film, much of it inspired by thrillers and other political intrigues such as The Line of FIRE or Episode 24 of the TV series (similar to Sutherland). However, Conspiring to dangerous levels and not giving up its smaller details. The presentations are fantastic (with the best reps, be sure to be, even with the script by the numbers. <br /> <br /> All in all, I appreciate it 1/2 ***, not perfect, but not far away from them. < br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
