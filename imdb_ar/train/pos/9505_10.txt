This is a really wonderful and loving film! The locations of the Ripstein are spectacular, very detailed and well lit, and the dialogue is Garcia Marquez exceptionally, no doubt about it. Fernando Logan and Marissa Paredes perform prominently as a colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You should see it !!!
