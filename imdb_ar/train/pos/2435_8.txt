I never thought that the old cartoon will bring tears to my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted to see the first Casper cartoon titled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the following animation, there was Good Boos To-Night (1948), It made me crumble! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing the Caspar fox killed! I have never seen anything like this in other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest one of all! It was very frustrating, and I could not see it again. It is just like seeing Lacy die at the end of the film. I know it's classic, but we like it a lot for old animation fans! If you want to see something old and classic, I'd rather watch something fun and funny! But when I think of this Casper cartoon, I think of my cat!
