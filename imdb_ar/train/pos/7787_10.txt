This film captures the essence of your growing up in a small town in America for a young girl on her own. Realism and nuances, presented to Ashley Jude's character, Ruby, through the story, capture what can only be described as a real reality in Florida's life. From the echoes of the screen door, to the lack of action, the echoes of what life really looks like on the Red Neck Riviera are tough options for the little girl. Paradise did not come easy. But she slowly overcomes the obstacles and deception, and learn to be her woman, with the power flowing from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile, Infectious Walk salutes warmth, respect and admiration. The pace of Ulee's Gold is similar in 1997, starring Peter Fonda and directed by Victor Nunez.
