... probably the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). Besides one great fan service for the fan girls (well, that was plus ~), the story was that blew me away. Hey Hala to Takisa Ziz and Jake! I know some people will disagree with me about this, but none of the top three players (the guys who played Sho, son and Kei) were the ones who performed best (for me, anyway). It was Yamamoto Taro, the No. 5 boy of the Royal Battle! <br /> <br /> Do not get me, I love Hyde, I worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes had stopped a bit, but I loved this scene where the dance of dead man's body killed other men. And Gackt was not that bad at all, preferring how his character was apart from the start. I can not say anything about my background on Lee Hom Wang, I would not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the starry star crew. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best forms of collaboration I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (Sameh Hatey if it's wrong). While the full song lasts about nine minutes, you will not notice the length because you will enjoy listening to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film has to be seen not only for fans (fan base ~) but for those who enjoy science fiction, futuristic films and Asian style.
