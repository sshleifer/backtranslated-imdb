When the Chamberlain family is near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her child being dragged from their tent by Dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should try. Because the Dingo story does not seem to be believed by the public or the press, and it turns into a circus. Lindy does not help things either because she will not play in front of the jury or the courtroom, which is the same only, which is difficult to implement, so of course everyone thinks she is guilty because there is no evidence yet to come. Sam Neil is as excellent as Michael Chamberlain, Seventh Day Adventist, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are as biased and stupid as they are in the United States as well, because the Australian public does not think the story and the media are just burning. In the end, Lindy was convicted and sent to prison throughout the hard work, but years later, missing evidence emerged and was released, but not even after the family's life was fundamentally destroyed. The story of a heart crash, well done, is a bit long but worth seeing. 8 of 10.
