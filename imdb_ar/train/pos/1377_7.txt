In the areas where they overlap with this wonderful film, before 2004 a light patent, which gave the impression of the existence of a Roman eye and breathe young girls. Here the effect is more realistic and becomes inside the heads of the three protagonists as they stumble on their way during a teenage period filled with pitfalls. The three directors, all of whom are unknown to me, offer very definite performances, the genre, in fact, which may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to repeat this kind of acting in other films so as not to surprise me much if they are not heard again. It would be nice if this could get away from Art Houses and Multiplexes where there is only an external opportunity to "talk" to a crowd that is not meant for him.
