Of all Disney Princess stories there, Cinderella is likely to enjoy the most lasting appeal. I can not really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation is pushed to the top of their lists. As a little girl, I did not want more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper - that was my favorite outfit. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not think there is any story more aware of the longing of the human heart than Cinderella. Who never wanted to escape from the bruises of everyday life and find someone you saw you had never seen before? The story is older than English and is still fairly correct. <br /> <br /> For characters, if there is nothing else, Disney can make a great evil. Mrs. Tremaine sinister to T, in a wonderful mathematical way, not in a physical way. Her tongue is cut and her eyes are working for her, she does not need a crew of lightning to raise fear in your heart. Friends of the animal tend to grate, especially that stupid Goss. I would have been delighted if he had met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella itself was not an easy task, making some simple observations sometimes. However, the engine was just lacking to make it completely sympathetic. She was certainly a nice animal and fed her, but what was she doing there? We never know. Even if she becomes a maid only in another house, at least she is paid and received a lead of respect. The only reason Cindy's success seems to be that everything is in her lap. She never works for her dreams that she sings with pride. <br /> <br /> This brings me to music, a wonderful music, as it always has been. Eileen Woods enjoys a beautiful and rich voice, and perhaps my favorite Disney hero. Some great standards have arisen here - "A dream is a wish made by your heart, so this is love, a peppide ..." <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful story filled with music, while lacking some character enhancements, If you feel nauseous in the heart, install it, you will install it and make you charge Mmm Mmm good! <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> - Surprise! Surprise! -Du duh duh- Happy Birthday!
