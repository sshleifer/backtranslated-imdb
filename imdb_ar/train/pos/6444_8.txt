The line, of course, is from the Lord's Prayer - "Thy will be made on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, especially in the far north, is not my idea of ​​the winter temperatures of -30 ° C on the underside for me, but the good people who live there are no doubt that they are in the country of God. <br /> <br /> The story here is a familiar story. The famous international musician Daniel suffers from a healthy collapse in the middle of his career, and returns to the small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Convinced of the local pastor to help the church choir, it converts some unweighted talent into collective action, and they compete in Austria's Innsbruck competition. There are echoes (sorry) of the "Brassed Off" bands of "Calendar Girls" and "Full Monty" dancers. But of course it causes a lot of emotional upheaval as some of the more troubled villagers are aware of their resurgence and rebellion against the oppressed. He faces increasingly hostile and patronized pairs, but nothing but death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the lively story, we recognize and know many characters like people who come across people rather than cartoons, although many of them are recognizable. Did not I wonder about infidelity that has not been punished for a long time? Sweden is one country in the world where such violence has been severely thwarted (he was also a young man who was one of Daniel's youthful screams). <br /> <br /> Michael Nickfest is as wonderful as Daniel, the weak but paid musician, and there is some nice music too, I've been up for two full hours, I think the end is what you make of it, but it does not spoil to say that Daniel achieves what He started to do.
