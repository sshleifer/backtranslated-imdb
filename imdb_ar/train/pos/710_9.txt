Although I do not agree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up Jesse, and this is something I never did, they were trying to do better for the child. The way this film is written, you see yourself in the midst of the story and ask yourself what you really think, from all different sides. Patty Duke? Discount? Almost unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the film, you are really convinced that it is psychotic, or at least that there is something wrong with it. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The film seems to end quickly, leaving some things unresolved. But otherwise, this film is really wonderful. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to relax and relax and watch a nice thing make you laugh. But it's good to see what you want when you challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and discover something small about yourself. Warning: You may grow up while watching this movie! It is worth it in the end.
