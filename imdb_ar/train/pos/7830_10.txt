In "Die Nipplingen: Siegfried", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Karimhead seeks revenge. Married to Hagen, and through a series of events, eventually engage in a very radical (but appropriate) action in the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at some portrayals. Attila the Hun (Etzel in the film) appears as a stranger from the East, and may be a reference to the Soviet Union. It is clear that it was not Fritz Lange's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the FÃ¼hrer liked about the story. However, this is a very phenomenal film.
