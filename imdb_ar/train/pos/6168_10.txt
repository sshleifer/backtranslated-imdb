Elaine Gonzalez, my friend, in this film plays the role of secretary in the main personal bank. It has a lovely view with Seth Roshan in the restaurant. There is more information on her website> After showing my personal interest in the film, I must say that I think it is a beautiful film - moving, funny and beautifully photographed.
