Ineligible "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film reminds us of the best "old" Hollywood movies. Sam Neil and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neil matches Streep line for line, and takes it - it is one of the best exhibitions so far of his wonderful acting talent and is at his best sexy and wonderful, despite the intensity of his role. This innovative film is fun for any filmgoer who loves an exciting drama for the courtroom, filmed in the most humane but unemotional terms. The film - which has won many major awards in Australia - is not only proud of an outstanding director and director, but also a great Australian citizen. It proves that people are themselves all over the world. After all these years, people are still happy to repeat the famous Streep line, accent and everything: "The Dingo has eaten a little baby!" Including "Ellen Pennes" imp on "Seinfeld".
