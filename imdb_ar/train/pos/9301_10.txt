I originally saw this very dark comedy in about 2000 or so on cable TV. What a surprise and a joy! Everyone is secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays a "mental" don (remember Don in New York who was supposed to have schizophrenia? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Parkin are the nicest and not to play with them! Thus proving that beauty and hardness do not go hand in hand! Then there is a wonderful "nonsense" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they play verbally outside the world "nonsense". This film is both subtle and bald. For all photography operations, it can be a very quiet film. You have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or close roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It is not a film for everyone. But, if you love a movie that contains a lot of words and continues to move without blowing everything in sight, this is the right movie for you. Roger Ebert dumps on this film. It's flat wrong. This is a good and beautiful film! Probably not just for Ibert. I consider it 10 because of the quality of its work and how funny the script is, while not actually being a direct comedy. I liked it so well that I bought it on a DVD because it does not show much on cable TV. Now, everything to me!
