FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You should not expect credibility with the movies of the movement where the superhero has to perform an endless series of unbelievable exploits, perseverance in this process, but recovery at lightning speed, and the conversion of non-lethal weapons to deadly weapons. Especially when directed by Renny Harlin. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. The film has many assets: spectacularly photographed scenes, stunning visual effects (the first five minutes sweeping and giving the tone of the film), excellent musical score, welcome attempts to ease stress, and solid actors: two heroes (Stallone, (cowardly, having the lion's share of the footage, but the most excellent Michael Rooker standing on the ground), Janine Turner, and one of the most wicked of a handful of villains ever (the priceless John Lago and the deceptively feminine Caroline Gudal, Rex Lane - in a longer-than-usual part that benefits him to the limit, Leon, Craig Feerb Ras) good and strong entertainment, if there is no credibility. Roger Ebert (on another film) wrote: "It's the kind of movie you can sit and enjoy as long as you do not miss thinking too much." <br /> <br />
