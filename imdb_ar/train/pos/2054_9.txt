When I first heard the title, I thought of the Simpsons, just like many other reviewers, but when I saw the actors, I was so startled that so many great actors would actually be in this! First of all, we have Christopher Dekel (Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain. He was rescued from a Vietnam POW camp by some of his comrades, one of whom is Chick Vennera (Yanks), who divides Bill Doller with McBain (allegedly loading the Vietnam soldiers with money) and tells him that he can restore his favor if he encounters any Problem. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Ran Man, Predator 2) joined the rebels in Colombia in an attempt to get rid of their evil dictator El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos failed in the mission, Christina went to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain asks fellow Vietnam comrades to help him. First, there is the strong black man, Eastland, played by Steve James the American, who was also in the role of director James Glikenhaus former "pesticide", where the name of the real pesticide is also Eastland, by chance? I do not think so. There are also lots of other references to The Exterminator, among other things, most notably that McBain himself wears a welding mask when Christina sees him for the first time, when he works on a welding job on a bridgehead! <br /> <br /> Other people in the Vietnam package are: the rich man who can carry all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recycle, Starship Troppers), and then there's the document. Dalton (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like the guy IMDb is associated with, and I have not seen him in other films, and who knows). Last but not least, there's the cop, Gill, who had enough of his unsatisfactory job, . Witz, which some of us may remember from The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> In other big roles, Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way, is a small drug dealer who can not get a decent job.Also, there is Dick Buckley as the drug king who hangs in a crane on top of a roof of "I've never seen" Gkenhaus "" Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop "so far, but I'm willing to bet on half a bill of $ 100 that Boccelli is doing. Also in this movie! <br /> <br /> Well, go back to the plot of this movie .. Go to Colombia and save today! But who cares about the orders In any case, the cast is fantastic, and the scenes are very good movement, you will never feel bored while watching this film! Highly recommended for all action lovers!
