"ZOMBIE" was a great Italian film by the great directors Lucy Folsi ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Matte ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio began this film and was sick until Bruno the Great took over. Amazingly better than I expected it to be, so if you've seen Bruno Matte's "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" and if you've seen "ZOMBIE" by Lucio Fulci and loved both or one of them, this is a movie you should see contains a makeup wizard "ZOMBIE "ZOMBIES" with a funny head "ZOMBIE" and "ZOMBIE" birds that spit on your acid and turn you into "ZOMBIE" (people are basically "ZOMBIES"), as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" . So, if you like "ZOMBIE" Italian movies or just "ZOMBIE" in general, rather than check it out superbly, the Italian zombie!
