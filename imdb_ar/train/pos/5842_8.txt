Can I be simple and primitive in my evaluations so that I simply say "I loved it"? It's reasonably funny through the bits, where you got great stars, and it's great to look at them. The songs (there are about two are repeated afterwards) are memorable, but they get a healthy irony treatment (like Mr. Fairbanks who is terrible and explodes in the furious Wagnerian version of the Miss Grable song that has just been released); there is not much dance with all the cholinolines of 1861 The square is about Miss Jebel, and the comedy may be a bit heavy, but the result is still very high. Photography (including impressive real outdoor footage) is spectacular, and plays in different colors of lush heavy gold. Miss Jable has lived a little longer and on the quiet side, but she is still new and comfortable in this "old" continental comedy. It's pretty much along the "Down to Earth" line with Rita Hayworth, and this person tends to not dislike him. So I assume that many people will consider this "lady in Ermin" old and embracing. But it is a fairy tale, and these tend to move in a certain paste anyway. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, costumes, prominently text and all that this film offers, and stop complaining. The film was shown on DVD in Germany, with German and English soundtracks.
