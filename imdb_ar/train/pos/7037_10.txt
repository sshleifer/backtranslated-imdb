This is a wonderful political satire. No wonder why it has been largely ignored in the United States: it reveals our deadly foreign policy of what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good film of this era, Rendition, was rejected precisely because it accurately demonstrated that the United States is a war machine designed to torture, kill and maim civilians in pursuit of full global domination. <br /> <br /> A clever plot, good behavior, and some great stars (John Kozak, Ben Kingsley, Marissa Tommy and anyone?) and some hilarious scenes should have made this movie a successful hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
