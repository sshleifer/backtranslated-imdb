I love this movie you know it will be full of camp and ridiculous like the original serial. I found it very sad to see Adam West, Bert Ward, Frank Gorshen, and Julie Newmar together again. Anyone who likes the Batman series of the 1960s should return to Batcave. You can tell the actors that they have a lot of fun in making this movie, especially Adam West. I bet he would jump happily back into Batman costume if he had the text to do. I told a number of friends about this film who chose not to see it ... now they wished they had it. I have both of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my group. Thank you for the reunion of Adam and Bert.
