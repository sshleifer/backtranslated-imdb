A lonely French boy Matteo (Jeremy Kaim) on a summer vacation, meets with Cedric (the wonderful Stefan Ridou) and is in a fine. Quiet and slow This film is very frustrating. On the one hand, I absorbed this and really felt the boys. On the other hand, I was disturbed - the film continues to flash from past to present without any rhyme or reason. It's very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> The spoilers are waiting !!! <br /> <br /> There are also tons of holes in the plot - Matthew, at some point, is doing something to end him in the hospital. What is - never told us! He then separates from Cedric and tells everyone that he lives with him. why? We do not say. Then he inexplicably connects with another man in the end. why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Matthew and Matthew lives in the same town so ... However, he is a tribute to the film he cares so much about characters. If only things are explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but he can not act. His idea of ​​acting sits with an empty look on his face - all the time. Redo, on the other hand, is gorgeous. He is very handsome and has a very beautiful body and is a representative hell. He also has incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is a full front male nudity, lots of kissing and a fairly candid sexual scene in the film which is gorgeous - most of the films are ashamed of showing love scenes to males. This film does not help and helps to see how the characters care and feel each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating but somewhat watchable film - especially for the bare sight of Rideau - that is, if you like young people with beautiful looks! <br /> <br />
