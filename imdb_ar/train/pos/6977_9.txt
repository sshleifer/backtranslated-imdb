I'm really addicted to Caprica, because it's a really good series to Battlestar Galactica. Its really a slow start, but it is sure to pick up shortly after the continued broadcast of new episodes. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This science fiction drama will surely satisfy those fans who love a mix of both types. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is doing a great job as well as Polly Walker like Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Well worth checking out! <br /> <br /> Enjoy Caprica on Friday from 9pm to 8pm SYFY
