After reading the other lukewarm comments and comments, I felt I had to come to this film. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films tend to be related to each other, and I expect this to be one of the likely ones I loved out of the mark. <br /> <br /> What this film is a thoughtful look and shy of religious faith. The only other film he likes - in terms of his religious message - should be the "rapture" of Tolkin's. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that anyone can say that the story is confused or abnormal. It is a simple film about Catholic faith, miracles and salvation - although you will never guess it until the end. It is also the only film I can think of, as his decision literally turns into a point. <br /> <br /> When I fell (luckily) a Catholic, I know what the film is about, and I find some kind of passion in his final innocence about the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the type of theology on which the film is based, it will spread over you. <br /> <br /> As a film - instead of the "cold sky" story - not a pioneer. While "rapture" is heavy with cinematic importance and cinematic imagery, "cold sky" reduces its cinematic properties. There are no eye-catching shots, no dramatic effects, and no attempts to link content to the template. Is a firing agent, but undefeated. He also has no dialogue or acting to put him in a high drama class. It is a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem strange. But in the end revealed the mystery. It seems mysterious. But with a single line, the mystery fades in the puff of the Catholic faith. <br /> <br /> In this respect, the "cold sky" essentially has the same thing as a film, such as "The Sting," "The Sixth Sense," "The Final Count," or Polanski's "Perfect Formality." These films with the trick up the sleeves may frustrate you along the way, but they have a clear point, in fact - but the fun, at least in part, is accepted. <br /> <br /> Still, even if it sounds more than just The story of a shaggy dog ​​with a punch line, it is worth watching for the way it directs you and tells you to try it out - especially if you are a Catholic or you were in the past.
