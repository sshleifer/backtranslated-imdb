I can not agree with the above comment - there are a lot of really interesting and amazing cinematic images in this video, which have an unusual structure and move well towards a frightening climatic sequence known to be effective for silence. What is more, the strange motive of suicide is explored in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what appears, but does not dwell on the over-excited subject. He has hints of a documentary on the subject as well as horror film and cinema, worthy of a place among the canon of "different" horror films such as the Blair Witch Project and the Original Ring (both of which are well-known and can not be recognized). Definitely worth watching if you are interested in the edges of the horror cinema.
