Cheech & Chong's Next (1980) was the second film to star in Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. Beloved smokers are burning now in their rooms. They live in a building condemned to look for ways to record more smoke and lie all day long. But Cheech is "in charge". Has a stable and friendly job. One day, Cheech wants to scare him, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem also arises, brother Cheech "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in town and wants to hang it. Confirming that it could kill two birds with one stone, painting Chish on Chung and red. What kind of adventure will Chung and Reid enter? Will Cheech get his whims? How long will Chung go without some smoke? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG's NEXT MOVIE to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes over the director's reign. Got some experience when he did some work that was not based on UP IN SmoKE. Funny but not as good as the first film. Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by nice dreams. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
