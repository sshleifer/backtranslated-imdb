This film is the second indulgence of Damien Zephron in the films after his excellent personal study at "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes", he invented very good characters, away from prototypes and with unprecedented cleverness between them. I saw Szifron's talent in presenting each character in an exhilarating but just enough way to engage us emotionally with them. The film captures a wonderful trend and a comprehensive text beautifully polished, and the characters laugh and cry with real feelings and invites the viewer to join them in their emotions and evolution on the screen. <br /> <br /> The Spanish take over the English language, the urban landscape in Buenos Aires is replaced by Hollywood collections, and the premise is as interesting as any other film, so we have a movie that dares to compete on Hollywood machines. But I want you to see the film mainly because I did not deal with such favorite characters, all of them. The script seems to fit the actors and vice versa. I really believe that a film like Argentina, is really due to competition.
