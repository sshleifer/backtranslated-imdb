This film is wonderful in all ways that do not have the adventures of modern movement. Take some time. Relax and enjoy. Think. People who see this movie are slow, full, or boring. They really need to spend a week's vacation and watch it a few times until their brief interest in being involved with a reason or even a beautiful story is in a beautiful place. You need it in the short time allotted to you. At first I was afraid that Brosnan played the role of an American citizen. Given the line of the story, I think it was fitting to pour. Now, back to my hermit. -Jahfre
