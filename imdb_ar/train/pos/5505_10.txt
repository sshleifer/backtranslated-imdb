This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup, and there are two Irish documentary filmmakers inside. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president uses his power to bring illiteracy to his people and encourage him to read the Constitution privately by public media as a dictator, a mentally retarded Hitler, a new Hitler, etc. without repercussions from the government (eg, For example, silencing them through bullets and other traditional dictatorships). Oh, and they still claim to be oppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> Look at how the media plays their part in the coup on television after they overthrew the government with the help of the generals' roster (how stupid can you get?). <br /> <br /> See how the people of Venezuela went to the palace, held the constitution in their hands, and re-installed their elected government. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a fictional story in Hollywood, but it actually happened, against the obvious wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, filmed from the center of the event, very sharp and embarrassing for the main supporters of the coup: the good, democratic, and freedom-loving United States of America (which still draws large amounts of money to Chavez's political opponents). <br /> <br /> Also very entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
