Although I generally do not like remaking the belief that remodeling is a waste of time. This film is an exception. I did not know yet so I read the previous comment that this was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written are no doubt: it's Cabot. No more words are needed. Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts are fantastic. I've seen some movies with them, all in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in the case of Eric I always wondered why his sister was the famous star number one and not her brother. This time this certainty is raised to the fact, no doubt. It is clear that his play, as well as Mr. Edwards' play, is the highest in all his career. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this movie be among the top 50 films you have to watch and keep DVD shelves.
