Yes, this is one of the great musicals with which she grew up with some great artists such as Frank Sinatra and Jane Kelly, not to mention Catherine Grason's small and small voice. Music and dance are wonderful. I understand Frank taking lessons from Kelly; there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is unique at the moment. Betty Garrett plays the role of the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's disdainful stars. I saw this again on A & E TV as well as in my old videos. Do not tire of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood ??
