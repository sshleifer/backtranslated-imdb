This is a well-made documentary about the exciting world of the Indycar race. Photography is simply wonderful. The scene was Mario Andretti driving a race car the old road on New England Street lined with the old maple, the leaves blowing on the side of the car quickly, is incredible. The film loses some of its beauty on the small screen but if you love watching the cars driven to the limit, you should see this movie.
