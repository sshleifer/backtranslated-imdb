finally! A decent British comedy is not centered around some of Bankney's bandits or bankrupts from the television series. John Evay's film is a story of psychological impact, wearing a biker. The three heroes are the sweet fools with a tendency to fail and all of them have a turning point in their lives, giving the sensitive and emotional trio of sub plots to sew comedy riots together. The chemistry between the three amygos is clear and leads to an impressive association with a hilarious dialogue and some classical comedy moments. She feels part of Withnail and I, part of the American Werewolf in London, and the part of Quadraphenia (but only because of cycling bands, Phil Daniels). In fact, the lovable Rogue Daniels Daniels reminds you Danny Agent in Withnail and I, with his scientific approach and his scientific commitment to drugs. It's a great movie, especially for those who have been involved in psychotropic substances in the past and who will be connected to many of the film's moments. She is a wonderful figure in the Welsh scene at the Welsh Corner, where she buys snacks while breathing on curtains. This nice comedy will warm your heart and laugh out loud. You do not have to ride bicycles or even love them to enjoy them. But will add to it if you do. brilliant.
