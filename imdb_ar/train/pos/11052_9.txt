When I was six years old, I got to know a series called Los Campeones, and even if I was just a kid, I did all I needed to convince my father to let me see The Champions and Avengers once a week. I think this was the Golden Age series of English ... (I already have the full cycle of "The Prisoner!") But also continued after a few years with "The Tomorrow People," "The Worst Witch" (I'm just me, or this Is the "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before what I want to be "Campions" in Region 1 or Region 4, I also waiting for "Dr. Who" (package the entire series in the package, uhm, maybe 300 DVD, I could not spend more on it, 8), "People Of Tomorrow" and several other "low budget", but great stories to be available within the areas I arrived in. I spoke and understood English, but not all my relatives do it, including and My parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope that one day one will feel the attraction of this series and then sell it as I see it originally .. dubbed or translated, but in the same format I saw it, remember that Zone 1 or 4 is OK with a device My TV!
