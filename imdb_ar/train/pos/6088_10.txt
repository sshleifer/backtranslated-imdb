Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they still succeed! I thought the actors did a great job using a nice script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walker. Most people on the blackboard seem to really hate this film. Personally I can not see how that could be, but Envy is one of the movies you love or hate. Much like Napoleon Dynamite and every film of Leslie Nielsen. Either you think it's one of the worst movies ever produced or it's one of the most extreme movies. Do not avoid this movie due to revisions. Watch it and see if you are one of those who really love it! If you do, I guarantee it is well worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, you know now.
