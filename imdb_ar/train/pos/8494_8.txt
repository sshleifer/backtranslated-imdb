I saw this film again as a duty for my management class. The various management methods and ideas related to quality (product) were mainly commented upon. I rented this again in the eighties and I remember it was a good movie (but not great). I've always loved Michael Keaton's style and delivery. It was quite appropriate for the film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some low ratings for this film. Yes, I do not get an Oscar, but it has a good comic value. It is more than a hidden comedy than a total comedy farce. I also find some who felt that this film was inaccurate about cultural and commercial differences. I beg to differ. I give you back that there are a lot of generalizations and drama but again this is a Hollywood movie not a documentary film. Through what I read about the differences between the automakers on both sides of the Pacific at the time, many basic ideas were accurate at the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the fundamental differences that Japanese workers felt were part of the company as a whole. Group work was emphasized. Perhaps they made the company above all else. Where American workers were more than a kind of relationship management. The individual was more important than the company. I may get some hateful emails about this comment. I'm sure about that. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how to display quality and its responsibility is to fix it. In many Japanese plants, defects or problems are checked and corrected at the time of discovery. Instead of saying one of the characters in the film "was the problem of dealers (meaning car dealer)." <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated, but I'm sure some still exist in the same number of American car makers still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American, European and Japanese automakers, I can recommend a book that examines this subject in more detail and in the same period of time. The book "The Machine that Changed the World" is called James, Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Ross. It is a study of automakers during and before the period covered by this film. The portions are a bit dry but I think you'll find they support the movie too.
