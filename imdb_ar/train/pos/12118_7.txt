When I saw that this movie was only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. It seems that the intensification of W Somerset Mugam's giant novel to a film that is less than an hour and a half seems like a disaster. But as you know, the film is not bad, and it has also managed to keep a lot of what makes the book resonate with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard that many movie enthusiasts complain that Leslie Howard was the wet noodle for an actor, and so was, but I can not think that anyone is more suited to play the role of Philip Carey instead of the wet noodle, Carey. Howard plays well, which means you want to shake him and slap him upside down over and over again, and then finally bring him down and buy him a column of poverty. <br /> <br /> Ah, then there's Bette, as a girl with whom Carrie cares and who brings his world around him. I did not know what Mildred's attraction was on earth in the film, and the film remained true to those details. But as Davis played, they became the most wonderful character in the story, and if they were bad and undesirable, they were at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any given time. Davis's performance here is attributed to changing the screen representation, as Brando did about 20 years later when he shouted "Stella!" In the play Tennesee Williams is not known, it is not difficult to find out why. Davis is so scary. Do not make any effort to gain any sympathy from the public, and allow themselves to look ugly and unfamiliar. Her appearance when Carrie intervenes late in the film to find her dead or almost dead due to an undiagnosed disease (though not very keen to hide the fact that he is sexually transmitted) is shocking. Of course, it's useful to get this movie out before the production law goes into effect; if it's been made a year later, you can bet things will be a bit different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left in the cutting room floor, and the story has become a reality about Carrie, Mildred and much more. I found it to be the least interesting and most boring part of Mugam's novel, but it's the part that the novel gives its title and seems to be the part that readers are still attracted to now, so it seems to me a wise decision about some of the filmmakers who chose to adapt the novel the way they did. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
