It was a very low budget (some scenes seem to have been recorded with a home video recorder). However it contains a good plot line, and easy to follow. Eight years after her mother was shot sexually abused, her father, Amanda, was released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor, who treated her secretly. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying a car for her. But during the first 20 minutes of the film, Amanda and his daughter were killed in the backyard. Then she sees that her neighbor Richard puts his eyes on his eyes and does not stop at anything until he has. She acts innocently, but after another neighbor found out that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to kill Richie's wife Laurie (this is after Amanda gets him in the hot tub). Then stop acting innocently and kill Buzz and then try to kill Richard, who is supposedly loved and cared for. You have to rent the movie to see if Amanda is dead or not. A good film Overall, it reminds me a lot of my life that you know that the fall of the whole neighbor does not stop at anything until you get a part of it.
