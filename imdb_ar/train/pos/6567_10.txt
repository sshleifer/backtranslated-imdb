Most people (36) gave this film 10 and those who did not criticize or might expect something else. This is one of my favorite films since the 1980s, growing up on you and containing everything. I just got them on a DVD and after 20 years still do not disappoint I have a lot of movement, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that wonderful car chases, automatic fire of weapons and lots of things that will explode and you'll get a fun, experience experience of your seat! So you'll be humming or whistling the main song for days after seeing this. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will enjoy it a lot. The premise is that a paperback hero, like Doc. Savage, already exist and help people fight evil so he can write the story, almost real in life here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and writer for several films. In this film, Jake Speed ​​is a adventurer of Indiana Jones, usually using his head to get out of difficult situations but occasionally resorting to the terrible firepower (yay!, And good luck too!). He watched his high-tech equipment, James Bond, the ultimate off-road four-wheel drive out of the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very beautiful young attention from the early Jim Carrey vampire. The film "Once Bitten" is here a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are "real bad guys" and they are the most deceptive trick in this life I love to hate. The ending is perfectly perfect and can stand on its own or call a sequel, unfortunately never happened - but you can imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie just because it will suit you and make you happy and this is worth the price of the ticket.
