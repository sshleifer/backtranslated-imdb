Robot Jox does not suffer from the story or the bad effects. I mean, it was 1990 if you knew what I was talking about. RoboCop 2 still uses stop fees as most movies did in the 1980s. If you look at your biggest movies during this period, most of them did their best by using special effects shots that were available to them at the time. It was not even Terminator 2: The Day of Resurrection was released the following year which achieved a breakthrough in technology, and the story's pupils began to use this motivation. But you'll have wonderful memories of Transformers, the Gundam Wing, and even Power Rangers, if you're watching this movie. Android enemy is very threatening. Makes you do not want to face a man without a really good backup plan. There are some wonderful moments in this film. Traitor / spy working in their arms. Who you think stands in your class and supports you along the way, can be the person you never expected. This is very annoying to think about, do not you agree?
