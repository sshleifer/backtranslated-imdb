The last PPE of the 2006 WWE proved its success with the fans, but for one reason only, a match of the ladder that was to be only Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But because PPV was a crap from December to Dismember, the WWE knew it had to do something to make fans talk again. That proved useful when MNM and The Hardy Boyz were in the mix and announced that the game would be a ladder match. <br /> <br /> The match was brutal and one of the best games of peace I have ever seen, but the face of Mercury was completely messy. Johnny Nitro did not check his partner, they continued as nothing happened, and Taylor and Rijal did nothing during the game except for some shots with a ladder. In the end, London and Kendrick retained titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the show, Ken defeated MVP in a respectable hell match when he set off in a stupid MVP costume. Chris Benoit dropped Shavo Guerrero in a decent match, defeating Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE weight championship title in a strong effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a complete mess, King Booker collaborated with Finlay to take on John Cena and Batista. The procedure was poor and no one cared about Batista who had chosen him for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Ken defeated MVP in a hell match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Bryan Kendrick kept the WWE Championship. Tag titles against Hardy Boys, MNM, David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Shavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the weight of the aircraft. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman defeated The Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Underaker defeated Mister Kennedy in a final ride. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista beat King Booker and Finlay in a very bad match. <br /> <br /> The general grade - B
