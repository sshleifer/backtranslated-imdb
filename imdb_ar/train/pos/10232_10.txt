After watching most of the films Ringo Lam, I can say that this is his best film yet, the most surprising. It is an ancient piece of the Chinese era filled with martial arts, where a hidden underground site filled with traps and fortified towers plays a big role like any characters. The work is wonderful, the story tense and entertaining, and the design of the group is not really forgotten. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not available on DVDs, and vhs are becoming almost impossible to get your gloves, even if you are near the second largest Chinese city in North America (as I do). If you can find it, do not pass it.
