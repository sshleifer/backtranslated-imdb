I got this movie from Netflix after a long waiting period, so I was expecting it very much upon arrival. My worst fear was that it was going to be full, and so ... well, you know what all the pretty girls were screaming at? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Like this? Awe at him. I was very surprised. The film was amazingly famous, even if photography and music felt like someone would hit a pair of bets every two times, and the acting was very good. Hyde, Kun, Um, Hyde, acted like a friend / friend in a gang that hardly surprised anyone who saw him on stage. It is one of the two main beef with the same film. But the rest of the cast (including the children's actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did - who were often shot and yelled at. But my second problem was very simple, and it was about safety. It seemed very frightening to me - like every scene where someone was shot, either he was sneaking, or really dead, or lying there for a fairly long time. But Sho just ... takes the snapshots, over and over again, breaks the bubbles, puts the bubbles while speaking, and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're a fan of any actor or just a fan of j, it's definitely worth watching.
