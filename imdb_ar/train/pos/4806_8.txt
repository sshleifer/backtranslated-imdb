A new aspect of the Victoria and Albert story is presented by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most of the bright ideas about Queen Victoria are the thoughts of a woman who has ruled for decades and lived her life in mourning.

The Victoria Plantas are both new and self-contained throughout the film. Her strongest sights are with Albert (Robert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Petani). All actors are donating well including Miranda Richardson in what could be an elusive role. <br /> <br /> Although this is not an exciting storyline and historical moments of "representation", the story is still interesting enough to make it worth watching. There are some historical freedoms taken by Screenwriting, and the film tries to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the time period. Group design and fashion are wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film will be highly appreciated by those drawn to history, dramas in time, from Blunt and other actors. Warmly recommend. <br /> <br /> Row: a
