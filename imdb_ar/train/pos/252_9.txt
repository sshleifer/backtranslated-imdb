The shows were fantastic, the costumes gave a unique feeling to this period and I was a living Victorian historian, and I was impressed with the accuracy of the arms and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I will not say you need to know any Kelly story to stay with this movie flow but to understand the events and attitudes of time you will need a little basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some silly people do, to have any of the characters of the Auzzie tone as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during childhood. <br /> <br /> Well, the story was some elements of the imagination but these are needed for the wider follow-up of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the added feature on the DVD that he wanted his film to be a "source of inspiration," which is exactly what happened to me so this film gets the thumb here. <br /> <br /> Watch it and you will not be sorry
