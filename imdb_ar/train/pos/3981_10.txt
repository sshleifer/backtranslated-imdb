This is the fourth Joe McDoakes that I have seen so far is one extremes. In this, Joe takes audio lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boer and Ronald Coleman. When he goes to Warner Brothers Studio (the company behind the series, by the way), Jack Carson asks for directions that confuse them. Actor George O'Hanlon (also MacDocks), who speaks with a more natural voice, is not too far from his later voice, Girgis Getson, and reaches the group where the director is automatically disturbed. I will stop at this point and say how funny it is that I found everything and I was fascinated by the movie stars that were presented near the end. The last scene was a special track on this note, go to YouTube if you want to watch it, so you want to be in Picutres!
