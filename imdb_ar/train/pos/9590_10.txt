The documentary begins in 1986 in New York City, where the black and Latin clouds of karate are held. This is where they wear what they like, and support their purposes before the public and vote on them. We recognize many members and see how they come together and support each other. As a man says to another - "You have three blows against you - you are black and gay and queen drag." These are the people who (unfortunately) are unacceptable in society - just on the balls. There can be anyone and whatever they want and be acceptable. Then the film moves to three years (1989) and you'll see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It seems frustrating but not so. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and come out with a lot of humor from their positions. They are well aware of their situation in society and accept it with a sense of humor - just as they should. We discover that they all live in "homes" run by different "mothers" and help each other. The sense of belonging to the community in this film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> When this movie was released in 1990, it was controversial - and it was a great success. She won the Best Documentary Award at many festivals - but she did not run for the Oscars. They were caused by "black queens of Hispanic origins that are not academic subjects." Fantastic is not it? Homophobia and racism together. <br /> <br /> It was seen today that it is still a great movie - and a piece of time. No longer is this - New York no longer appears. The balls are still held but not by the spirit we see here. Clouds have become more "acceptable" in society (for better or worse). I heard that the houses also disappeared. This kind of grief. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know that two people died because of AIDS but I have no idea about other characters. And what happened to such a 13-year-old and 15-year-old age listed? <br /> <br /> However, it is a wonderful documentary - wonderful and funny and nails. Must see all the way! Clear 10. Where is DVD ??
