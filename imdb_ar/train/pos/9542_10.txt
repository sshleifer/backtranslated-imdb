Do not be fooled by ridiculous titles, it's a beautiful trip! As a real successor to Tetsu the Iron Man and Eichi the Keller, this jewel starts with a bang and puts the weight on thick until the credit flows. It seems that foreigners control the bodies of people and modify them to become war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game to entertain their types. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. This is often about the plot, but who cares when it's good? I have no idea how many buckets the mud used, but disgusting to see. There is an interesting and effective use to stop movement when acquisitions are in progress, loving love is being taken care of all the creature's effects and make-up. CGI is a bit limited, but this actually does not detract from the overall quality of one bit, at least for me. This has already been a fun and enjoyable film and deserves a lot of praise, and has really earned its place in the Classics Cult stack. Find it and watch, you will not be disappointed!
