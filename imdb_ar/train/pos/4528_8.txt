Although the film is clearly dated, the masses can still easily recognize Buster's unfortunate plight in this very wrong and ridiculous story. The Buster fights against uncomfortable odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, the Roman era and the modern era, where they play almost the same character with the scene changing to help us define different "ages". In this film, we see one of the early comedies of the cave man, who wins his love not through romance but through brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman cameraman fighting. Two comic drawings precede such tricks as Mel Brooks' History of the World: part One". The basic theme of the film is simple but convincing: although times may change, we still face the same struggle even in modern times in which we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (consider this is the theme of 1923 America, A time when chauvinism was still popular). It is interesting to look at this film after more than eighty years, and think about how much things have changed dramatically from the "modern era" of this film to date.
