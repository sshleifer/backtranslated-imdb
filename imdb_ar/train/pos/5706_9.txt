If this movie were produced a few years later, I would have dropped the score a point or two because the sound quality was fairly bad. Sometimes, the movie appears as a silent movie during the internal scenes (natural ambient sounds are missing). However, since it was 1931 and a French film, this can be completely overlooked. Especially since this also happens in subsequent French films - at that time the vocal difficulties should have been completely resolved (as in L'Atalante of 1934). <br /> <br /> Well, apart from some minor sound problems, this is a cute little movie about a missing lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. During the search, there are many small songs that you can not help. A beautiful enchanting film all in all.
