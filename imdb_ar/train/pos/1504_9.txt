Four great stories from Mr. Robert Blauch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early 1970s, are the basis for the excellent production of Amicus. This kind of film was very common in the 1960s and until the mid-1970s, and it's one of my favorite horror movies. This in particular shines for the Sweets to the Sweet episode, where Christopher Lee was chased by a wicked little girl, heir to her mother's tradition. The other three episodes are very enjoyable from start to finish, and from good to very good (with the last little episode on the comic side, but with the wonderful addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire in English cinema.
