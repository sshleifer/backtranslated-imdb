I love this serial republic off! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Despite its strength, the image quality was not the best, but OK. Fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They just have to practice some more. As I said the story is wonderful! You just sit there and wait to see who is Don Del Oro! Music theme is excellent! It is the same man who fought music for the Walt Disney version of Zorro, who fought the Fightin Legion music and the buildings were very good. Zorro is really wonderful as well as hardcore! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love to play Red Hadley as Zoro! It's funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
