First of all, I would just like to say that this film has obliterated most of the modern waste that Hollywood cooked from its bowels. McBain is a real motion movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It contains all the classic elements of the motion picture in the late 1980s / early 1990s .... Unjustifiable random violence (for example, when Wakin and the crew travel to confront drug dealers for money, they appear and die rather than let them live and take their money only) ), Pick up necks, men who shoot, people who blow up buildings, and of course men who burn in buildings. He is at his best in this picture and he offers unforgettable lines like, "Let's sit .......... on the roof." The others who make this film share clearence shelves in the local video store. If you have shed blood for unnecessary random violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
