I had to give this film only 10 because it did what many of the films that were cast on black audiences failed. This film was free from video cliches, and it surpassed bands, rappers and obscene language. I have examined many relationships between doctors and African Americans and the romantic relationships between males and females of African descent on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the films and a subtle mix of light humor with some hard and heavy issues. The film will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I also saw him at the Boston Film Festival. It was first shown at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this film reaches a much larger audience. Black people (and anyone else) like a movie like that - if the industry is just smart enough to get them out there! <br /> <br /> As an add-on - if your doctor, resident, medical student, primary student, married to a doctor, has a brother doctor, a family doctor, or a great doctor - they also love this film. The accommodation and practice were portrayed in a realistic way highly appreciated by doctors, residents and medical students who watched the film. Dennis Cooper's stay in internal medicine is entirely - so he certainly applied his knowledge / experience on the film and this is very clear.
