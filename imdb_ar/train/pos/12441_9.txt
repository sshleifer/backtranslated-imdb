This was the modesty we did not know! It has been hinted and summarized in the comic strip for syndication by the unions to the newspapers! I and Janet Bachler were the real Modesty Blaise fans who got the Dream Job - tell a preview story about Modesty as never before. In their voice comments, they admitted that they had made changes in their origin to make the story smoother. The "fundamentalists" must also note that we do not really know whether all that Miquelus told him was true because it was "broken for a while." I did not rent or borrow the DVD like other reviewers did, I bought it! I do not want refund! I saw him three times and did not sleep through him! A wonderful dialogue and well-drawn characters cared for (even the bad guy Mikelos) just as in novels and comic strips! I also can not wait for the next movie Modesty (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" sign on what will come!
