I love to give Kolchak a top rating but soon moved the show from scary / intriguing to ridiculous. ABC error. They took the show to Friday nights at 8:00 pm and was known as the "family clock". Friday should not be in the first place. I was a high school student and loved the early episodes! He was the first woman against the police on the NBC. ABC faced big problems on Friday nights. The season is bad for them in general until Barney Miller, Barretta and Swat appeared in January of 75. Kolchak had to be a successful hit. Darren McGavin begged to get out of his contract to finish the show. Too bad the writing was not translated into Richard Matheson's original TV movies. However, McGavin made his Kolchak, as the actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Karaden and Carole O'Connor as Archie Bunker. It seems that INS with manual typewriters and clacking teletypes strange and strange today, yet it was part of the appeal. They were very lucky to have Simon Oakland remake the movie "Vincenzo" from television films.
