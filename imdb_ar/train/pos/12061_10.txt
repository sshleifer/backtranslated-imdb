From time to time in the wonderful world of terror, diamonds are manufactured, and one is completely struck by its extreme brilliance. This is not less than a diamond !! It's a movie full of comfort, horrific anticipation and a dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And of course it probably contains the most frightening single sequence in the entire horror history! Every time I watch the film, and as far as I know it will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will fear my intelligence, but it will never happen; I never understood it, and I find myself terrified like the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, to intimidate such a dilapidated fan of terror, this is no less pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their precise details and are proud of the art of acting. They do not need any special influence in order to convey the atmosphere. They rely on the strength of the story and the creeping (in this case) of motion and anticipation. Each single element is impeccable, from specific pieces, representation, story, to the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran certainly can make the devil ferment, that's for sure !! As a final note, if you do not like this crazy reason for some madness, then you honestly do not know what horror it is about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either. thank you!
