This show contains all comedies in comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's in the seventies. This is the only difference he has with other TV comedy. I do not know how you can love this show. Her beauty is pathetic! I mean, direct jokes ... A typical dialog box is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you." (Laughs audience) Jackie: Fez you're rotten. This is not funny. I think if she does not have those laughs (I do not know how to call her in English, sorry) you will not laugh at all. This is not a smart comedy, it's an insult to the audience. I like most American comedies, but that's not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)
