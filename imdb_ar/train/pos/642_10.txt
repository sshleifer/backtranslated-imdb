I have been going to this film about four years ago by my friend the French actress. <br /> <br /> I was sitting for the first half hour in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, I hate this movie, I hated myself and even hated the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened but I was pulled to the film in a way I have not been in years. This was despite the fact that one of the monitors had broken and that they had to do each change by hand. I was in the theater for about four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I think that great films attract you into the world, make you part of it, and then go down to talk to your friends about coffee or a drink. This film did it. It was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
