I was all ready to review this episode, where I saw that this "Master" really does not contain any horror movies under his belt .. but this is the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> Good !! I do not know how he quarreled with him, but we have some real talent in this episode! Although you could see things coming from a mile of wisdom, it was at least amusing and kept me involved for 56 minutes, something we lacked until this stage of the series. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed in the end, not at all at once, but I was a little funny as it became, as in the case of a critic's baton. <br /> <br /> A really good effort. As I said in other reviews, these are not real masters who do many of these episodes, but they may end up someday becoming masters in the future.
