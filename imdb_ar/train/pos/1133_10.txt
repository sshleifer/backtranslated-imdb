It is a movie so delightful that my wife and daughter found it irresistible. This plot is only crazy, but it "believes" the world of serials in all the shameful possibilities and possibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performance of Kevin Klein and Sally Field. I'm not the best of Klein in playing THICKheaded. She was a character who gave birth to a really desperate need for attention and emphasis - and her almost bipolar flips in a mood - played well against the famous film (Notorious?) "You love me!" Oscar exclaimed. People who can eat such large grains of salt are very rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only film where I did not find myself impatient with the description of Whoopi Goldberg; I thought it was a "spot" in every note I hit. Robert Downey Jr., Terry Hatter, Cathy Moriarty, and Elizabeth Shaw were also top notch. Just a wonderful movie if you are in a mood to go along with laughter!
