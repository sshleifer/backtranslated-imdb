Without being my favorite, this is a good thing because you're changing speed ... even if it's only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Everything starts with a great battle between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who are renamed "Butch" here). They all beat each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and impressive decision: he stops fighting and suggests that they are all friends. So, they all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which will not last for long. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the three became compassionate, patient and gentle with each other. They even save each other when someone is in danger of life. The relationship is not going well, so the steak appears very large and all become greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual battles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is a really fun and enjoyable experience, even if it is for a short time. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, as a strange fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are playing here in useful versions: "We're in a shutdown mode to see the wizard" and "Somewhere over the rainbow".
