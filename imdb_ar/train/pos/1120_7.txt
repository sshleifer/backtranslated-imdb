It should not be confused with the black British comedy of the same name that appeared in 1994. But this shallow tomb is a wonderful addition to the ten-slant of wood in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The plot goes = 4 girls from a women's club planning the Florida Spring Break for life, but plans are being made when one of them sees a man killing a local woman, and when he realizes he has been seen, well, let's assume He became a deadly cat and mouse game and things get worse when he becomes a local police chief. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Shallow Grave is one of the most deadly pieces of the 1980s, especially in the late 1980s, when the slope of the sloping slope was one of the few who did not. This film should be better known, regrettable. This one movie already confuses stereotypes (just try to guess who the last girl will be - I've made a total mistake). The main actors are all loved, one of those films that she hopes they all escape, and of course they do not. This, besides the tractor jug ​​in the first half hour of the film (in a good way) with some flashes of real narrowness (the second murder provides a real shake) and some unexpected wasting (although this is not a high thrill budget I did not expect a naked scene where A woman was strangled with her bra (accompanied by hysterical religious radio) in a film from the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> One or two bad things about this film, not just bad, like the sub-plot with teenage boys who do not go To nowhere and to the end that was stupid as well as the inability of a deputy to follow logic.There are no sharp tools in the The graphic, but in my opinion at least, it flicks in. The scenes that girls hunt through the forest by a vicious Sheriff are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, the evil is very interesting and interesting, with Fantastic offers from all four girls and those psychics.
