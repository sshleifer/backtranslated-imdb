Like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, another great comedy that is misunderstood, Envy has a great performance by actors who play mainly, losers (which may be a very harsh word, and I will call them retirees from the suburbs). <br /> <br /> This movie was a dark comedy jewel, and I'm not sure what people expect. I enjoy watching a major studio comedy that is not full of humor, and I think the small moments in this film make it worth it. A look at Stellar's face when he sees that Dog Du disappears for the first time captures a moment, the moment most people should know about themselves. Yes, the story was fairly simple, but it studied the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were lots of great scenes (the corrupt J-Man cabins on the banks of the lake), the non-brave Corky, the role of Weitz's wife, and J-Man Walken - all great things. <br /> <br /> I can not stand people who get IMDb and trash movies mercilessly when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one film, and I will almost face Envy as one of the top 10 comedies a year Except for Napoleon Dynamite.), An anomaly and fun. <br /> <br /> Remember these people; most of the time, people do not equate with good.
