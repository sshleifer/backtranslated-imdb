This film is a riot. I can not remember the last time I spent in these wonderful films. I have seen some good comedy in my time and are usually very funny. But this one is wall to wall large lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie I've ever laughed at and many movies. The film was non-stop until the end when they cleaned up a 5-minute emotional plot. Otherwise it is a constant barrage of lines and idiot positions. I want to see him again before he leaves the theater because this is similar to the Zucker movies where you do not get all the jokes the first time. You should see it two or three times to insert it all. <br /> <br /> As far as the actual film goes, it could have been used better, it's sometimes choppy but we should tolerate that. All characters are wonderful. It's not like Adam Sandler's film where he tries to be funny and everyone around him is a joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all very loved. There are no victims in this film. Thankfully, they also got a 45-year-old actress to play his girlfriend. Played by Katharine Kenner, a favorite in this film. I just wish that women like her really existed. She is not a "10" like some of the other leading ladies, but her smile is somehow warmer than Julia Roberts' excessive over-eating. <br /> <br /> If you see the video for this movie, you may not think much about it. Assure you, trailer do not do it justice. They do not give up all the good jokes. Just some of the average. <br /> <br /> Oh, something else. I hope that critics put this in the top ten list. Many complain that comedy films do not get the recognition they deserve, and then at the end of the year did not put them on their list. That means you are Ebert !!!
