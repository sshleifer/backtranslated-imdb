Pick up this on a DVD and watch it again. I love bright colors versus dark images. Not my big house fan, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pachino is amazing, as always, and well, this film was the period in which Madonna was more attractive to her. I wish I were stuck with a "breathless" look longer. The first really big role for Charlie Korsmo, other than "What about bob?". The effects of make-up were developed at the time and are still going on for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood takes you directly to the comic strip environment. Cars, wardrobe, buildings, even street lighting and a wonderful tone, not to mention the ideal lighting, although many red-colored scenes can get annoying, as they tend to a little mystery. I just wish my house had got a chance to come on. All in all, a few hours fun.
