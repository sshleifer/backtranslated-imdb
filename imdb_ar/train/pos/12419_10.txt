I love this movie like no other. Again I will try to explain its advantages to non-beginners, but for now let me quote a few pieces of wonderful dialogue, which, please remember, every tongue in the cheek. He will understand Aussies and Poms, will everyone be like that? <br /> <br /> (Song title) "He can sink a beer, he can choose a creature, in the latest Bondi double-breasted equipment." <br /> <br /> (Another lyrical song) "All pommies are bastards, villains, or worse, and England is a ** hole in the universe." <br /> <br /> (During a television interview on "The Artful Program": Mr. McKenzie, what have you liked most about artists since I was in England? (Barry replied) Flamenco artists! <br /> <br> (While chatting with a small naive little girl): Mr. McKenzie, I assume that you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Ree Barry) Abus? I have not seen Abu in my life.My mom is doing most hard yacca (no hard work) About our place. <br /> <br /> This is just a hilarious farce taste for this Australian Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it, watch it and enjoy it.
