I always enjoy watching movies that make you think, and do not just get answers to the audience. "The Pistol" is one such film, although many reviewers have mentioned it is difficult to follow, with little concentration and an open mind acquired. First time. True, it is not compared to other princes such as "usual suspects" or "souvenirs", but in itself a clever and thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how beautiful it is. In every scene, it seems that every corner of the camera has been thought of throughout the ages. If you see that, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, close it ... see it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it. If not, well, no one has ever said "gun" to everyone. That is my 2 cents.
