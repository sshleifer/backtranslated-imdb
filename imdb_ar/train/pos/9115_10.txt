The idea is a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting and entertaining and the renderer leaves wanting more. The product produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I saw. This movie has been rated as high as possible. I also recommend showing it to office managers and business people in any organization. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never heard and never heard. It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to move forward. I hope the product will produce a second part of this "idea". I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again congratulations to the media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
