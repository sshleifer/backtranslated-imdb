Many people commented that the film was not close to the first. Well, maybe not - you. However, how does your child interact with her? Well, she loved me more than the first. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, Disney movies in the past may be a bit harsh on young children. (For example - Bambi's mother falls). This film was really great for my small sensitive girls who love humor and happy ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to be agile about what Disney standards should be based on past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a good-hearted little boy you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your young children. This movie is wonderful as a movie before bedtime for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I am happy with a movie that satisfies my child and does not need to convince parents all the time.
