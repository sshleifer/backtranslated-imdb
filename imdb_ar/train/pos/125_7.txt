Lars von Trier is never lagging behind in the experience of new technologies. Some are very authentic while others forget. <br /> <br /> Postwar Germany is depicted as a nightmare train ride. Because many cities are in ruins, Liu Kessler, a young American of German descent, feels obliged to help restore them. It is not a simple task because it quickly finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle found a job as a night commander on the Zentropa railway line. Its function is to meet the needs of passengers. When the shoes are polished, the chalk mark is on the soles of the foot. The terrible argument arises when chalkboard shoes are not made despite the fact that they have been polished. There are many hints at German intolerance of such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The train journey is symbolic of the human procession through life with all its experiences and trials. In one sequence, Liu knows the backcars to find them filled with half-hungry bodies that seem to have just escaped from Auschwitz. These images, appalling as they are, float as they are in a dream, each having its own terrible effect that has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> At a station called Urmitz Leo jump off the train with an integral bomb. In the light of many pedestrians, the bomb is attached to the underside of the vehicle. Go back to his cabin and make a clock connection. Later he jumps off the train (at high speed) and lies in the cold grass on the bank of the river. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is construction rather than destruction. Later, when he sees the train approaching a giant bridge, he runs very fast on the train and stops the clock. If you are interested in analyzing the situation it is an absolutely impossible task. Quite ridiculous in fact. It can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange to remember small details like a row of cups hanging on hooks and hiding with a train swing. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film has gained widespread fame, I prefer the following films by Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). Place the bomb described above, really took me out. Maybe I'm realistic.
