Darius Goes West is a film that depicts the American belief that everything is possible if you try hard. This wonderful and fun-filled film sometimes appears as a youthful spectacle he never expected, but he was eager to see what was outside the boundaries of his beautiful city Athens, GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His old friends Logan and Ben and many good friends decided to make Darius' wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan started an email campaign to raise awareness of Darius: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and raise funds for students to take Darius not only to see the ocean but to see this great United States. To say that young college comrades have succeeded in bringing hope and awareness of this dreaded disease will be an understatement. They realized the dream of Darius then some. They put their lives on hold while giving love, care and loads of fun to Darius while they were helping Darius see how he could show those same qualities to others suffering from DMD. Darius went to volunteer in the Red Cross - sitting on his chair collecting money (with his companions) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support you and your care. Give Darius and all the Oscar players - no one deserves it anymore. Martha Sweeney.
