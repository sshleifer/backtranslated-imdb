I saw brother brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Jude Hersch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen's parole in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He appeared there because his brother died, and he embarked on a journey to slowly reform his separate relationship with his brother's wife, child and father, who was never forgiven for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand the complexity of their lives. The picture of the woodwork and the Brooklyn background sets the tone for this rich and wonderful family portrait.
