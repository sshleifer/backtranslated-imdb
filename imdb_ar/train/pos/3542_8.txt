If you were familiar with Guys and Dolls before watching the movie, I might not be as fond of him as I am. Despite all fairness, I may still like to make the film better because of my general admiration for Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is also a good actor, see the Manshurian candidate or from here to eternity). <br /> <br /> As for some of the other reviewers' comments about songs, they have Broadway music, and although Isabelle Bingley's voice beats Jean Simmons, it's no more fun. I find it very good quality. The voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although it is recognized that this is not always a major concern in musicals. Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's poor voice record was during his delivery of "Luck Be A Lady" and there just because I was used to Sinatra's release. I also find that Vivian Blaine's voice is more satisfying in the film than it is in Broadway. Sinatra's voice alone will be able to compensate for the failures of others, if they really need salvation. (Not so) is the best of Sam Levene's songs, especially in my favorite song "Sue Me". <br /> <br /> Also, the complaint of deleting a lot of songs from the movie in search of poor songs, I wonder. "Bushel and Peck" is hardly a jewel and the song that replaced it, "Pet Me Poppa" and its accompanying performance is more than Hot Box material. Personally, I do not care about "Marry the Man Today" at all and I'm so glad I did not include it in the film. I adore "I was not in love before" and although it was not in the movie, the version can be heard when Nathan In the dressing room in Adelaide. In Love'express the same feelings are equally well and perhaps in a range that both stars can reach more effectively, and the film will not be the same without the song "Adelaide", not included on Broadway. In fact, if the soundtrack for the movie is available for sale, I recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that the acting would be better than the actors movie show. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is as charming as it has always been and the representation and son does not make it any less.
