I can not remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly strange - like a rubber choke in a highway accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the truth is alien to fiction, and the truth here is something to be seen. I do not really understand how this fictional account will be released this year. How can you improve this? Jackie Kennedy's cousin and cousin are taking themselves out of the New York Society and hiding in Hampton. In this process they become isolated and what is best described as "mad cat women." They would have been hidden if the city had not moved to condemn the property because of the filth and rescue Jackie had followed. This film was made after this rescue. All the time, you could only think, "How bad was it before?" It's a look at the upscale society from the dark side, and it's absolutely fantastic.
