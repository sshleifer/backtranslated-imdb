A fascinating and fascinating look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easily linked to his work, especially previous films, The Silent Age. Very enjoyable despite its little length, I found this to be one of the best documentaries in the film yet. Wanted to watch if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
