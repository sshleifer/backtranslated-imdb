This is one of the very few films where there are very sexy movies without being pornographic, although there is a very rude plot. There is no direct voice or dialogue; instead, actors disclose voices to describe their experience, why they participate, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a document. > I can fully understand why no one else has tried to do something like this. There is already something like this. this is. :-) <br /> <br /> Note: The product does not have the right to distribute the DVD version. I also have not seen it anywhere; one can email Mr Boerner and request a copy on VHS.
