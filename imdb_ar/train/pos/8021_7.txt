Muppet III may be the most enjoyable and delightful, as the gang moves their modest music to bright (though volatile) Broadway lights filled with usually na√Øve optimism. Of course, their first attempt failed and Kermit (the group leader and the author of the show) beat his head; so the others all go in separate ways so that he does not feel responsible for them. Kermit himself endorses a young, undulating fashion designer who makes her ends by serving food in her father's restaurant (the old man, then, has a particularly unmarked line!). We get the usual delusional appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as an overbearing dog owner), Dabni Coleman (as a trustworthy), Elliott Gold (also in MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Haines, Lisa Minelli (as her personal image? Has her image in an elegant restaurant replaced by Karamet, a fake sporty drinker, as a businessman ostensibly celebrated in a ploy to attract publicity to the show of Muppets), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (probably the most Entertainment for the film As a producer of Broadway Kiss Kermit seems to be acting in the direction of the street and grazing as he wields a witty wig Fur!). The other Muppets go one way or another through their usual steps, with (sadly) less space being given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is an acquired taste with me, a scene in which the latter spies what she wants to be a love story in Kermit with the waitress ?? Especially its violent reaction to this ?? Funny without a doubt. What is frustrating, however, is the presentation of the climate itself (after the extra middle section where Kermit gets memory loss and eventually moves to Madison Avenue) and who, instead of the unexpected routine, gets nothing more authentic than a concert Wedding Kermit eternal torch Miss Pig!
