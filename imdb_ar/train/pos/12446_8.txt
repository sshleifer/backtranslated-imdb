After I heard about Modesty Blaise before, but did not read a novel or a comic tape, my wife and I loved the film a lot. I have presented, in an easy way, a good introduction to the character and its background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some flick elements of motion, it is an intimate, well written play. Unfortunately, this too, where a major flaw was detected in the film. An intimate play on the abilities of its representatives Unfortunately, only half of the actors were handed over. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job like Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nicolej Coaster-Waldo - like the villain Miklos - did not. Smiling his way across the plot as if it were an expanded advertisement for toothpaste, he failed to build an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The support team is somewhat similar, from some stereotypical gangs and fascists to worthy performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lope and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
