Michelle Rodríguez is a well-designed high school student who discovers she has a strong punch and begins to train an amateur at a gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, almost the biggest of them, and he trains there too. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago was instructed to save her in the next match bout. <br /> <br /> Both are involved in a "blind gender" sports program that does not discriminate between males and females, a misguided attempt to settle the stadium. . <br /> <br /> A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I do not - "Let's face it; the president is black." I am here to make an equally clear observation - "different men and women". Now, in 99 out of 100 cases, this does not have to make any difference in physical performance. But in the list of trained athletes who have one percent and whose skills have been honed well - men generally enjoy the advantage. With narrow hips that can work faster. They have a larger muscle mass and a higher trunk force. These differences in body building make it possible for a woman to give birth and raise children and men to catch and kill food. This sexual spasm is the result of a completely natural process of natural selection. Without it, there may not be any human beings at all. This is boys and girls, and that's why they have events for men and women's Olympic games. I am speaking to you as your anthropologist. This will be ten cents, preferably PayPal. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this blind gender-blind program. As a talented player like Rodriguez, as she approaches the climax of the game, she will eventually lose to a male. <br /> <br /> This is where complications arise in this movie. Rodriguez finally meets her boyfriend, the boy Douglas. Not wanting to lose any anger on the other, not to mention round table rights, but their pride at stake, pride has a personal relationship and gender. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. Rodriguez is dissatisfied with what he sees as his patron position. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from the film. I thought she would be a "million dollar girl" from Clint Eastwood until I discovered that this was released years ago. I did not hear about the director or any of the artists. This kind of ambiguity generally raises the crying of bad TV and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised at the accuracy of putting this together. The total absence of bassos left me open. Also do the minimum use of clichés in boxing - the eroded cords, blood, swollen eyeballs, post-nano-worn faces, fat scenes and sweat shouting "Kill him!" , The slow landing of the glove on the nose glove, the sweat spray of the deformed head, the heroic music that refers to the long-awaited triumph of the victor. None of this is here - well, almost nothing. The whole plot can be considered an equation. A tough child finds an outlet in the ring, and so on. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you've probably stayed is what these amateur contests look like. Different from the ones we see on television and regular movies. There are no bells, for example, instead, screaming a dancer's rule and committing "Stop!" And "Box!" Racers wear head equipment. The gym does not fill a crowd of cheerful spectators, but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the current events. It is a clean film, despite a rather gloomy environment and unpleasant family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty pretty, what about the bulk of the muscles and her eyes glow under her low brow, but once you get used to the idea that this is the girl who can knock you on the door any time you want, Female features of her supersegmentals, it's not bad. (The scene in which her father is fighting on the ground is overstated.) It was a little difficult to understand Douglas's seizure when Rodriguez crawls all over him. The director, Karen Kosama, has chosen her talent carefully. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination and a little money. There must be more movies like that. Take one of those multibillion-dollar movies filled with dinosaurs or spacecraft, and spread a little generosity.
