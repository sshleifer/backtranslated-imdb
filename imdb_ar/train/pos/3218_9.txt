Nine out of 10 people may seem to be a high mark to give them a direct science movie to a video that was tarnished at the box office and strongly criticized as the poorest film in Kurt Russell's life. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, when you read negative reviews of this film, it usually begins with the woody nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the named soldier. I will also start here, with my statement that this is probably the best part of the acting I have seen in Russell. Todd is emotional paralysis and suffers from severe post-traumatic stress disorder - this film he wrote before this phenomenon was widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> Shooting immediately. Todd is withdrawn, uncommon and only. He is suffering from illogical anxiety - linked to high temperatures through training, which teaches him to analyze each movement and interact with another person in search of signs of betrayal and danger. His excessive concentration brings with him the inability to understand the greater communication that his tasks have achieved - there is a scene in which he cuts himself and divides the islands and continues to work without cleaning or cleaning the wound or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical strength and focus on his job, but it is also a sign that he simply performs the task by heart - without understanding the relationship between the vegetables he prepares and the food that will be eaten later. <br /> <br /> At least a reluctant dialogue - both of the two big scenes in the film are key to the film's plot, both of which underscore the dark nature of its existence. Fear and discipline were told to us. Always. The fear of keeping him on high alert will not go through the smallest detail, making him ready to respond to the edge of the knife. Discipline to hold it in check through his fear, to overcome it and tactical performance. The conclusion is that he does not have time to think and can not bear feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his response to Sandra Nielsen's embrace - but I think you have to interpret it from the point of view of man, which is the only experience of embracing in combat - the tremor represents him in suppressing his instincts / instincts. For fear of being caught, his movement and vision are constrained - fear and discipline really. <br /> <br /> Then there's the subtext to let go (actually twice) - representing the way our society tends to throw pedestrians on the trash pile in society when they have served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are former soldiers in our world, since it can be worse. Russell soon takes on the burden of diamond responsibility toward his wife and son - in dire need of a mission, even with a high probability of death. <br /> <br /> Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between the church of Busey and the hotshot of HQ, Mekum. The new Mecom men are faster, stronger, more precise and aggressive. Anyone can push Todd to the ground - but it's not about what tools you have and how to use them. Todd uses the free catalyst to exercise his initiative and act without the stunning effect of imagined superiority, ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to break through a smear through the latest module - sent without support, coverage or survey. It is a reminder that military power can not compensate for leadership failure. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle topics. When a film is filmed and written very sparingly, it leaves plenty of space for your own interpretations. Watch the soldier with an open mind and see what he teaches you.
