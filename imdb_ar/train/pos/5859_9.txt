This wonderful game of Marvel superhero pays tribute in an appropriate way by maintaining its loyalty to the cartoon. Among all the Superhero Marvel games that were very lame due to weak graphics and play, Spiderman improves in both sections. It also features Stan Lee, a Spiderman cartoonist. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, Spiderman will do whatever the spider can. It does more than rotational networks. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When the web is not used in combat, it punches and knocks as well. Spidey has his own hands fighting Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Search for Captain America in a penalty kick. <br /> <br /> Most levels are difficult, but some need patience to overcome them. The only complaint about this game is that it is too short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Marvel superhero lover, this game is for you but you do not expect to play for a long time. Good luck in "Spider-Man 2." My rating: 9 out of 10.
