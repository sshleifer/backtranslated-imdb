The turning point in "The Matador" is almost half of the film when Danny, a man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel and enjoys a quiet moment. Someone knocks his door, and knows that Julian, the murderer paid, refuses to answer. But do you really? <br /> <br /> Richard Sheppard, director of the film "The Matador", is the character of Julianne Noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. In fact, we have already seen in action, doing what he does better. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real Bar in Mexico City, he pours beans and tells his new knowledge of what he actually does for a living. <br /> <br /> Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, but appears to be competing against a local group that appears to be in the lead for the contract. Danny is a na√Øve person who falls prey to the charisma and magic that Julian takes the most intelligent. Not long after that, on a cold winter night, the murderer appears at the door of Danny asking his friend to return the favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. At this point, the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, who is acting against writing, has made a huge contribution to the unprecedented Nobel Prize. Just to watch it as it walks across the lobby of the hotel in Speedo and boots gives the right impression of its character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this strange pair. Amal Davis appears in only two scenes, leaving us sadly why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall appears as a link between Julian and his duties. <br /> <br /> Richard Sheppard guides the way he works with his own material. The musical result is written by Rolf Kent, and the cinematic portrayal of David Tattersall clearly reinforces everything.
