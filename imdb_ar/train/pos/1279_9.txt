This film is an amusing and utterly cynical view of popular culture and its producers. I was impressed with photography, which is made up of bright colors and circular settings, especially when you think this is Zukic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> One warning, do not take the movie message seriously. It's not for mass consumption (this is not a compliment). The message is a fairly simplistic view of post-college, a neo-societal view. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot line of Zain's imaginary editor for a biopsy in the 1990s.
