Just Cause takes some of the best parts in three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil, and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes it together to talk to a good movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to former assistant attorney-general Kate Cabsho and a crusader against the death penalty. Grandma Blair Underwood, Robbie De, is intent on Conrey at a conference and persuading him to deal with the attraction of her grandson. He is on death row for killing a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural county in Florida, a tough police officer playing by ruthless Lawrence Fishburne in solving his crime like Orson Welles is in a touch of evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery gets the verdict aside with evidence to discover, he feels good about himself. At this point, the film takes a definite turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that everything is not what he seems to have put it mildly. The runway is cast uniformly in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris, who plays the role of Hannibal's lecturer, like the armed murderer sentenced to death with Underwood. It will make your skin creep and begin to rethink Connery in some of those comfortable liberal headquarters on which he built his convictions. Many of the confirmed liberals I knew came out thinking in a completely different way once they became victims of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course the reverse is true too. A lot of law and order if the conservatives are involved in the wrong end of the criminal justice system really want to be sure that all their rights are really guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but it is practical and never ending in that for the entire society. I think Just Cause has a moral likely to be.
