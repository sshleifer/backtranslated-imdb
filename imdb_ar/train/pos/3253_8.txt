It is not a film that should be taken seriously, but a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. Representation, IMO, excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that you will not go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time you broadcast it on the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - -
