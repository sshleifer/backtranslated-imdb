Long before Tim Heije and Jerry B. Jenkins had cleared the world of Christian subculture (and made millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND books, Mark IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham Evangelical Society, presented a masterpiece. What I like most about this genre is its amazing attention to detail, and it is sitting in the living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of "after the rapture", we sit in the living room and hear about it in the news because filmmakers can not show it. The film is based on the pre-millennium hypothesis, the science of pre-ordeal, believing that Christ comes once to take the true mystery of the Church, and then comes again at the end of seven years of hell on earth. What terrified me in the highlands now makes me laugh. Patty's intriguing adventures and her journey through the ordeal (and two of the three trilogy of the film) tell her wonderful story of disbelief and ultimately damnation. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy watching this. So that it has the exact same result of Monte Python and the Holy Grail. I think I am the only person in history who made this observation.
