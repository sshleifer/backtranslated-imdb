First of all, it is a masterful work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises. The little boy pretended to grow up and inherit a million dollars and how he spent. I mean how this was eliminated. Walt Disney really outdone themselves this time. Comedy is most often anticipated but at other unexpected times. I mean this movie was OK or this movie was OK. He also knows a lot about the wise young man and I am this really wise child and a little clever breeches. But also sucks. How could a man like this kid get a hot babe babe and his mother allowed him freedom. This is like releasing the murderer on bail for ten years. If I do, I will be beaten with a "loud jack" (a huge stick that bites when I used to measure your butts severely). This child is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made the film, but it's still not perfect. The representation was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, and the father was not, but Bruce was excellent. The special effects on the other hand were lame. In addition, this film does not depend on reality. I hated and loved him at the same time.
