This flick is in tie with my favorite flick other "court disorder". This is a bustle of laughter for any fan of Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> The boys are guardians in the recording studio when they hear beautiful Christine McIntyre singing a wonderful version of "Spring Voices". She will be on a record deal, but she fears being honest with her father about choosing a career and proving she is a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the scouts decide to enjoy a little and play her record and wear Corley as Christine. A decade-old lady who can make Christine a career, sees Kirlie and miss him at Christine and invites Kirlie to sing for her party. Of course, there is a man who bothers them at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get back to them. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful stoge flick, this is not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
