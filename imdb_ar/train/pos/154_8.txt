He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. Surprisingly, Manuel Tor, one of his friends in his childhood, is also being treated and the girl, who was not welcome to participate in her games, became one of the nuns who oversaw their health care. It is clear that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means that he is in love with the tough bully. Their relationship will have dire consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamagor does a good job of photographing the older Ramalo. Bruno Bergzonzo gives the impression that Tor, the young weak. Antonia Torrens plays the role of Sur Francisca in condemnation. Angela Molina, puts the appearance of Carmen, wife of the acting institution. Simon Andreu is perfect like Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villarona in bringing the novel to life.
