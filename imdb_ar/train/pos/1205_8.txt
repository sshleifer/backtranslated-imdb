This film is exactly what his title describes - an attempt to get you to buy what the book offers. <br /> <br /> First, it's kind of good to see the 1996 Toronto model and remember it with all its pictures. Shaving silly hair, sunglasses, clothes, attitude. It really has not changed any. Just a small, safe and cheap urban ruin makes it a wonderful meeting place for international film types! It is also interesting to see Kenny and Spinney heading to Los Angeles and finding out that it is new in Toronto, only with an exotic variety of beaches, musicians, lucky owners, and other types of movies. <br /> <br /> I do not see the stadium as a movie to enjoy; it is not entertaining unless the viewer enjoys seeing someone's expectations. Take Pitch as a warning that energy and money are really kept by EXEC Studio and production houses. The writers, musicians and potential actors (and "successful") are still just passing people, even if they reach Big Time. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spinney are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
