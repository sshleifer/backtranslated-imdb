I love Christine Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think it's a kind of actress that would have preferred not to act before the camera, but just be yourself. I did it and it looked natural in Elizabethtown. However, in this film I tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, to become more like a solid editor. While in the other half, she completely reverted to her daily routine, and I could not tell her that she was an editor. Therefore, its performance is not always in this film. <br /> <br /> The film, in general, attracts and inspires. Young's personality is full and reasonable. In any case, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big drawback is that he did not show a turning point for the hero and the heroine's love story. I feel completely confused when they accept at the end of the story, because this is somewhat unclear to both people.
