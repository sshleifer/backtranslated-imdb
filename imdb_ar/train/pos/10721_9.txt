This is one of the most thrilling fun movies ever! <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I still enjoy watching her make her "like a very wonderful" space dress with a "bitchin" belt and a stick of rhinestones on her face. But in any case, the film is actually one of the few "family" films of your interest, I know the beginnings continue, especially if you know what will happen, but the second half may be one of the most exciting segments of the movie Family. <br /> <br /> I will not stand in front of millions of people and declare that they love this film, and in fact renting it is very embarrassing, but I will admit it here With the Internet to hide behind him. <br /> <br />
