A brilliant Russian immigrant devises a "Stanislavsky" system to win a contractual bridge - making him and his beautiful wife America's grand lovers GRAND SLAM. <br /> <br /> What could have been just another silly soap opera is high with good production values ​​and excellent representation of the small comedy situation is very enjoyable. Some unexpected touches are thrown to keep the viewer's attention - the way the basic principle is presented as faces on a set of papers; inserting zany into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of madness; and the way in which a wide range of different types of Americans are reprimanded By listening to the final broadcast of the game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas and Loretta Young are doing well with the nice and sophisticated Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas and Miss Young is affectionately and passionately beautiful (even if the script makes her swell on a cigarette too much). They are fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most convincing or persuasive. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh offers another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. Glenda Farrell, a cheerful figure, avoids her usual witty character in a small role like a machete ballet. Rosco Carnes is dealing with modern fast dialogue as a noisy radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is a great expert on the bridge. <br /> <br /> The movie Muffin will recognize that Dewey Robinson is the patron of a nightclub warrior; Emma Dunn as a sister-in-law sighs. Paul Burkassy as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lynn as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Connellin Kepitzer in the final bridge game - all unreliable. <br /> <br /> The movie benefits from the heresy of the bridge that has swept the country since its development in the 1920s. You expect the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the complexities of the game and not make any attempt to explain anything to the unknown.
