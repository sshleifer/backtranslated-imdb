Like almost everyone else commented on this movie, I can not help but wonder why this has never appeared on the video. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him at about the age of 12 years in The Late Show, around 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and strangely committed horses. (I do not remember the most horrible bits I've seen described here; it's probably broken in front of the TV audience.) But the scenes I really liked were about Lord Kitchener's death aboard the HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The sight of the devastated cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm was chilling, as I remember. <br /> <br /> You do not remember the musical result, but the comments of others are now strange. Get this one on video!
