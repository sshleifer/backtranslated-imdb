One of the coolest pieces of TV drama in the last decade. Over the course of the five hours, their perceptions and empathy are continually challenged as they explore many aspects of contemporary British society. David Morisi, as usual, is wonderful. At first she faced a heavy copper that ran counter to the heroine, but then proved to be intelligent and caring, because he worked with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I think it comes from the soap world of television. Her performance was impressive, maintaining a sense of humor and satisfaction as she tried to strike a balance between the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I can talk and talk about every member of the team who contribute to this wonderful drama, but their efforts will mean nothing without such an adaptive text that constantly defies your assumptions about any of the characters. Such programs restore the individual's faith in television drama while at the same time making it almost impossible to settle most of the waste that fills the airwaves increasingly.
