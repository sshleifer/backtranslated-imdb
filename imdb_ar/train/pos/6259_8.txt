I am really angry at the comment I read, saying this film was "boring" and that the beautiful scene was marred by black and white footage. Made in 1925! I think it is absolutely incredible because it is time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people had to travel was very impressive. It took them only one week to cross the river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden rails on their backs to climb a hard rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like to see anyone doing it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie with some really stunning footage and an amazing story.
