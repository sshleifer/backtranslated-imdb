Frank Capra 's Wonders of LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of HEMO THE Magnificent hard. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science collaborated with famous Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS science films to educate the public about the universe around them. Away from the bleak black and white feeds that are often imposed on young scientists, Kabra's films will teach and entertain both with vibrant scripts and stunning visual images that appear in Technicolor. The four films - we have Mr.. SUN (1956), a strange case of cosmic rays (1957), HEMO The MAGNIFICENT (1957), GODDESS UNCHAINED (1958) - quickly became the favorite school, where it was presented endlessly in the form of 16 mm. The serial star is Dr. Baxter (1896-1982), an English professor at the University of Southern California. This pedagogic teacher proved that he was the ideal coach of the film, collectively conveying to his audience complex facts sometimes in a way that did not make them look dull or boring. Dr. Baxter, winner of the Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to produce high-quality educational films after the conclusion of the Cabra Quartet. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, which was produced, written and directed by Kabra. The story of a human heart and circulatory system, using animation and humor is gentle. Starring Richard Carlsson as a fiction writer, he actively assists Dr. Baxter in the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> The movie Maven will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV crew, and the voices of Marvin Miller and Mile Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, are all unreliable. <br /> <br /> The book of worship that begins the film is perfectly consistent with the meaning and tone of production.
