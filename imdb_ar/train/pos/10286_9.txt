This movie is amazing! Although funny and entertaining, they are also deep and open to the eye. I will see it again and again. Bruce is a man unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it is not what he thought it would take to achieve happiness. Bruce is bitter and dissatisfied and resentful that his life is not the way he imagines. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he wants. His life is in the end what he had just imagined to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of getting everything, it is the only person I really love. When the film unfolds, Bruce realizes that the real change that should have happened in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspiring and profound. If you are really interested, it forces you to look at your life with a very modest respect for the fact that we suffer much more time than we know. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make him happy?" And my modest addition, "We may not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out."
