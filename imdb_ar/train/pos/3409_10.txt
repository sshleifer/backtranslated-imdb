North Africa in the 1930s. To a small Arab town on the edge of the desert comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning for her life and a handsome Trappist monk escapes the crisis of his faith. They will meet and emotions will be stirred, but even the Sand Diviner does not know whether they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in God's Garden. <br /> <br /> The plot is hokum pure, but the movie is still a great fun and nice to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boer are a wonderful couple on the screen. It is, simply, wonderful, and Boer performs more effectively and minimally, making his sensitive face do a lot of his actions for him. The cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role with Conte who loves the desert; Joseph Childcroft as a friendly speaker (all the "Arabic" he and others in the film are talking about are pure) Lucille Watson as a gentle mother; John Marshall as a mysterious sand diviner; and the brilliant Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> The movie Maven will recognize Helen Jerome Eddie as a monk; Marcia May Jones and Bonita Granville (overlooking the nun's shoulder) as a girl of the monastery; Nigel de Broglie as a lecturer; and Ferdinand Gochalk, a hotel writer, Accredited. <br /> <br /> Color films in the 1930s are rare and beautiful to look at, and this film is no exception - the film is as colorful as the desert itself. God's Garden was the first technical film to be filmed on the site. Yuma, Arizona, gave filmmakers all the sand dunes they might want, but polluted drinking water and a temperature of 135 degrees quickly led to the company's revolution. When the daily rush showed that the face of Pu'er had burned a bright red tomato, the product surrendered to David or. Selznick finally. The rest of the film was filmed on a Hollywood soundtrack.
