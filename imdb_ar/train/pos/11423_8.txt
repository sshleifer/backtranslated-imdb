This film depicts life in northern Cameroon from the point of view of a young French girl, Fran√ßois Dallens, whose father is responsible for the colonial government, and his family is one of the few white families surrounding him. It gives a sense of what life has been to both colonists and indigenous people who have been associated with them. It is compatible with another film I saw about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the film - but the plot is worth less. Leaves the viewer to draw his own conclusions rather than forcing the filmmakers to impose it, although framing the story as memories of a woman's visit to southwestern Cameroon as an adult offers some perspective.
