Is this a typical women in love love storyline love chains? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works now, a beautiful woman is presented in a picture, someone must fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows some of the story lines, but that does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes like Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, although they are short. Some things were not logical, such as the need to engage in random battles, but it is acceptable to see them, battles have already been done well. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a comedy above all, but it has a lot of good feeling for it. Humor is well balanced, your stomach will not hurt, but you will still smile. <br /> <br /> There's a little steamy activity, so not one for kids.
