If you go to this movie expect something not so, you'll be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemingway called "the effect of the iceberg." On the surface, the cache of random film clips was broken together to make a film. If this will be written in a book, it will be a short story, because the action in the film is going very fast and unless you actually try to pick it up, the logic behind the plot (along with some subtle alerts) can be very well passed by you. Definitely a movie you should see twice to appreciate it completely. Experimental cinematic photography barely describes this film. Camera and post-production work adds to the overall flavor of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and opening to others' interpretation (something needed in American films recently). Although it may be in some parts slippery, terrible and very heavy for some audiences, the film will never become completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that I would like to write off as "needs improvement" is the choice of soundtracks. There is no good film at all without proper soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is very long, and it was possible to replace other rap songs in the film with something more appropriate (heavy, heavy or narcotic rocks) Electron this film is a real trip). The flow of images and dynamic color schemes adds to that another "artistic" aspect, as well as the events that take place during the film, and this is not a film you can not miss any part of and still understand. However, it makes the film much more desirable, not a film that quickly gets bored of it. 8.5 / 10
