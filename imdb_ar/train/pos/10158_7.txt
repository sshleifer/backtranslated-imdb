Johnny and John Carter Cash financed the film, which is a traditional presentation of Bible stories. The music is great, and you feel a real sense of the world of Jesus (I've been there too). June comes to the part of Mary Magdalene with passion. Cash is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was wrong. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some music his faith. 3. Since it is unconvincing, I doubt that we will see this again widely distributed. <br /> <br /> I would love to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Pine Texas, USA
