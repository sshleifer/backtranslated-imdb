I saw this in the theater in the early 1970s. The most striking and frightening scene is when the German army attacks the yellow mustard for the first time. Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with protective protective clothing. The experienced British soldiers do not wear gas masks (only) and are waiting again to withdraw gas and German attackers. Approaching gas withdrawal ever, eventually defeating British defenders. The Germans move forward very slowly in their scary clothes. Suddenly the screams of the defenders ... This gas is incomparable at all that they suffered before .... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I remembered this scene since the last 30 years and I still tremble, I think you will too!
