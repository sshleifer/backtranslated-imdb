Rhea, Sutherland, Demon, and Phon Sido (in a small role) are all wonderful in their performance. Sutherland is particularly adept at this type of role, where he must portray the character of her ethics, initially, uncertain to the audience. As is often the case with Sutherland characters, you must ask "Is it wicked [in this case, minor], or hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, cleverly, about the incompetence and frightening bureaucracy of the old Soviet Union that hampered the efforts of highly qualified people. As Sutherland notes with derision, "the measure of bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions." The "meeting of the committee" (between the characters of Ria and Sutherland) after the perestroika is imposed, and when revealed, has a great emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who worked in this system. <br /> <br /> A handful of dramatic scenes depicting families of victims add an emotional resonance to the story's impact. This is rarely one of the films that deals with this disgusting subject, but it actually reminds us that the victims had lived, and were loved. On Canada TV History.
