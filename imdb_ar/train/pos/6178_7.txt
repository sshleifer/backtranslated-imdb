Mitchell's fifth feature is Lizen as a director, and he shows brilliance by directing a musical, after his previous films were a heavy drama. It also plays the role of etching as a conductor. <br /> <br /> You can say it's a pre-created movie, and nothing like it was done in the United States for a long time afterward (like over 30 years). Leisen filmed the music numbers so that they were like what the audience saw - no shots or over Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have said, the strings of the show are somewhat impersonal, while Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play ordinary film characters. But Gertrude Michael offers little spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and some are good (rape Rhapsody in particular amusing) but the drama is unconvincing and counterfeit - three murders have too much minimal emotional impact on characters. This is where this movie could have been much better.
