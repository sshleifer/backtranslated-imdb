Cliffhanger is what seems to be the latest film by Stallone Slyvester before he becomes a weak actor. It is a mountain climber who should help his friend after being taken hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three bags carrying more than $ 100 million in money. It has a wonderful movement sequence, fun edge of your seat and wonderful time in the movies.
