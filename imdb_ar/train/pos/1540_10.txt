This is an incredible film. I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish film. It is funny, it is tragic, it is convincing, and most of all is a slice of the life of the small Swedish town. Crushes the clich√©s, and dwells deeper. It makes you feel communicative, not only with the main characters, but with all the characters. <br /> <br /> A big girl in the city is chasing her roots, her small hometown, to celebrate her 70th birthday, intersecting paths with people she has not met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The focus of the story is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life), not very close. Or at least do not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why communicating with people in this movie is very easy. First, I am more than delighted by the fact that there are absolutely no Swedish actors called "List" in this film. There are usually a few actors that have the ability to find their way to almost every major production in Sweden. This time the production company managed to keep it real by attracting representatives who seem to love their profession already. Sophia Helen is probably the first Swedish actress since EVA Ross has shown that you do not need words to express feelings. <br /> <br /> Writing is also attractive. Dialogue is more than believable, and compared to other Swedish films from the past year or two, it is miles ahead. Maria Bloom is in charge of everything from the beginning, and if you do not know it, you will never guess that this is the first time she has written and directed a long film. I can not wait until the next step. <br /> <br /> Once you start watching this, you really want to see it.
