When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, the human drama that Gabrielle introduced was taken by no one and those who cared about them and loved them. However, we have now obtained a movie version of an excellent story and are expected to see the last in Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> The writer Armistead Mobin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With proper restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel's fragile essence and allows us to see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we get to know the players in this drama, we are reminded that there is nothing at all as it seems and that the smallest event can irrevocably transform our lives. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into an event that changes life and helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to move forward and move on. <br /> <br /> It's bad that most people avoid this movie. I'm just saying that because the average American might think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That has not worked before!" Please give this movie a chance! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all have to find and go in to become better people. Such as his film "One Hour Photo," stepped up as an actor and made a high-quality piece of art. <br /> <br /> Oh and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale while Jess steals every scene in it. The leading man in 1940 looks and has a screen presence. This is the miraculous view that he can carry his own film now !! <br /> <br /> S ~
