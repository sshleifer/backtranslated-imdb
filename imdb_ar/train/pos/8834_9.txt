A very good film shot in the early 1960s in communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are at the center of the story offer strong, sincere and profound emotional performances. A clear portrayal of how to easily manipulate the natural trust and naivety inherent in a teenager and how it affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
