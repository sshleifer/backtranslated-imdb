This film caught me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "flick". Boy, you were wrong! This movie has a great family appeal, without sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is an excellent performer in Homer Hickam's shoes. The support team is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> Science, family quarrels, family problems and a wonderful train scene ... this film contains everything. The soundtrack is good, although the result is presented very sporadically. The music of the fifties shoots the film over the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> Certainly the DVD deserves its weight in charcoal. The restart value is great - I've seen it several times already.
