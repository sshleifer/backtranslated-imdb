I decided not to believe what the famous film critics say. Although this film did not get the best comments, only this film made daily. He made me think. What a false world this is. <br /> <br /> What to do when your most loved ones fool you. It is said that no matter how many times the milk is fed on the snake, it can never be sincere and will bite when given a chance. In the same way some people so much that they never feel grateful. This film revolves around how selfish people can be and how each individual ultimately thinks of himself and works for himself. <br /> <br /> A brother accidentally dies at the hands of a gangster. The rest brother decides revenge. Through this process, we recognize the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has performed his life. The new actor Ariane performed well. The actress who played the role of Amitabh's wife was stolen. Her role was small but she portrayed her role so hard that one of them was influenced by her performance. Chawla had really wonderful facial expressions but her role was very limited and she was given an opportunity to express herself perfectly. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film written by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give some messages to the public. His films are similar to novels by Nanak Singh (a novel whose novels have always been a target and a social evil) because they have a real message to the audience. They are entertaining as well as giving lessons.
