I saw this on the cable back in the early 90's and loved it. I have not seen him again until he appeared on the cable again recently. You still find it a great Vietnam movie. I'm not sure why not a higher rating. I found everything about this film convincing. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can talk about the cases raised by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film has become more sensitive now that we are in Iraq. I hope this cable is presented on a very often seen by people. The casualties on our soldiers are not left on the battlefield. She brought her home for the rest there lives. This movie is one of many movies that bring this home in a very difficult way. Excellent movie
