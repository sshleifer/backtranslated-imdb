This, "The Prodigal Son" and "Oriental Condor" are my favorite movies Sammo Hung. Fat Dragon is more fat on this trip than in Condors, but he is no less confident as a director or actor. It is, in fact, in its highest form, and presents a destructive and brutal representative who boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and can tell a sweet romantic love story as well. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they work as curiosity supplements for work, ensuring that viewers do not press the fast-forward button between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, featuring Saber's jousting, makes a hard but deceptive tone. The sequence of a pedicab car from Sammo is displayed beautifully and sweetly comic. The fast and angry stick battle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of exquisite choreography and a sharp and brilliant direction, one of the best games ever. The violence of the film escalates slowly until, finally, when the climatic confrontation comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal barbarity we see in Samo's production. The filmmaker's assault on Billy Chau and a house full of angry opponents is a great joy for physical punishment. <br /> <br /> Fantastic on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Also great.
