<br /> <br /> I watched The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I listened to my dad to get me back three times. I started looking for it in a video about five years ago and finally discovered a copy of an online auction site, but I want to see it either by a new reseller and reissued (I understand the original video was small), or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel Disney and others. It is a wonderful film that guides you to the story of the struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan, narrated by a wise old tree. Excellent soundtrack complements the film well. Will be a good seller today, better than many of the vulnerable performances of children's movies today.
