I'm not sure if this is a kind of masterpiece or just a fluffy fluff with high performance and photos. Whatever it is, I'm sure I liked it. From the fascinating, intricate and tangled stories, to the delicious evil performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the stunning color that has been captured all of them, it is a very high level trash basket and very enjoyable. Not to mention veiled and ridiculous sexual texts that permeate the entire film, and always threaten to escape from the image to dialogue without ever doing so. I will lie if I say that the immense entertainment value of the film did not contribute to my love for it, but there is some sort of strange art behind the unintended comedy (or was it?) And I have already dug it. I really can get into this melodrama stuff.
