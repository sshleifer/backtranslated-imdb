I thought this was a very charming film. The story seems to be a biography of John Waters, who is veiled in a subtle way: Biker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong performed well in the lead, but the best performances were by his grandmother, Mink Stoll (Farhan's Veil), and among all the people was Patty Hearst. I think reviewers are far from base in this. They seem to be taking Baker's worst assessment of his work as a gospel, when I think the film clearly shows that he is a truly promising artist.
