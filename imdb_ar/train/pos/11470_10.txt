Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. What I think this film did not do is the elephant they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. During the film, we love them and laugh with them even though we know exactly what they will do. This gives me chills. Because I felt guilty because I enjoyed their comments, and I think Cal was a nice young man. Although I know what will happen you know it? Even at the end of the film when they were about to commit suicide and decide whether they had done it by 3 or 4, I thought this was funny, but I still feel terrified to see their heads explode. Of course you are. Got like them. Maybe they were evil, but I felt they were really normal people, and they did not really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This is IMO, the main force of this movie. Makes us realize that our friends, our relatives, or anyone else can plan for something crazy, and we will not notice it. This film, as it was good, made me feel bad. That's why I can not go to sleep now. There is still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
