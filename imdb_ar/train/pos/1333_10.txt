I love this movie a lot I've seen over and over again. I do not see why anyone thought that this movie was not good. Maybe you've seen better or whatever I personally love it. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Indian at all, but I love it. It may be like a "beautiful woman" but I have not seen it and do not think it is better than this. I do not know why you're floundering, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I've said enough, but I love this movie perfectly, and those who say it's not good at all, then I wonder why I've seen it and what movies it considers good. As for anyone else I saw with him, they also enjoyed it, so it surprised me that so many people did not like it. For Rani Mukherjee (I think this spells her last name) she is very pretty and my favorite actor at all!
