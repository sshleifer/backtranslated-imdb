"COSBY", in my opinion, is hit CBS must watch it! I'm not sure if I have not seen each episode before, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite. Also, I really liked the theme song. If you ask me, although I loved everyone, it would have been nice if Madeline Khan had not died during the show. Since that happened, I was always wondering what it would look like. Everyone was always doing well, the production design was amazing, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend taking it if it stops working well
