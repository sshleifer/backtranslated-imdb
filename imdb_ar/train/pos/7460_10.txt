I think a lot of people wrote this movie as another one of the exotic Tom Cruise movies (Magnolia, Is Why and Shoot), but Vanilla Sky is definitely her own film. Many people said it was strange. Not so. It was different and confusing but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Paulie Shore. Different Truman is introduced. A confusing matrix or game. Unlike Cobrik, this film has a finale. Everything is logical - maybe not immediately, maybe even today, but it would be logical. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Eames (Tom Cruise) is confused. This is the whole point. Here came the so-called "strangeness" that drove the critics away. If they were bothered by "opening their eyes" as an original Spanish film in 1997, they would have seen it. If that's not a reason to see it, go to it to see music. Cameron Crow presents great soundtrack. He uses it to set "feeling" - this famous element lacking many movies. With songs such as "The Bather Boys", "The Good Vibrations" that play at the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates a strange, but amazingly "stunning" sensation. Vanilla Sky is a wonderful film, with its own line, music, actor and picture, sad, a stunt film that critics ridiculed to make it look smart. Excellent: A +
