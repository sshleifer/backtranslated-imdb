The story is very unique. It revolves around these two pilots who save the earth from alien beings, but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them get older quickly. The entire series revolves around pilots who deal with lost time, friends and mentors. . <br /> <br /> The end may be great. I finally started with a complete observation and left a real mark but instead ended up with Disney's supernatural observation and annoyed me deeply. <br /> Animation is suitable for 89 but can not be compared at present. I have also heard many people complain of nudity. I actually found it fairly decent. Nudity was guaranteed for the most part except in episode 2 where there was excess. <br /> <br /> In general, well worth a look but the end prevents it from being a classic.
