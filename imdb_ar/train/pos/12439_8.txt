While the main story is supposed to take place in Morocco, this film was filmed in foggy Romania in 18 days with a very limited budget. Although their cards may be broken, the actors and the team play with them with remarkable skill and commitment, so I finally found the result impressive and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers a great performance as a bad man. The script and direction provide some gems. Whether you like it or not, your film Alexandra Staden may be a starring role. Other reviewers referred to Staden's shortcomings, such as Modesty Belize. They may have a point, but I found their interpretation delicious and very appropriate. Humility can overcome terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same here.
