We saw this at one of the local cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, Texas. It was a complete surprise compared to writing in the theater newsletter, but we were blown away by art. It was done beautifully and (apparently) filmed in Schloss (German name for Chateau) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very frank exploration of the sexual relations of a group of twenty-two men and women who are excluded from daily restrictions. It's wonderful on more levels than I remember. We returned home after the film and talked and talked until 4 am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there must have been at least two copies since the first reviewer saw the film in (possibly the original) German. I searched and searched for a video but found nothing. Definitely love to have your VHS or DVD version of this. It explores relationships at a basic level and is also a great tutorial on how to link with your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince them to release again, preferably on a DVD these days. I can not even imagine being tired of watching the outspoken performance of actors who may be in their forties. Please, please return it.
