I do not pretend, no matter how hard I look for myself, I will not find a better version of the film "Othello". If you love the great masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh, "Much Ado about Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), as much as I do I will also find "Othello" for Oliver Parker irresistible. Laurence Fishburne had various wonderful roles during his career. It was very impressive in "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I've always considered Furious Styles' most interesting part to be his greatest achievement. This was, of course, before I saw this. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello, and may be the most challenging in his entire career but he does a wonderful job. Ir√®ne Jacob is very charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just a wonderful role in the most magnificent role of villain fraudster, Iago Punk. The magnificent Othello is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's creative work. He deals with his favorite themes: ambiguity, envy, deception, and jealousy. This is one of the best films I've ever seen based on William Shakespeare's plays.
