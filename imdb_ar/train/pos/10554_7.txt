Nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange introduction to the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two main people who find themselves and move their home into a mysterious white space. There is nothing literally outside their small two-story house. It is interesting to be sure, but I thought that the comedy tune that was established for this film from the beginning was very bad. There must be some humor, certainly ... I have no problem with the humor that was ultimately derived from the plight of our heroes (their "final confrontation" was certainly a shout) ... but I really believe that the film would have been better off if it had remained More actually entrenched in the beginning. After watching the movie, I saw the make-up feature on a DVD and a short trailer in the end almost completely free of the "shiny" comedies ... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) film. Another half hour of the film is where things start to assemble together ... similar to the last "primer" movie. The actors are fine when they do not overdo the comedy shake. They really do believe in their "normal" moments. Maybe you're ready to write off this movie as a failed midway experience ... but he finally won me. (Continue to follow the credits for the last scene ... just do not ask me to explain it).
