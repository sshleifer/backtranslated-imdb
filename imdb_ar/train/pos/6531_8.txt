I really loved this movie ... it was nice. I enjoyed it, but if you do not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played Nancy Drew a good role, although it is not quite like books. Old fashion clothes are strange when you see them in modern times, but they look good on them. For me, the rich girls did not have clothes that made them rich. I mean, they seem to have got all the clothes - blindfolded - in a garage shop and just decided to put them together. All the clothes were vulgar, especially when they wore penniless trousers with their usual clothes. I do not want to make the film look bad, because it certainly was not! Go to the theater and see it !!! You will enjoy it!
