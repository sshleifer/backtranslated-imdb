Absolutely wonderful. Powerful and exciting. The most impressive documentary series on war. His tone contrasts sharply with the prevailing attitude towards World War II presented by the media. Instead of choosing to scream about the horrors of war, he allows the soft voice of Mr. Lawrence Olivier to back away from the real images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrible citizens and soldiers, shattered men, apathetic politicians, and mistakes that cost thousands of lives the suffering of innocent people. Most important of all is that a human is truly capable of achieving when all the rules of "natural courteousness" are removed. There is something Hobzi clearly about the human in a real natural state, will return to the more brutal form able to commit crimes is still shocking and fascinated 60 years. Perhaps there could be a follow-up series entitled "Century in War" of the twentieth century was really a century of horror. I feel it is a huge irony that took an event that caused the death of 50 million people to produce a wonderful and excellent series like this.
