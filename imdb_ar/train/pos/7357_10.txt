Well, where do I start? ... This movie is my life! The plot was smooth. James Cahill made his own. At first after the first viewing, I was disappointed that I had not seen it on the silver screen. However this was before exploring many DVD features! My God Jake Cahill, the film's commentary was almost as flawless as his acting. He told the industry secrets used in the film that you only have experience. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with other actors. The scene in which the security guard spoke with the girl in the hall reminded me of some of my favorite pornographic films. I'm definitely with Gangsta when he expresses disappointment without any supplement. <br /> <br /> I'm still blown away with every display of martial arts skills involved, just offset by a sign indicating the location of the library at school ... and maybe the guy playing the delay! All in all the timeless classic and the best movie comes out of Europe years ago! Where the Oscars at dawn! !!!!!!!!!!!
