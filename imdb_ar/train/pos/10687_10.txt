I must admit that I was completely shocked by this film. On the one hand, I went to see him on a whim expecting something modest, but given that, the most shocking thing was that this was in a popular American cinema at all. This is a British comedy at its best - dark, strange and funny in ways that American films never existed. However, I must stop recommending this wholeheartedly. I went to see her with many people, some of them English, some Europeans and Americans, and while some of us (mainly from the first two groups) loved it, some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you are in this kind of thing, go. If not, do not. 10/10.
