This film is a very funny and sad story about an orphanage that has financial problems. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to intervene temporarily to run things. <br /> <br /> This is the best work done by Leslie Nelson. His idea in the film to hire children is innovative immediately, and his selling techniques will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and attractive that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This wonderful family entertainment is very rare these days. If you go to the pictures filled with a few happy ending, look for this picture! I can watch this again and again, and often I do! My only complaint about this film is that it is very difficult to find a copy.
