I first saw this movie on the cable about 5 years ago and could not stop laughing. It seems that everything related to this movie clicks, narration, characters, and setup. For the film, I will not call this movie great, but it's supposed to be great. It's getting meaning across. The cast may be as good as any team put together in a comedy. Corbin Perpson, Fred Goen, Robin Blades and Ed O'Neill Farhan. For those who have not seen it, I will give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from a friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friend is caught by two policemen who chased him out of New Jersey, they try to figure out what is going on, and all hell breaks down. The film is really a wonderful comedy bank banker, which is somewhat like a poor man version of Eleven Oceans, with only four criminals unable to stand with each other, and in Montana instead of Las Vegas. All in all If I love laughter, I strongly encourage you to watch this movie.
