This film was almost a wonderful film. A mix of Shakespeare's tales, pop, jazz and anecdotes. This film was a fantastic development on Cinderella. This film features a strong film, headed entirely by Kathleen Turner, and has achieved everything. Everything except production values. I never think the film needs special effects or big budgets, but with such a higher production, it started with the same vulgar quality as all the other films made in television films. Along with the best cinematic photography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
