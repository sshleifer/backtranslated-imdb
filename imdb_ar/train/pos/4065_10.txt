I saw the original English version on the video. Disney's selection of vocal representatives seems very promising. I can not believe I say that. The story revolves around a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is synonymous with his history. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and interesting stories in any animated film. Excellent animation quality! If you see the Disney function in a Kiki delivery service, you can see the quality in their production. He almost retrieves them to steal the story of white lion Kempa. (But not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki movies are released correctly! I can not wait to see an English version of Nausicaa!
