When a movie is produced or released by Mel Ferrer, you can bet on any picture that will appear to generations after generation. Just the presence of Claudette Colbert (Elaine R. Ewing), "The Whites and I", 47 appearances and starring in the film will make him more of a classic film than the film, in which Ellen Ewing married and then faced all kinds of mental problems and even murder. Robert Ryan (David McLean), the 65-year-old "battle of bulge," comes to help Ellen and sometimes asks if David is moving in. When you see this almost-found picture, you begin to understand who is the most real and most sudden person, A wonderful work for Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan who played a completely different role from his role in To portray on the screen. I forgot to mention that the tendency Ferrer, married to a gorgeous movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Wonderful classic film, with wonderful classics representatives!
