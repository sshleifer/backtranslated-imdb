Now this is what I call a good scare. With hidden / supernatural tones, this beautiful, low-budget French film attracted my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need FX skin or much effort to shoot an effective horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot is about four colleagues in prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually becomes more interesting because the film builds tension to the end. Most of the actions we see through the eyes of Carrere, who just entered prison and have to get used to living with these three other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this film really deserves to be widely seen. However, there are some disadvantages: The Forex market is not good, but it is used effectively; the plot leaves some open puzzles. Things get very confusing in the end, but Malvic has redesigned himself by the time it was over. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
