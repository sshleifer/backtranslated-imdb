This Casper the Friendly Ghost is short from my childhood, and it was replayed on YouTube (thank God on my tube); then, I like this shortcut, which is one of my favorite shorts from Casper. <br /> <br /> I like how this short bet starts with Frank Gallup's novel. So we get to Casper sitting next to his grave in the cemetery, reading. While each ghost has risen from the tombs to the people of "Bo", Casper decides to leave in search of a friend. But trying to form a friend, anyone escapes Kasper. The poor Casper sat on a record and cried. Until the cub of the little fox comes down to him. Casper quickly connects the little fox and he nicknamed Ferdie Cub quickly and considers him his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie are in great danger, but Casper is not closely watching Ferdie while playing Hide and Seek. While an individual hides a fisherman and comes two of his own hunting dogs and trying to kill a little odd, he runs individually as fast as he can until he runs out and starts panting. As the fisherman launches shots towards an individual Casper notices that they are trying to kill him and fly in the direction of the hunter and begs to leave the fisherman alone alone. The hunter and the dogs are afraid of Kasper. Casper screams to my freind that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Kasper sees the body of an individual not moving and asks if he is okay. When Casper sees an individual dying, he begins to mourn the pain because he has lost "the only friend he has ever lived". Casper returns to the cemetery where he has buried an individual and made a grave beside Kasper's tomb. Casper continues to mourn the pain until he sees that Ferdie has revived the ghost himself. An individual starts licking Casper on the cheek. Casper screams for joy because he is reunited with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a really good short; though surprisingly worrying, showing death in family-oriented animation.
