It's a little disturbing to have a character called Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this movie is where Gig got his name and also a brilliant professional promotion after playing small parts under another name. <br /> <br /> I will oppose the majority of other comments and I recall that I really enjoyed this film, mainly due to the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, weak, and careless. As the eldest of three daughters, her mother died in Lucitania. Her father later died during the War of the First War. <br /> <br /> As a "man" at home, Fiona has been steadfast for years against settling her father's will and that would allow the Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get a family home. But Fiona kept a secret because of her dislike for Barkley so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle sister, married to an English man, but yearns for her younger sister's friend (Jeig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Stanwyck, this is not an opportunity.
