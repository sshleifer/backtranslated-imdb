Excellent cast makes this movie work. All characters were developed very well, and the actors obviously enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> It's not the comedy I was expecting, but a more enlightened look at trying to restore youthful glory than loud humor. . For music lovers, there are a few subtle signs that are in themselves cleverly funny. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw comparisons directly with other films, but much of this film reminded me of Alan Parker films helped her: imagine if the commitments actually make her big - and then try to restore that glory after 25 years.
