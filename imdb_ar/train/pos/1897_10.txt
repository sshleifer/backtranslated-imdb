Again, it seems entirely illogical, to me at least, that Arthur deserves just 6.4 out of 10. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece is an "unlikely" if not "impossible" mix of very different elements. Being able to make alcoholism laugh more than being tragic is in itself wonderful. Dudley Moore has bestowed his best roles, and every other film element seems to me to have the best effect, including the result, a patent and a terrible one. I challenge anyone to sit during this movie and not to laugh out loud. But, apparently, nearly a third of its audience managed to do so. Well, I found someone who found Gordon's effort laughable and affectionate, like Gerald Fitzgerald's great aunt and murderous Stephen Elliott's assassins who will become the absolute father jewel of the background characters. Even the black driver managed to escape from care, and the late Sir John Gilgud was late in accepting his pay, but was wrong to do his part. "Arthur" does not make any effort to "Underztand," far less rationalization, the scourge of "alcohol addiction" (hey, iFit is not bright, it's other favorite medicines, including meth, just addictive symptoms and not targets) .
