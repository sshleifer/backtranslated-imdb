Tour deficit! Well, the kid who plays Oliver is a little sweet! Starting with great cinematic photography, color, costumes and the most impressive shows, the movie must be seen. I have seen many modifications to this great novel, but this novel stands above them all, a musical play! She is a clever Fagan, never leaving his character to perform a song. You do not really know whether you love it or not, the same feeling you felt in the book. In other versions, you hate it from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... When you read the book hes mean one, and so it is in this film. Oliver Reid was brilliant. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and watched his last film, Gladiator based on his wonderful performance, not to see the headlines. Music fits the times and mood. Who will buy this beautiful film? Must be!
