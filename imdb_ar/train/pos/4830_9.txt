Although some reviews are visibly warm to Luke, I found the story to be quite full and even if some critics describe the love story as "Mills and Bon," what about it? It is good to see a warm and touching story of true love in these satirical times. Many of the audience were inhale and blindfolded their eyes. You really think that the young Victoria and Albert are very fond of each other, though, for political reasons, it was a arranged marriage. I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, might have played the role of villain. As rumored that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (the result of an affair with her mother the Duchess of Kent), it was interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is just as convinced as the young princess, besieged in the choked castle with police and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly visualizes the personal strength and determination that made Victoria the ultimate Queen of England, which flourished as never before, in her long reign. I think the oral recommendations will ensure a great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful film.
