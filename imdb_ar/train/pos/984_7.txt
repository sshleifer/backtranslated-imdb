I happened across the "house" on the cable one night as I started thinking, "Er, why not?" I'm glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> "The taste" is not perfect. He suffers from an unnecessary glamor and accidental numbness. But overall, this movie works. All the elements were quite right-aligned and pulled what could have been a very ugly film. <br /> <br /> I think most of that is due to Jimmy Fox. I do not know who tagged Foxx in the foreground, but who knew that movie was great. Foxx is admirably admirable and admirable during the film, where it is brighter and more fun than hell. You can say that it works on the instinct, and that the instinct does not let it down. <br /> <br /> In fact, the plot, though not important, is well connected to each other, and there is even a personal arc in which Foxx develops as a person. Again, they could have gone back without anything, but it made things much better. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the low rating of this. I may have discovered this step on the appropriate night, or vice versa, but I give it 7/10. Bravo, Egypt. Fox.
