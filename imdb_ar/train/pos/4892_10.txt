This was a smart and delightful film and I would not tire of watching it many times. It was a wonderful casting in matching young people with older characters. Some of us here really appreciate the good actors and the smart story form. As for Judy Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any kind of production in which she plays a leading role. I have always referred to seeing Judy Dench in all her shows. She is a wonderful actress and I am happy to see her as every shift in her personality comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see this wonderful picture of most recent animation lacking good characters, good texts and good acting. The film's audience needs heroes, not perverted cutters, who lack creativity and talent. How wonderful it is to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukes and Cleo Lin. I would like to see this movie win the prizes it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer and all who have done this wonderful job.
