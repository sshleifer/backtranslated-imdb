My personal feeling is that you can not separate this film from its political / historical foundations like many reviewers (Americans) who tend to do. It is not about growing on the main street in the United States. It is about growth in Yugoslavia at a time when it is torn between East and West. Just like men torn between Esther and everyone, tearing Esther between "Ju Tofarch" and men. There is a shame in some situations that are lost to an audience that never lived under Tito. I feel that the film is less than rating and that it is a bad thing we lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It is not just another "Eastern European film of an era," but a sensitive picture of teenagers walking in a fine line that could eventually lead them to true freedom.
