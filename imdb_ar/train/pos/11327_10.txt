The film is likely to have a budget of $ 750 and is still able to bypass Titanic. I rented this day when my mom's car crashed, and the only thing that encouraged me more than belief! You must be associated with "The Assult of the Killer Bimbos". Things to look for are: 1. Driving in the famous Chinese girl scene. 2. Blonde bleach in the Sasson shirt that never changes. 3. Screaming like a Pleiston outside the command 4. The clash squad worn by red hair before you get it killed (do not worry, I do not spoil any surprises, because it is very predictable) 5. The man who finds it necessary to heave. 6. Mental patient who plays a convincing function of madness by crushing maniquen eyes. 7. Long hours chase in the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. The woman writes graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least, the wonderful special effects - especially the sting in the boob that made ... sky helps me ... popping noise. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> </ strong>
