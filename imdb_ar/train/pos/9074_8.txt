The presentation is really funny. Nice topic. Jokes and linings are really good one. With a little extra tuning, it can become a very famous show. But the only major downside to this offer is the cast. David Spade is doing great work like Russell, and Megyn Price is doing a good job. But who shot the hell out of Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson, and Bianca Kajlic. <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are key characters in the show, making viewers want to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of loving family man, a relationship with ... an experience of all the problems faced by married couple in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - doing a terrible job as Jeff, he is not at all suitable for this role. It is like a robot, and there is literally no delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The actors are really important to the viewers. Bad behavior certainly will take the show downhill ...
