A great movie for Powell and Pressburger, and I want to explore more. The film revolves around what we consider real and what is real, and how the distinction between the two can be very difficult. He was filmed and photographed beautifully, although David Niven does not appear to be 27 years old, as his character claims. Fun to see young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think, while I was watching, and then.
