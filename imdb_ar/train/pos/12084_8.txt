Julie Ross returns to a traditional 65-minute bowl that does not seem too short. Julia Ross returns to the English tradition of things that do not look the same - for example, the Lady Vanishes. Unemployed Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds the job of dreams at a new employment agency in London, whose seemingly evil actor looks very anxious to make sure she has relatives living or her boyfriend. After reporting to the service, she awoke (after being anesthetized) in a Mandrally-like pile on the Corniche coast, supposedly the wife of George McCreme, who lives in the pit, showing an alarming interest in knives and ice. . The irresistible mama is the irresistible "Dame May Whitty" (this time a model of loud prowess on the other side of Good versus Evil than in The Lady Vanishes). Seeing a nightmare of this tale unfolds phobia. We know what is going on but we are unable to tell poor Julia. This film, oddly enough, regularly awards a place of honor as one of the earliest British films (and very few British films). I think it is closer to the old traditions of the Gothic Dark House than the wet American tradition and the urban corruption; yet, it demonstrates modern, more modern analytic thinking. Whatever you call it, it is still very exciting.
