My hour came too late but I'm glad I watched both of this and the sequel together ... which makes me commend the makers of this flick to give such a pure and fundamental treatment to the idea of ​​romance ... and a very marginal separation of the idea of ​​relationships! Since much has already been written about the film, it would be only appropriate to highlight a few parts of the film that I personally liked. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Sileen make fake phone calls with their friends is a very subtle way to tell each other what they meant to each other through a journey that does not extend for up to 24 hours ... The other has had an impotent effect on the other dealing intelligently with ... <br /> <br /> On the front of the plot, it is not easy to accomplish a romantic story in a pure conversation. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic clicks of this flavor, characters are not clearly designed even in the mind of the writer and director. What the actors highlight is what becomes of them .. right or wrong, so that the owners of the idea will find it difficult to justify ... to become personal, the life that the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... Here all of the actors do just the right job! Glory .. !!! Before sunset another feather makes this more beautiful!
