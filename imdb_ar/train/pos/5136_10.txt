Probably the greatest film about jazz at all. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot is still haunting. <br /> <br /> Leicester, of course, is a wonderful and wonderful thing of this world. <br /> <br /> Joe Jones always (see jazz sound too). <br /> <br /> If you can, search for music; it's available on a CD. <br /> <br /> All jazz and film lovers must study this wonderful jewel. <br /> <br /> What are the shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
