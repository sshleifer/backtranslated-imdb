This film is a movie that appeared well in 1932 and probably will not work well today because its style is old fashioned and crowded. However, if you are a gentle person, like me, who adores old Hollywood movies, the movie has cut a bit of a recession and you can enjoy it as it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in a stand for a problem load. In this large room, there are about half a dozen women waiting for delivery - but doctors are concerned about possible complications (such as yikes - such a room will really hurt mothers!). Like "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island," each mother has her own story. With so many extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend disbelief. I was able to enjoy the film a bit. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: one involving a father. You do not see the mother, but he is a very nervous father and he is included for the comic. However, it was wonderful here - very impressive. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are sad. Loretta is sent to hospital from prison - and she seems to have killed some terrible men. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume he was trying to impose himself on it! However, she has been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment - and her husband is loyal to her and is beside her as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has maternal instincts of hamster - really bad and very bad hamster! It's beautiful and fun and worth watching most of the movies. I loved her drinking from a bottle of hot water filled with jennes in addition to the annoyance when she learns that she can not make money selling her twin !! Late in the film, she had a typical change in Hollywood he was supposed to touch - she found it lacking. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a stillborn child. Surprisingly, after words, they put the lady in the same wing as the women waiting to give birth! A crazy woman, I assumed she lost a child some time ago, wandering around the psychiatric unit. She insists on having a child. Later, run away again and actually take one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are most stories of this but the stories I mentioned are the main stories. As I said, it's an opera series of some kind and very entertaining - and very sad in the case of many stories. Its end, in particular, is heart broken and well done exceptionally. There were a few particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Ellen McMahon as the main nurse. All in all, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they feel they have to reproduce the film only a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
