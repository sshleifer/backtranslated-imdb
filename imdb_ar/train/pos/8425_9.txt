I finally saw these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back and check the time of their production already. They are very scary because they ridiculed the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and saw the folly of the Bush governor or they were strange strangers who cared about things. Boo, scary! Bush Brothers invaded the White House dressed in Arab uniforms with guns? Bush "accidentally" executed someone? (No, wait, he did it as governor). This may have seemed like a failure in the sitcom at the time, but it should now be considered a wonderful recipe, if it is scary.
