Maybe that's because I'm very scared of hospitals and medical stuff, but this is my skin (pardon the pun). This piece is courageous and not afraid of overstepping the top and satisfying because it comes in terms of revenge films. I did not feel much of a hatred towards the screwdriver and a lot of sympathy for the "spiral", but I felt myself and felt disgusted at some of the stages that are rare and very enjoyable for somewhat pessimistic horror scenes like myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but they bear fruit rather than imitation. It's a heavy piece that does not give the viewer much thought, but I enjoy attacking the film once and for a moment. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I liked them so much. Do not watch while eating dessert.
