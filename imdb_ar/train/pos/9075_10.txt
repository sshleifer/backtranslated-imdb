I missed almost all of the first season, but when the other shows started to come back, I started to watch. I ended up buying the entire first season of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy programs. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor made me trade all the time. David Speed ​​is funny, but sometimes Russell goes a long way. I enjoy the other cast members more (but I do not say it does not add to the show). <br /> <br /> Offer yourself a service. If you have not unchecked, try it. If you can see the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series will have a long time.
