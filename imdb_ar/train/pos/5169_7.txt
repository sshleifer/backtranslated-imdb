I watched the last five or ten minutes of this film in 1998 or 1999 one night when I was browsing the channel before going to bed, and I really loved what I saw. Since then, I have been watching closely, looking for TV listings and jumping through DVD / VHS racks in stores, but I did not find a copy until recently when I discovered that some online stores sold them. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, I still did not ask for it. Finally, I found a copy of the DVD in the Circuit City while visiting Portland, a few weeks ago. Then it took about a month after I went home before sitting and watching. <br /> <br /> So, what is my opinion in the film? this is good. Not as good as I remembered and hope, but still worth $ 9.99 cost me that. After watching the whole movie for the first time I set it as 7/10, with the possibility of becoming 8/10. I have to be less sleepy, and get a better sound system to avoid getting back down to pick up some dialogue.
