Local import was a great film. I laughed all the time. He was funny on many levels of crazy groups to hilarious positions. The acting was wonderful. Alla Corot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hessman, and all the others have done a wonderful job. Because it is an independent film written by a writer for the first time, it does not contain the clich√©s expected from other comics, which were a relief. It has been unique and interesting and lies in the love of characters and the story of warming. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, this is hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this film.
