This is what I wrote to some friends earlier: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge, Honest to God, is one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen! I either feel very sleepy, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures make KICK A **! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was too afraid to sit in the dark theater and wished I were someone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge.) I saw the film by myself) There are many jump scenes that were not expected! I felt stupid but my nerves did not bother! I was on the edge of the entire film, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. I'm still thinking about this sound, I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I was shaken loudly several times, and cried, "Oh" in one scene !! Oh, yeah, so I've covered my eyes several times! Say to the wise, though: I thought some scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated "Event Horizon" and I thought that each of his books was sick and psychological, but I do not remember the film, so I can not compare. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "enjoyed" this movie b / I was terrified, but it was very good and very scary. End scene, too ... Stand up! As a 32-year-old mother, I think I might get nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In short, this is not as close a flick as I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). It's a nervous movie most of the time. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great movie trailers were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
