I saw this on a flight to the United States and I was skeptical at first. A few people said there were so many people I did not recognize. Yet I did not find this at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes they may be predictable but this is not true for most movies. The main villain is a kind of frustration, Christopher Ecclestone is not as persuasive as he could have been, but this he said is still a good film.
