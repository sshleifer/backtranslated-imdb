Secret of Kells is one of the most beautiful and unique animated films. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that there was nothing to give up running for money and it was hard to win in this category, but I found Kells a serious competitor. <br /> <br /> The Secret Bride tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Abbot Kell. Abbot is a loving guardian, but he may be much tougher and much more interested in fortifying the wall around the city than coming from the Vikings than caring for the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Idan (who looks like Willy Nelson is amazing) comes and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a trip to the forest and meets a beautiful forest fairy called Aisling, whom he admires (and saves his life more than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book that the legend says can turn into darkness. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
