This movie was so wonderful! I am a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it is clear that these films attract attention to all age groups. I have recommended it to everyone. My favorite line in this film is when Logan Bartholomew says: "cheeks are pink" when he talks about his infant daughter. He is a wonderful actor, as is Erin Cotrell. They are well connected, they have great chemistry! I really hope that they can work together again. They are attractive people, and they are very good representatives. I finally found good movies to watch. It has been hard for me recently to find good films and show moral values ​​and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not cheese.
