Robot Jox tries hard, but it's basically a series of combative combat scenes together - robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. The assumption had potential, but it seems that the script really did not give a larger number of drafts it needed. However, it was fairly good, for a science fiction film. Part of it was because the text was by Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote an award-winning science fiction novel, "The Forever War." She is considered one of the best combat armor novels, there with Robert Henleyn "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". This film is really like the giant battle shield film, rather than the giant robots. It is closer to what the fans wanted than to the falsification of Paul Verhofen's Paul Versteven, which was only like the novel on which it was based. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions Homer relies on the Iliad. There are a few common names between them. Achilles after his foot exploded in his robot was unparalleled in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. Akhel was not a noble warrior. He was the strongest, but he was also retaliation and trivial. Even the robot Jock who was killed in the first scene does not fit. His name was Hercules, while the Greek Iliads would receive Herakles. <br /> <br /> The effects were fairly good for time and budget. True, it was not similar to "Terminator 2" a year later, but the cost of this movie tenfold. The traffic was almost as good as the motorized walkers in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Better, in fact, than a lot of animation for Ray Harihosen, which is highly appreciated, but largely dated. <br /> <br /> Do not bring great expectations to this and may not disappoint you. It's better than a lot of other low-budget clicks and even some types of wannabes with huge budgets that have better effects but much worse texts.
