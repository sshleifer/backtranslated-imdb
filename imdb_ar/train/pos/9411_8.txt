Sidney Stratton faces a problem in maintaining jobs in various textile plants, mainly because of his experience in textile plants. Stratton is experimenting with a new formula for the fabric that will create the final fabric, the tissue that never gets dirty, never creases, and does not wear. When Stratton creates the fabric in the end, it creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and owners (who will lose money because one mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The movie was perfect and only Iling made it as well. The performance of Guinness (and wonderful supporting actors such as Greenwood, Tysiger and Parker) and the direction of MacDendrick make the film a delight, but the real hero is the same story, a nice satire in business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Evaluation, 8.
