I am grateful to CÃ©sar Montano and his crew for reviving the once-hugely acclaimed film Fizi. We hope that "Panaghoy" will be a pioneer in the return of this colloquial language (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The details of the dialect and lifestyle vividly recall this region of the Philippines. Downside: The vulgar and vile representation of the American enemy. The other element I did not appreciate was the lack of originality in the same "character" period and, above all, his bright red car, which I suppose was meant to pass through the Roadster in the 1930s. Without these small but stark details, the "Panaghoy" was at least 9 out of 10 in my rating - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! The film certainly surpasses the film "Ouro, Plata, Mata" by Piccolo Gallagna, who presented a different view of Visayas during World War II. Also, there are some parts where the cinema goes back to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the story of the film reminds us of "Noli Me Tangere".
