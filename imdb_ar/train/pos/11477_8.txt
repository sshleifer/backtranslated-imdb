In my honest opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. It really put things in perspective as I watched it. Although it was fantastical, this film revolves around something that can happen to your children. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two children hide their hatred of their school and plan to kill innocent students. This movie will not work in any other way. They pulled the handheld camera completely. <br /> <br /> This reminds us on April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Clebold killed 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to watch Rampart video and everyone wanted to watch Basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic version of our dreams come true. We recognize the child who stands behind the beast. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it has not produced good results in the market, and even few people know it exists. If there was supposed to be one preview on one of the popular films, everyone would have gone to see how big the deal was, on Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best movie to film the school of the few that I really tried. The filming itself takes about 10 minutes from an hour and a half long film, because it focuses mostly on Cal and Andr√©, and what they have done until this point. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, go and rent it, and watch it. I guarantee that when you are done, you will be speechless.
