This is an excellent DVD stand-up! Eddie Eisard is the most person I've seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes a wonderful conversation with others who have seen it. I highly recommend this. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the jokes ending in French are very good, because you do not have to speak French to get them (although if you do, it's still funny). Also, the parts about being a very good transsexual. The first scene (around San Francisco) is not wonderful, but funny the first time. Skip those if you can. Hardly worth watching. However, this is a funny and funny show that everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
