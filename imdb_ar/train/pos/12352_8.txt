I and my friend enjoyed this film a lot. The scenes were pulled away from modern life to ancient Japan while at the same time exposed to very current subjects. The characters are realistic and detailed. It has an end and an unpredictable story, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of small pieces in the lives of many soldiers who live together in a poor area of ​​the city. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in realistic romance or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
