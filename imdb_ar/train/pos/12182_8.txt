I did not do a movie search before his first watch because he was part of the Welles box box I recently bought. The box set I got mainly because I wanted to own a "man for all seasons" as well as to re-evaluate Waterloo. So I comment Orson and Rita in the player and I am treated with equal grade and confusion. <br /> <br /> On the roof, the story looks simple, the man meets a wonderful woman and saves her from a couple of thugs, they click immediately and the man gets on the show to work on a cruise with a woman and her husband the famous lawyer, then ....... ...... <br /> <br /> .. The mystery becomes the murder of Satan decree and a lot of geniuses. Orson Welles himself does not really know what is happening, it is as confused as the scenes, and this is great for watching where it is attracted everywhere by everyone in the film. It is obvious that she is pulled out of the strings of the heart by a beautiful woman of beauty like Elsa Panister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, but you know that things will become pear. <br /> <br /> Many of the wonderful things in the film, featuring the visual Wills style everywhere, see a scene in a fabulous aquarium and the ending sequences in a majestic and majestic house on the eye. The narration of O'Hara mocks himself with pleasure, and we get a good relief of light by a case in court with Everett Sloane illuminating greatly the proceedings. <br /> <br /> However, the film is bizarre, which is actually a volatile viewing experience, because {as you will discover it after cutting the heads of the studio film for a full hour, this is not only frustrating for us to the viewer, but unfair to see Wales . I am sure that a full original part of this film would have been praised and honored in bulk, since we have a good and intriguing film, unfortunately only hinting at greatness, but it remains a very interesting film. I am happy to have more to visit. 8.5 / 10
