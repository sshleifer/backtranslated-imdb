I loved this show and I still watch DVDs for the first season at the age of 19 years. What can I say? I grew up in a house very much like the house in Full House. I had my father and two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference is that I did not live with my uncle and my father's favorite friend. Also, I grew up with my mom at home. I do not know what I would have done without Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Judy Sweetin), DJ. (Played by Kirk's sister Cameron Candice), and Michelle (played by Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steve, I am a younger sister like Michelle, I am a big sister like DJ. I really like how the exhibition always has moral values ​​because I do not really like any of the shows today. I love Full House comedy too. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joy (Dave Collier) and Danny (Bob Sageet) Farhanin as cousins ​​and friend of my father and father respectively. The story says that after the death of the girl's mother, Jesse, Danny's best friend and son-in-law, moves to help raise the children. Three men trying to raise three young girls. Every character in Full House is full of heart, funny and truly credible. Joey is an ambitious comedy that has the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a scooter, his powerful uncle who was relieved by his three sisters, and his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. content.
