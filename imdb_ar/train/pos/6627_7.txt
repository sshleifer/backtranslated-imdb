Scanner, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City, Sky Captain and tomorrow's world? If you're a fan of any of these, it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The French animation project "Renaissance" took seven years to present a simple budget. Tonight, I finally saw it at a special screening of the International Film Festival in Stockholm. Spontaneous reaction. My additional thinking is "huh, neat" and the careful analysis unfortunately gets a loud "hey". It is a wonderful science fiction that triumphs over the surface, but it is shamed or even deceived a little and its complex plots are unnecessarily obvious as flat figures do. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that people in Onyx movies have done an amazing job with the above-mentioned surface. The pictures are amazing. They used the live animation technique embedded in the animation frame, with striking black and white contradictions and a heavily shaded background. For those of you who do not fall into the "technical language", the movie looks like a fully animated City Sen. Its fluid, transparent and dark mold is complete with a large sparkle. It's a vision. However, much of the credit is also due to the sound effects of future weaponry, suspicious music, heavy rain drops and broken glass. It is an innovative dream for every technologist ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the dimly lit, dark Paris where a major company, Avalon, has begun to interfere with the lives of citizens who have surveillance (think of transparent fluid screens from the minority report) And genetic engineering. The latter leads to the mysterious abduction of the young researcher Elona (expressed by Jamil Romai Garai). Cut to the tough cop on the commentary and hero Karas (Daniel Craig)? A man takes the law into his hands? Which is assigned if found and recovered Ilona. During this case, he is assisted by the sister of Illona which also begins with a love affair. A love relationship is very unequal, if I may say so. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance world is wonderful. The filmmaker Christian Volkman takes a fair blow in melting Noir's themes. The result is an urban forest full of children, mice, female dead and the only investigators hiding in the slums. The problem is that creators undoubtedly felt the need for clear and highly written models in the story, or that the film was "very surreal" for mainstream audiences, given its mobile coordination. It follows that we have many vulgar characters like the wicked who laugh at the villain, the heads of the miserable crime, and slay the harsh scream that blows smoke at every opportunity they get. It is hard on our faces, not necessary. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the dialogue is a bit disillusioned. It seems as if each line exists for the sole reason to drive the plot. This is not a fatal thing because the plot is very complex once you need a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps here by bringing a meaningless position to his powerful fierce personality. At some point in the Renaissance, he was seen chasing live cars that are certainly one of the most adrenaline pumping chains and the highest degree of film. Unfortunately, the novelty of science fiction images has faded after chasing this car and could benefit "Renassaince" from being a little shorter. In short, the experience of a futuristic comic book is very interesting but flawed. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
