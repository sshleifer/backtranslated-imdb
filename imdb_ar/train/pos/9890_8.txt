Unfortunately, this movie never reached a DVD. I saw it when it was first put on theaters in 1983, then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw the VHS version in a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, what is clear: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and joy to behold. But then, the film takes you to an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and determine what is really important to you. The film revolves around a lot of things. It is about how the World Bank and big corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capital schemes to force them to pay off debts they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us to pay off debts with credit cards, mortgages, and car payments. It is about trying to save the patent that we may never have faced and perhaps can not really save. It revolves around good and evil and about how difficult it is to tell one another at times. It raises a lot of questions but does not provide answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this film really deserves the rescue and vision.
