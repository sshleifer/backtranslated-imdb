I went to see Anton Fischer do not know what to expect, I was surprised with greater pleasure. The acting work of Derek Locke was fantastic and the story line was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington performed his usual duties in acting and directing. Makes you realize that people with mental problems can help them and this film is a perfect example of it. Do not miss this one.
