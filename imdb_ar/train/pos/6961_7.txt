I got the attention of the title and then I wondered what would happen in the plot, where we saw a lot of "superman" movies these years ... In fact, I really liked it, as there were a number of unusual movies funny scenes I did not expect. Uma Thurman performed as an average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to see her toes again in a wide screen (as at the beginning of Bill Bell). But Luke Wilson played the role of the foolish man who meets the big woman very well, and I can really get to his position. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and Average Matt, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
