This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a well-known classic novel to me. The Court of Chancery's representation as a "character" in the drama is wonderful. The wonderful acting, from the evil Tulkinghorn, to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte, and two young lovers. But the spider web of poems is that brings everything together, and cinematic photography is wonderful. What is the BBC's copyright infringement, which means that this version can not be seen in the UK on both video and DVD for many years? I tried to find out, but I encountered a stone wall. In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada.
