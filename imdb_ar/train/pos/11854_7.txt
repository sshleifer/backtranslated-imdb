I agree with "Jerry". It's a superfluous movie (of course, how many good low-budget movies are not being underestimated?) If I remember correctly, solving the puzzle was a sort of difference (but not a "rip") of 2001 because the computer that controls a ship Space was already a man, which somehow turned into a computer. Like the HAL, they tried to separate his "mind", but not the mechanical parts of it, and as with HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When you find the character of Christopher Carey, who can not find any food, the abandoned pet bird, there is a kind of ominous moment, but the obvious thing does not happen after all.
