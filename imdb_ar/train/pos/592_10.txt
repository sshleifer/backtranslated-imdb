In Arlington Heights, Illinois, we did not have a cafeteria in any primary school (1961), so I rode my bike home from school for lunch and I always watched this game. True, I was eleven years old, but I thought it was the greatest thing! I was painting hidden pictures on my blackboard and seeing if my family or friends could find them. I also remember winning great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the contestant got the final game hidden. I even had a home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted for a while. I enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only picture I could get was the hidden lemon as part of a bridge over a garden course. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are associated with camouflage.
