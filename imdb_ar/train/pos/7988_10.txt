I was disturbed all the time by my family and friends because of my tears on the movies, and were not disappointed when I saw this movie. I cried many times but believe me it is not over. I have suffered for the family and I am suffering for this man as he tries to recover himself in the only way he knows how. Denzel was fantastic as always, as was Chris and McCain. Mickey Rourke, so I did not know it; the years were not nice with him. My husband does not have anyone watching movies unless they are historically accurate (Snore !!!!). I have watched this movie 5 times now and I will have to get a DVD to watch it again because it is out of the bar and jumped all the time I was watching.
