As a sequencer, this is not a bad film. I really liked it better than the first movie. I found it more enjoyable. It seemed to be filmed in a documentary style. At first, this bothered me, as I think it looked very low budget. But it grew on me, and made the film seem more authentic. This film contains more dry linings than the original, which is good, in my opinion. I think sometimes they went to the top a bit with some sights and personalities. It becomes almost a parody of itself, which may be a point. This film at least has some suspense, which was not the first, in my opinion. Music of origin, which is wonderful. The acting was again pretty fit for the most part, although I said, some of it seemed to be at the top. I also felt that the film loses a lot of momentum in the end and there are a few minutes that look really slow and do not seem to flow, like the rest of the movie. However, I think this was an integral part of the film. The classification of y for "back to the cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
