Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in the last ice age of the planet, while Captain Kirk in the same colonial period of the planet. However, he is the former spouse who has the most trying times. Besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary that can only be found in the caves, there is a third inhabitant, very beautiful and exciting (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this age, slowly begins to return to the behavioral patterns of his predecessors, feels the natural attraction of Zerubith and casts "caution out of the wind" about leaving this place at all. Only with Dr. McCoy's "reminders" persistent, Spock held some understanding of reality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few times that the character shows some "emotion" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it to the extreme, and approaches the bejesus output of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly to the previous batch, Captain Kirk (William Schattner) was not allowed to get the girl, in addition to this other girl. <br /> <br /> The old man Ian Wolf plays the role of Mr. Attoz, the librarian responsible for sending the trio to the past.
