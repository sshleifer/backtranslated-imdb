Dick Tracy is one of my favorites all the time. I must admit to those who have not seen it. You will really love her or really hate her. Came out a year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so high that many simply failed because the plot was very simple. But based on the comic strip ... What do you expect? Creatively, this film is amazing! The collections, makeup, music, fashion and stunning performance make this movie great. The film contains non-blood violence and bad language - and this is rare these days. Directed, produced and starred as Betty Warren as an Ace crime fighter climbs up against the evil Pachino Big Boy Caprice and his gang of thugs. Madonna steals the show as a breathless Mahoney adventurer. This is one of the best characters that Madonna has ever played. She has the best one hardcore I've heard! Madonna fans will love! One of the coolest things in the film is that they used only seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is really a piece of artwork that is unfortunately overlooked by the public. To summarize things, this film shows the child in us all. It's a movie that will make you smile in the end.
