I was not just an extra person in this film, but I saw it in Boston to a cinema sold out. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farelli fans jammed a movie theater near Boston Comon to see comedy .... about them ... Red Sox fanatics Drew Barrymore star Jimmy Fallon is a nice comedy about love and lust. Love between young lovers. Desire to win the Red Sox World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor in this role. It's funny enough and gets more laughter. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes, I felt that supporting actress Ione Sky was the best actor in this role. All in all, Boston Red Sox lovers will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny film.
