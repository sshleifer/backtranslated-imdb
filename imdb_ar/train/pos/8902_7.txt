I imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would remain an icon and the movie "Wanted: Dead" in the same year that the film appeared, or was in The Magnificent Seven two years later, he did not. But he did it, and we are richer than that. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is a classic camp. Horror the way the theater was supposed to be by car. It's fun and fun. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cool. <br /> <br /> They could not have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would melt. Blob will return soon.
