A delightful simple send from Romeo and Juliet. Approach with no expectations other than having a fun time and you will enjoy this one. A talented group of comic actors left a riot in the car of the lukewarm performers. The reviews were bad because of ridicule about Shakespeare's treatments. Some people feel that all movies should be "important" --- if you share these views, do not bother. Angelina Jolie's credits, which are not even close to being real, but stunningly beautiful as Juliet's character, and as always, her acting gorgeous ---, given her age at the time, read her credits so good. Rewriting this classic story with Italian families in the food-serving New York City is a great pleasure. See it in the right frame of mind will laugh out loud.
