I can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just a genius! It certainly does not follow the tried and true experience, but do we as consumers always want to pay the same things to us over and over. We should not have the option of sitting and enjoying something new from time to time. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it's not supposed to be. The show, entitled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue," which is part of this title, states that actors who are fully loved by other renditions will always join the event. He does not say anywhere that they will solve the puzzles, and they can not even stand on the monsters, so why do they do? I am actually happy because they have put some long plot points running in Scooby Doo's show. They are still running jokes, clumsy, quiet games, fast-changing costumes in chase scenes, the standard hallway frenzy and even snacks from Skopje. In fact I am happy because this offer exists, because I love it. I'm glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and focused on two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> It's certainly ridiculous, it's supposed to be! Sure it's different, supposed to be. It is supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and cheer for the stupid automated win that wins over the extreme margins, regardless of size. You are supposed to get a joke "Roobi-Roo" ongoing. The whole thing has been compiled well, there is not one thing I can think of as a mistake. Writing, acting, animation, first class. The title music is fantastic (my computer runs "GET A CLUE!" At startup) and picks up background music.
