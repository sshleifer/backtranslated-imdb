This is a modest, personal comedy filmed in Brazil with a low budget. The premise is familiar, as in Danny Kay in 1950 ** On the Double **: Someone, as a joke, makes an impression of a famous person and then is dragged into impersonating the real person. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two is very effective. Raul Julia as a German policeman Baraduria, tall, cool, threatened, Latino. It sports the blond dye function deliberately clear. Richard Dreyfus, animation, short, Jewish New York, funny and sympathetic. There are many references and jokes about business presentations. <br /> <br /> The setting is clearly designed on Paraguay. Paraguay has already been ruled from the early 1950s until the late 1980s by General Alfredo Stroessner, the uneducated military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany. But director Mazurski reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Paraguay as a typical tyranny of Latin America, with huge disparities in wealth and an active insurgency in guerrilla warfare. Moreover, Mazursky cast the comic film Jonathan Winters as an American retiree in fact is C.I.A. The head of the station in Baradur and a character so strong that he could give the president a foul taste. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, which is not without much of the social and ethnic tensions we are seeing elsewhere in the region. This is because the country has fought long and costly wars against its larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost eliminated in both cases but the community that emerged was nationally, ethnically homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level, there is bowing to the women's movement in the form of Madonna's character. Madonna played the role of Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, a former dancer in a nightclub, a stolen, body-full-fledged presidential girl at the beginning of the film, but seen on television as her boss in the end - now politically correct and aesthetically pleasing, Velvet. <br /> <br /> The only time such an event actually took place in Latin America, Argentina's Isabelle Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never took office) continued to be two years after her husband's death, the legendary ** Supreme ** Juan Peron.
