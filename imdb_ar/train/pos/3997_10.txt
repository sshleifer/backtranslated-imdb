What a moving film. I have my dear friend in her sixties and over the past fifteen years, he told me that people have not seen her anymore, and she longs for companionship. In my late 40s, I began to see what she was complaining about. You are no longer young, beautiful or tangible. When May says "... this block of body ..." wow. How our body changes and how we are told it is no longer beautiful. I love when you start to change what you wear ... colored scarf ... no longer a sad wife. <br /> <br /> It is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sad in that she may betray the trust of her daughter ... beautiful because she finds herself through the difficulty of the case, and choose to move forward and her own life in the end. I love personal daring so that I start a love relationship. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I like the film because in the end it is a picture that illustrates the complex nature of relationships, whether family or not. We see Paola's weakness, but she will get what she wants at all costs ... (When she tells her mother she will give birth to a child to Darren whether he wants to or not after asking her mother if Darren wants a child). The film highlights how relationships can change, but reveals what it has been all along. May has strangled her own creativity to raise the family. The family did not really want it, but it was "something I just did when it was small." She liked the scene when Darren called it an old tart, smiling and saying, "I've never heard of it before." It was really a jewel film. <br /> <br /> Daniel Craig. Well, I just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is it nice to the eyes, it's a real talent. What an elegant role. It is much more than any 007 and this is certain and I look forward to seeing it in more roles than this nature. The scene that is pleasing in May and the shape he gives her is a kind of wonderful look that he has such control over this woman, and also the pleasure of being able to give her this. He actually enjoys giving her happiness. Fantastic contrast scene is a love scene with Bruce. Bruce absorbs completely his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately ... I wonder where is my Darren?
