Excellent view. Instead of watching the same kind of old sitcom that shows the same old thing, just different "stars", this refreshing show made an incredible entertainment show for office spaces. We have stayed away from watching any TV for two years, and after returning, for all available offers, we look forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global to pull the plug on this program. I thought this would be a winner. Let's be realistic, many Canadian offers make it a reality. Everyone I talk to enjoys this offer and I think it was stupid for Global to go away. I think they want to stick to the typical mental anesthesia offerings from the United States instead of backing away from a very promising Canadian offer. Do not miss me, I enjoy many programs on TV, but, let's keep the diversity. This unique presentation made a very comedic view of a somewhat exaggerated factual aspect of the office life and its relationships, with unique characters you do not see on any comic programs today or in the past. It is very bad that global should say no to this error, stupid mistake.
