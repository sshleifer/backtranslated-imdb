I saw this premiere of the Friday film (1/19) night at Park City for Sundance, which was incredibly moved. It was sitting in the theater and hearing the children of the soldiers who were suffering more than I could endure. Others were moved from the audience evenly and although we wanted to get away, the least we could do was to witness because these men and women shared their experience with us. The event was attended by Robert Acosta, Paul Reekhoff, Sean Hoz and Herold Noel, all veterans of the Iraq war who appeared in the film. While they may be home now, you can say that this war is still inside and perhaps will be. Whether you support the war or not, we have to support the troops with something other than the bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
