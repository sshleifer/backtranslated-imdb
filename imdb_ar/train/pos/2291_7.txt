Perhaps the most important two of the most important "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" is that an idiot leporid appeared in "A Wild Hare" now has a name, and he pronounces his famous "Of course you realize that this means war!" for the first time. Mostly, the "Termite Terrace" crowd was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this long-necked villain. It is certainly indispensable for enthusiasts of this kind, but others may have little reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But no one is wrong, it is very fun for Bugs Bunny to do with the eternal geezer Elmer Vood. Clear shades of objects are spread throughout the animation. I highly recommend it.
