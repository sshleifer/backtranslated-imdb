I did not give this film a full grade in order to be honest in comparing great classics such as "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai". However, this film is very cool, it is a real disgrace that is very bad for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter tends to an eccentric genius, and "Pauli" does not qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only positive criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not envision the faltering ideal child. I'm sorry, but when I ask a 6-year-old child to surpass Dorsten Hoffman because Rainman asks the impossible in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> If we go beyond that simple complaint, the film has the best of many films: Friends Trip, Social Games, Heroes as a friendly party animal (a party bird?), and a spirit like Disney for young and old, and so on. What do not you like? Tony Shalop wears his role as a pair of comfortable jeans. This is normal for him, it seems. ("I'm Rossi ... I love the long stories.) I do not like mango, but it almost makes me want to go out and buy one, see the movie and that makes sense." <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin In the film, roles perfectly suited to what we all know about them, I have always found that Jay Mohr is a little thin, and his role on the screen fits that too. The only surprise I encountered was that Jay was also Paulie's voice, and finally, that was good; Parrot together as a team and creates its own magic. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a movie for you and the children do not insult and boring, "Paulie" is the candidate Perfect, however, I will admit that a happy moment looms my assessment of "Paulie." He was on a road trip during a major heat wave.The air conditioning in the car died, half of the restaurants were suffering from cold death (as our hotel did) and I said, "Let's watch a movie Where there is an air conditioner that works. So for 100 minutes, we cooled and had a warm experience of the heart, and when I last saw him on VCR under less emotional conditions, I realized how good this film was. <br /> <br /> It's a sleepless film that will not regret it.
