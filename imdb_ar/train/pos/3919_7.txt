While training on Carmen Bizet, Antonio Antonio (Gadez) middle-aged designer Carmen (Laura del Sol) brings a leading role. Antonio is in love with Carmen, an independent and mischievous woman unable to accept the love of the property. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by jealousy such as d. Jose in the original opera, which connects fantasy and reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another wonderful film about Carlos Saora's dedicated Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story has been developed with the lives of interlocking artists with the characters they train on, and many times it is not quite clear whether what is happening is reality (with dancers) or fantasy (the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction for this original version of the famous Bizet opera, based on the novel Prosper Mérimée. Seven voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
