I have loved this film all my life. It's also a clever story, with lots of classic hints. For example. The ship that had been lost for decades was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical legends, this man was the one who killed the illusion, a mythical monster consisting of two or more other creatures. In the FP, it is clear that Walter Pidgeon is the same delusion and brutality. <br /> <br /> I like the movies that the book is clearly attributed to their audience with a little intelligence, unlike most modern films that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 on a screenplay. /> Cheers
