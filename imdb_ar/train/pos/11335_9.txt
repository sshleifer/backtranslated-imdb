Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer as well as Pan's Labyrinth's imagination. Even the beginning of your influence seems to give a signal to the Pan Labyrinth. But this is the story that takes place in modern times, not in war 60 years ago, and in this way it has a greater resonance today. Jake Clozette is about a boy, a single child, practically alone on summer leave, dealing with his collapsed family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror film for someone who thinks. If you are looking for a slanted film, you will not have this cup of tea but if you are looking for an impressive and impressive story with good disposition, this is the right movie for you. In the show I saw, I swore that there was a moment when the entire audience screamed. I highly recommend watching this movie.
