This movie only shows that you do not need big blasts, computer graphics worth $ 1 billion, or reps and reps to make a good movie. Who master all the Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa sets out brilliantly. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes an epic piece. And for those who enjoy the former Kurosawas business. 10/10
