Rules of personal taste when it comes to talking about films such as these small gems. Back in the 1980s, in the early 1980s, the film, like many others released at the time, discovered "Night Patrol", "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", works of art and shocks on the back of the covers were lured and canceled. <br /> <br /> Of course, because of age, such films have already been mentioned in addition to things like "Screwballs" and many other films, and captured the imagination, and fortunately after several years I still remember some loathing and others Many despise films that help keep my love for this kind of parody or pastiches. <br /> <br /> After many years of the incredible success of Animal House and seeing how it has fallen over the years, I know now that there will be no way for this film to outperform the box office box office, as mentioned Previously, it will not remain in memory, just like the National Lampoon holiday. <br /> <br /> Honestly, not all that carried the National Lampoon logo was a huge success. I'm Class Reunion one of my favorite movies all the time, with recognizable characters right away, like the perfect Bob Spinker played by Gareth Graham, Very much in the film Charles Band which bears the name Charles Band, which still stands in the glories of his past youth. Or what about the screams of Stephen Forrest and turned into balls when he was a lazy drunk sex in high school Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet like. Which makes me think. As I already said, personal taste does not carry. People can be very tough, so they will never win any prizes or compare with their peers in the world of comedy. It has some merit. As one of the previous scripts written by John Hughes, who later went on to do one of his favorite "foreign science" works as well as a great theme title sung by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What can I say more, it's a film waiting to be rediscovered again and again.
