I've just watched this for the first time in a long time - I've forgotten all the imagination in the pictures and the intelligence of the film. But I did not forget the scenes of the opening scenes (with a scene at the Candlelight Club at Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic films ever shot. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or the distant history of the film will love anyone who is interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who likes the visuals will enjoy filming the other world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is "Odd Man Out", which was created near the same time - but this is a great one. <br /> <br />
