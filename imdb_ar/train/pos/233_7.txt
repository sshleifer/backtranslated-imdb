I actually found this movie "interesting". Finally one deserves my time to watch and rent. This is true ... some scenes were in the forefront about passion, shouting, etc., but what film does not emphasize his agenda or type or "ax to be grinded"? Almost nothing! What surprised me was that I read a review elsewhere by one of the reviewers at S.Fran on another review site, but his negative review instead found a more accurate description of his "own" review of the film; it was not the film at all. Anyone watching this movie will realize it's great to recommend family and friends; no car chases, yes! Being "in an Italian family myself, I can relate entirely to the environment that was filmed on the screen. The film has tear jitter parts as well. This is what real life can be in such an environment. nice movie.
