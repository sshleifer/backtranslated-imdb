He came by surprise. . The effect of solving this film is an automatic way to respond to people and attitudes. The most irritating was passion. Much like the way a spoiled child responds to a lack of walking. . Anger if you will. Thinking that I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce at all. What was this costing me? Sooo much love. . Lots of graces. I now introduce to the sense of humility surprisingly, I have a constant attitude of gratitude for life. . As for what is happening right now, my wild expectations for life are a certain way, in the way that I think life or people "must be". This film contributed to the freedom I feel now to communicate with others, without limits and expectations. . . And connect with true love. . . Without fear of loss. . Only in love first, accept what is given love.
