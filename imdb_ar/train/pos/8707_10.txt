"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films I have ever seen. The name of the movie can be translated in English as "sword holder". The main hero (Sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the very sharp sword that comes out from beneath his skin in his hand. On the first side, he could seem a more idiotic hero than a senseless film about unrealistic events and feelings. But they are not around the Mechenosets. Hardly can even be called anti-hero. I think he is just someone who lost the claim in his life and his faith in good, justice and love. In his life he never met anyone he understood and loved (except for his mother). Each step is stained with blood. He takes revenge on everyone for his gift which has become a curse for him. And suddenly meet her. It does not need idle talks and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She does not care what he did. The fact that it is next to her is more important than anything else. But he soon discovered his secret: two people (her ex-boyfriend and bodyguard) were killed to protect her in front of her eyes. Even after that she could not escape her feelings. They are trying to run but hard to hide. Finally they have a serious car accident. She is locked up; she is in a mental hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she thinks he will save her. He overcame many obstacles but finally found them. They run again but are not at risk. She is sick and needs rest, but the police arrest them. He does not know what to do, they drive in a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, and a helicopter around them, but needless to, because she has already died in his arms, a single person in the whole world again.
