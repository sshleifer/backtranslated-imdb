Eddie Isard is no less a comic genius, and Eddie is at his best. His materials are very ingenious and playful, and his delivery is some of the best he has seen on stage. Instead of insulting the intelligence of the public, he relies on him to draw the humor of his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British. With a lot of memorable laughter, one can only repeat some of his lines. Forever, "Do you have knowledge?" One of the delivered lines should be considered in the standup routine. All Starbucks stand-up fans need to see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Isard struggled for success outside the stage. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not be an indication of how true his talent is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, has happily found its way to home video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
