"Red Rock West," a beautiful old film that looks like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, follows the adventures of the veteran oil worker Mr. N.Cage while his luck turns worse after he finishes the empty gas tank and barely enough money For a cup of coffee in one town at the back of the behind. It has been proven from the start that Mr. Cage may have fallen but did not come out, and may be broken but will not steal, even in his current difficult circumstances. And certainly when Mr. JT makes mistakes. Walsh For the man who assigned him to kill his wife, Mr. Cage calls the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions. In contrast, in her person Miss LFBoyle, give her more money to kill Mr. Walsh. Mr. Cage decides to leave while still at the front but as he drives out of town he hits a man on the road. Since he may be able to drive, he takes the man to the hospital, where he turns out to have been shot. Mr. Cage was detained by deputies who call Sheriff who turned out to be Mr. JTWalsh. The events take a more complex turn when Mr.Cage avoids the difficulty of escaping from the real blow on his way to accomplishing his mission. But now it is forgiven for thinking "already enough", but because it happens on the screen seems a logical turn of events, and it seems that the narrative flow of the film at this stage can not be stopped. Mr. D. Hopper is considered comfortable as a tenant killer, such as Mr. Cage, a veteran of USMC. This little piece of chance keeps Mr. Cage alive for long enough to think of a triple killer and survive, a little more beating but still unburned. It is a tribute to all concerned that what looks on paper in a wonderful way like a piece of nonsense is actually a very tense picture with fantastic performances in all respects. Red Rock West. Within five minutes you know you're going somewhere you've been on many occasions before, but you'll be very happy during the trip.
