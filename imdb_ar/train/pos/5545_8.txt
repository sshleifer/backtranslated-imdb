**** Includes Vandals **** <br /> <br /> I've been a horror movie fan now for decades. Just when I think I saw all the other great pop-ups to surprise me. I have not seen this movie before. It was a treat, off the beaten path too ... not only the way to the swamp ferry boat either. Here was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something completely different. The beautiful girl is (swallowing) fear of change and saves men, including the man you love, from the beast! How is this to evolve. This girl was the complete opposite of most women in films at that time, do not scream at her shadows, do not be afraid of fear, do not run down on a paper she works. She was not afraid to live alone in a secluded shack away from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a foggy swamp rumored to be haunted. They even take a nap on the lawn in the outdoor swamp ... like the regular 1940s version of Ripley. No snake, crocodile or ghostly gorge dares to disturb these gal. Books that deal with early female films should be made sure of this work that has been ignored. <br /> <br /> Watch this if you are a fan of the fantastic classic B / W horror movies you made in the 1930s. Make sure to wear the turtle's neck made of cast iron for protection.
