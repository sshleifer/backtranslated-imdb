This film made 8 out of 10, kept 10 films for example Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge this film without understanding the Balkan life, mental and spirit that Kosturica offers brilliantly. To understand this, you must be truly Balkan. It is an amazing film, much better and more contemporary than its previous films, which are boring at this time, and I think that Kosturica is moving forward in this film. I love humor (Balkan humor), photography is the art itself, every art scene to the limit. The story may be a myth, you do not remember now, but remember to read to my daughter who intends a similar story.
