Since September of last year, I have borrowed between four and six films a week from the Harold Washington Library, which includes an impressive collection of DVDs. (The HWL library is really a bookstore: three-quarters of her films have come out in no time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find David Lynch's short films. Yesterday, with little knowledge about the animation series, Dumbland picked up. I'm here to report that for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is half an hour spent well. Each episode has its own rhythm. The respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract provide percussion. Harsh voices stop their ends. Physical violence extends impulses. Pulsating pulsars and noisy plugs echo along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. Asynchronous animation is often synonymous with sound, but the soundtrack itself has surprised me as Lynch's primary interest in creating and publishing this work. In a way, these eight short films are unique Lycian rhythms. <br /> <br /> However, the positions are strange, stupid, deep, stupid and funny like hell. There is enough room inside them to think about how ridiculous we humans are. I can not say I'll see the group again, but for anyone celebrating the Inland Empire moves, Dumbland deserves half an hour of your time.
