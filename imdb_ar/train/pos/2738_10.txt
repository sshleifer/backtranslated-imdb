I have not seen this for more than 20 years but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This film could not be made in color. It was ashes that made it, and life was so simple in the fifties ?? What stands out most in my memory is going to Perry Smith to the gallows. Breathe under the cover immediately before the trap blows. I do not think I can see it again ..... once a lot. It is such a man who was not named at the beginning of "Papillon" who was dragged into terrorism to the guillotine. The person who said this saw a double bill with "Dead Man Walking" had to add another 10 minutes of "I want to live" as well. <br /> <br /> To the Guillotine in 1794-95 so my feelings about the death penalty are fairly severe.
