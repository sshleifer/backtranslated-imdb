Blob is a flick for the classic B-1950 movie. You may know the story: two young men (Steve McQueen and Anita Korsot) see a meteor hitting the ground, and when they go looking for it, they run to an old man with some alien ... attached to his arm. They take him to the doctor's office, then they go to see what happened. From there, dot dot, and eat each person on their way. Special effects are fun cheesy, as is the story. There are a lot of great touches, like a cop who plays chess on the radio with a policeman in another area. It is not a masterpiece, but has a special place in this genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 10/08.
