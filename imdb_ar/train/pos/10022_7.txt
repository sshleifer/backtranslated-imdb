Arlo Tolbukhin burned seven neighborhoods on a mission in Guatemala in 70. He also announced that he killed 16 other people (used to kill pregnant women, then rake it). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that depicts Aro's character through several interviews with people he has known and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious, analytical work, it is not satisfactory at all. This is a terrifying testimony about how some psychological trauma in childhood can turn a man into a monster. My rate: 7/10
