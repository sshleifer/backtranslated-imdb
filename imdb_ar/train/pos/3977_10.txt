I personally saw this footage of the 1960s and 1970s. It was great to know how the drug movement began and basically became a pop culture and an ultimately relentless force in life. The interviews conducted by the classical rock stars are humorous and humorous. You feel like you are in a secret state and flatter your head at the same time ... because it feels good and familiar. I loved it, all segments of the 60 to the present day. I highly recommend this to all aspects, including rock music, the brawler movement, politics and good history. I checked the box that indicates that this contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what the spoiler might consider or not in that regard, because I discussed what is in all four parts, so I just wanted to be safe.
