There are some wonderful things about this film. Marion Davis can act, given the right property. It's great in comedy roles. William Haines can act, and you can see why he was one of the leading men in the screen. (Until a possible scandal forced him out of work). <br /> <br /> The story is a little trite, but it has been treated so beautifully that you do not notice it. The direction of King Fedor is one of the main reasons for this. the product? The genius boy, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about making movies, and you can see the process as it was in 1928, cameras, collections, directed by unemployed directors and actors. You'll see (briefly) some of the most important stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin does his own role, and seeks to sign it. You can also get a glimpse of Eleanor Burdman, Elinor Glenn, Clare Windsor, King Fedor and many other people who are just names and old photographs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, take the time to capture this movie when you can. It's really a wonderful trip in time.
