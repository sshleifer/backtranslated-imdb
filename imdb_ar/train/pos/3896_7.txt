Some people liked the "aristocrats", others hated it, and often came out in the middle. Eddie Eisard's reactions are unlikely to be too extreme - if you can deal with a transsexual comedian (who says he loves girls) and have vocabulary used, say enough use of the word "f" used by his program will be a long beep if presented on a network TV. Many Izzard fans are so dedicated that they see no flaws in their performance. On the other hand, I thought that this show was sometimes more flattering than the Eskard's closet, but it is also often not funny, and even quite funny. He has a way to link the references from the early routine of the presentation to his routine later. He is not the narrator of the story. He's not a joke maker. He is not a feverish imaginative like Robin Williams. He plays ideas, some work and some - routine with the San Francisco and Alcatraz cable cars, for example - are not quite coming. However, it has a way to move safely across the intermittent routines and expand those that relate. This performance was given 7 and was persuaded to raise it to 8. But 10? Not possible.
