Based on a real mining disaster, this early German talk (with English subtitles) is still one of the most dramatic documentary dramas ever filmed. The "Kameradschaft", which includes many non-professional actors, has a chilling view of the friendship that binds miners, no matter which side of the French / German border they may be. A fatal accident brings out the best in everyone, eliminating the orders of any of their superiors. A fellow of the needy miners will receive help from his companions, even under the threat of a heavy loss, including life. <br /> <br /> This film is reminiscent of the self-sacrifice tournament shown by New York University in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Put aside any formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform know only one reason: saving lives and finding their fellow combatants. - After more than 70 years, "Kameradschaft" still has a strong and immortal message: a needy friend is a friend did.
