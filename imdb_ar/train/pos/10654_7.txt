The Haunting is a film that houses a truly creepy house, and affects well the work and sound works, and seems to believe that everything around them is real and this house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past and found it interesting. There are really scary moments in the film and I like the way ghosts have been shown in the curtains, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's result gave the right atmosphere and the design of sounds was the voice around you. What you wish to happen is something more intense. Jan De Bont got a PG-13 rating and was thought to be a little late. Pultrgiste scared me silly when I saw her several years ago and still exists. Haunting few scenes can be used more than pure terrorism. The end was for me, a little climate. Overall, I enjoyed it. Good acting and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish that scared me more.
