Ah, I liked this movie. I think it was all. He made me laugh out loud dozens of times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I write this from the girl's point of view. I think it's a shame that they only registered 5.2 in the rankings. Many men vote? It was much higher than other romantic comedy. Just because I'm a female I do not enjoy all the elegant clicks, but on the contrary I prefer the other types. Romance comedy tends to be shallow and not as funny as it meant. But as I said, this film was in my opinion. Great script, good linings, good representation. Although Eva's character Longoria Barker mentioned Gabriel's desperate housewives, but what about it? It was awesome. I will keep this film for rainy days, days when I feel weak and need some laughs.
