A child with high ideals trying to change things around him. A boy is forced to become a man because of order. The system conceals the truth, and violates the rights of existence. A boy stands inspired by Martin Luther King and tells the truth. A family disintegrates and fights. Movie you can not hide from it. You see things, hear things, and feel things, that until the day you die you will never hope to have ever happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, boy with him, I'm sorry, balls, boy who will not accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a child has the power, He did not do anything else, he holds this movie to the end, and anyone wants to see how abuse was found back in the 1960s.
