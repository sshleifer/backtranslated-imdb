When I started my interest in films, at the age of eleven, I had a great list of "I Must See" movies and I go to Blockbuster and rented two or three movies over the weekend; some of them were not for all the fans and my mom went nuts. I remember that one of the films on that list was a "chorus line" and I could not get it; so now, the dream has become a reality. <br /> <br /> Of course, I've lost the menu and will do anything to restore it because I think there are some interesting things to watch out there. I mean, take "A Chorus Line", a play turned into a movie. I know it's something we see a lot these days, but at the time it was quite different, it seems; this film has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musical works that made films today, take the opportunity offered by the camera to them for free, to create different scenes and transfer the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on stage as a play and die in the same place as a movie. After the big test by the famous designer Zack (Michael Douglas), Richard Attenborough directs a large number of dancers while trying to get the job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day: the tension of lack of knowledge, the pressures of having to know the numbers, and the silent competition among the dancers? All this happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal lives and their most dangerous experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all wonderful, but they are shorter with time. <br /> <br /> Like a movie I saw recently, "A Prairie Home Companion", a radio program, Atenborough deals here with the problem of continuity. On the stage or behind it, things do and time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not do if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot at this, but it certainly does not look like that; anyway, it's a great work in directing and editing (John Bloom). But at this small stage, what you wonder is what to do with the camera? With just one set up, Ronnie Taylor's cinema finds the way, bringing certain characters closer, smaller and smaller, showing the theater from a different perspective and giving us also a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> At one crucial moment, Douglas tells us the rest: "Before we start getting rid of you, you're all wonderful and I want to hire you all, but I can not." That made me think about the shows of reality today, where the only thing that matters is the singing or dancing talent where the jury always says those exact words to the contestants before they leave (even when they are not good). It's hard, you must imagine; here at least, where all of them are really wonderful. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, characters use songs, and in a second, the stage takes on a new life and is literally "a dream come true." The music of Marvin Hamlisch and the words of Edward Kleban make the theater depict a transition without flaws, which shows the feelings of these dancers and let them do those wonderful designs by Michael Bennett. The book in theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay of Arnold Schulmann; it is sometimes very touching. So if not with a song it would be with a word. But in the "chorus line", it is impossible not to move. <br /> <br /> During a break in the test, Casey, a special dancer played by Allison Reid, takes the stage to convince Douglas that she can do it. The words "Let me dance for you" were never more honest and more beautiful in music and lyrics.
