A thief at night must be the best among all thriller movies. I have no idea what people are complaining about what people feel when they say that these films scared them to accept God. They only needed an excuse and blamed a thief at night. Do not listen! These films not only tell us about the many possibilities of adversity, but also fun to watch them simply. It's actually low-budget and this is a bit obvious, but not quite clear at first sight. I had no idea because I really assumed that many of the films like these that were produced in the 1970s included low budgets all the time. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers. She lives for her own way, until her husband, and almost all of her friends, disappear into the rapture that everyone has warned. At first, the film was not centered around it until it happened. What leads to it is to show that everyone around her has become Christian and believe in Christ, which is what happens to many people. Everyone around them who knew them and loved them will disappear forever, and the person who left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. No one can blame themselves because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Just like those who complain about the film. These adult people must have grown fully. I am 13 years old, and I do not see an ennui, especially since I was just like Patti before Christ was re-admitted into my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything in a Christian movie instead of everyone being stereotyped, they are the wrong movies, which you will enjoy Thief In The Night. Do not knock it before you try it. Something new is always good. Tired of your instincts.
