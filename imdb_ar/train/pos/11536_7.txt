It's hard to watch this movie without thinking about a TV show, it will become this, especially if you love me like me in the TV show more. But there is much to be said for the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matau) is a prominent New York City mathematician living in an eight-room apartment, a victim of divorce and his own personality. Mentally dirty stubbornly. His friend, Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), needs a place to live after his wife brought him out for his stubborn thought. The result is the wreckage of a train and one of the most popular films in Neil Simon's play. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the first: I love this apartment! Poker table, new dart board, oblique pictures of baseball players, empty trays, beer containers, and even a pair of Roman columns. It's a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Jane Sachs are doing a great job opening up the single play group, the Oscar Living Room, by moving to the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the increased tension between Oscar and Felix more angles. <br /> <br /> The result of Neil Hefty's familiarity with the TV show, but not as sweepingly organized as it is here, is heard in many different arrangements that make movement on the screen rise as it is played. The action at the real site and night shots in Manhattan gives the film a common energy for the films filmed in this place and time ("Podwing", "Henry Orient World", "Midnight Cowboys", "Manchurian Candidate", "Rosemary Child" <br /> <br /> Is Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film is supposed to be a more serious relationship, dealing with the middle-aged divorce situation and the frustration inherent in the inability to establish a relationship. Simon has more to think about than getting into Felix and Oscar in the game "Password" or the battle of intelligence with Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were great comedian actors whom I enjoy seeing especially in the middle of this film, as I often do in their separate films, but I never understood why they were a great comedy. Here, in their best partnership, they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemon in the comedy drama and Mato in a farce. Matthau is wonderful at first, and we are fascinated by the behavior of a teddy bear around the poker table, but near the end of the film, it turns out to be much like Torrance's Jack in The Shining, a reaction to Felix who cleans his apartment and offers delicious food to his friends in a way that completely shakes the delicate balance To blame. <br /> <br /> While the end bothers me, the part that many see is the most disturbing, the beginning, works well as I see it. Watching Felix as he stumbles to try to kill himself is not a great comedy, no, but a good way to get into a great comedy, where we feel some real pain before bringing warmth and laughter. (In addition to having some wonderful shots of the most attractive parts of the city.) In the middle of the film, this scene was a misjudgment, but it serves as a way to prove Felix's torment and a great sense of relief when he comes to see Oscar and his friends in poker fighting and wrestling. <br /> <br /> This is where Simon's lines are so wonderful. They are the main force of the film. He gets joking true and real, and still makes it funny. "I do not mind you talking, Felix, you have things to say, what scares me is that I'm starting to listen." The TV show showed how wrong it was to assume that the film was always better. In fact, the TV program had made a good point about "assuming" anything at all, but the film made a solid foundation and was fun in itself.
