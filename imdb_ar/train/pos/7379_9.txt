Here in Brazil it is very rare to watch a good Brazilian film, and the new Brant film is one of this jewel altogether. There are some flaws in the film, of course, but it is very slim. The output and representation in this film is very good! <br /> <br /> You can not wait to see a new movie from Brant!
