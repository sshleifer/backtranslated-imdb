I remember being terrified of the blood of movies when I was younger, gradually getting less tired, and I'm sure a lot of other viewers have become, so that the great series of films I've produced in the past few years has enjoyed me but not scared me or made me Click. "The Dentist" upset this. <br /> <br /> The setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the sides of the mouth, and possibly bodies as well. A clever development, however, is that the dentist is the hero of the film, so instead of being a bad person unilaterally without a clear incentive, his development is the most comprehensive of any personality and is extremely humane and reliable. So the viewer feels sympathy for him as well as his victims. Instead of hoping for justice, I found myself hoping to somehow find a way to cover up his path and return to normalcy. <br /> <br /> What "makes" a horror film really is violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other film I can think of. At first, the film suffers from tons of tension, something that modern films tend to lack. In one scene, the dentist is emotionally disturbed and has to see a small patient for the first time. As he arrives at the child's mouth, she hopes the meeting will end without injury to the dentist and the child. I will not spoil what happens. Second, when the bull comes, it affects all nerves. Again, I will not give anything away. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a movie you have never heard before, it has flaws. Most importantly, it's exclusively for horror lovers. As one of the other reviewers said, by doing more than just a few days, we do not get any background on the characters. Tension decreases slightly during the end. But in fact, the fact that we want to know the background about the characters is proof of how good they are, and that the bulk of the film is strong enough that any small gaps in the tension can be overlooked. <br /> <br /> It is strange, after years of our habit of gore cinema, to suddenly want to cover my eyes in the sight of blood. "Dentist" made me scared and totally uncomfortable, so I got my full approval.
