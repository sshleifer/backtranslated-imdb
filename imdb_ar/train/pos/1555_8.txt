After watching a fairly dirty WW1 spy film, Madame Lilly (1969) starring Julie Andrews on television this afternoon, I suddenly thought I had seen a WW1 spy film superior. All I can remember is that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. Search only took on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. As soon as I realized the title, the memories came back. It is, at the time, a well-crafted story revolving around real events such as Kitchener's death and German attacks in 1918. She also has a more assertive female spy than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, it was the first and strongest memory of the well-produced battle scenes for men and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films, especially World War I, it's a movie worth watching if you have the chance.
