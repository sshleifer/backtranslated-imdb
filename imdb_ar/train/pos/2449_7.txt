When I saw commercials for this I was thinking "nothing happened in NITE DONE!" Because it was taking the "new prince" openings. Well, I still love the new prince. But George Lopez is surprisingly good show. I love how typical Penny does. Carmen is a good figure, it's really funny to see how stupid and emotionally can be at times. I feel bad about the guy who plays a max, and looks younger than him then he really is! But Max is a fun character, and behaves well. And yes, Engie is a bit stereotyped, but she has funny moments. Ha ha George has a big head! Nah but it can be really very good. Funny show! Surely you should often have a home improvement then.
