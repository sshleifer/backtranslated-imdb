He now has a name, identity and some memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but they were still chasing him and destroying the world he had barely built. Now he wants some explanation, and to ride people how to make it what it is. Yes, Jason Bourne, this time, has come back here with revenge. <br /> <br /> Well, this film does not contain the most detailed scenario in the world, but its themes are very clever to ask some serious questions about our community. Of course, like all Hollywood movies since the late 1990s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is the story of superheroes. Jason Bourne is an America captain who looks like a project, and who made a total mistake. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in the second film. He is now fighting against what he considers evil, after the death of a close relative (his girlfriend in the "Supreme") by them. This is all part of the story of the supernatural hero, including a personality (strong but still impressive: invincible) super powers. <br /> <br /> The point of interest is that evil fights all over the world (there are no limits in Bourne's films, personalities move from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), as in the best episodes of "24," an American enemy , Believed to be fighting for the good of his country completely blind to him. Funny how the "Crazy Nationals" are now the enemies of N.1 for Hollywood stories infested with paranoia. <br /> <br /> Along with all these interesting themes, the film is flawless: the female character of Niki Parson is still going on at the moment. It is useless and the direction is not original when it comes to viewer dialogues. But all this does not really matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action film. Motion scenes are fairly impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about Waterloo, Tangier, and everyone else. I particularly enjoyed the fighting in Tangier, which reminds me of the exaggeration and insanity of Tsui Hark's work. The visually innovative viewer, a lot of smart motion parts and a good impact on contemporary American themes: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best film in the series and the flick on the work is very interesting and original.
