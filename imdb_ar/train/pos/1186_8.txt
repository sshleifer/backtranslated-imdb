Much has been said about the "psychological West," but this is one of the very few in this genre. He has great stars in performance, but it is the director who makes this wonderful film. Stewart Granger loses his British safari style to play the retired retired buffalo hunter in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays cocky (unlike the usual cocky young man, Taylor's middle-aged personality too), who wants to slaughter the buffalo, and tempts Granger to work with him. They hire other high-level representatives, Lloyd Nolan and Ross Tamblin, to become supporters. Chasing the murdered buffalo Granger, knowing that they may be the cause of their extinction, and see if they are extinct, the way of life of native Americans will suffer greatly. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is just a realistic saying, unlike the one-dimensional sadie of the modern film, created by obsessed and dog-like. It is insecure and needs human companionship. However, it will not stop at the kill. The end digs Monday against each other, with an astounding conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well illustrated.
