Gregory Beck gives a wonderful performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so) are great and Peck is the absolute joy to watch. The same can not be said for the rest of the film. This is not terrible and I am sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if you are frank) is his vision is Peck. For the rest, you are better off reading the Old Testament.
