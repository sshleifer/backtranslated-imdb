The only notable thing about this film is that it was the first major role for the Steve McQueen Championship. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped, free, but refreshingly honest in this little science fiction film. Steve has shown himself to be the most beloved actor in the automotive industry, who will become an iconic filmmaker after only five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen said he hated the film and that "it was the point." But everyone has to start somewhere, and The Blob is nice, new and innocent. Would we all have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast-paced though expected, but it's still an amusing hour or so. It is really interesting to see Steve McQueen before becoming king of Cole (and Anita Korsot before becoming Andy Taylor's friend). A close friend sent me a DVD for a while, a great addition to my Steve McQueen movie set.
