The striking similarities between the charming fairy Bedknobs of Walt Disney, Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia is very clear. There are more coincidences comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks compared to Mary Poppins although much of the creative talent itself has entered my Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Like The Chronicles of Narnia, it includes some English children who leave London during the raid and are coming to live in the country. These children must deal with the world of magic. But unlike the children of CS Lewis, the children of Rawlins have the magic to conquer their world and help defeat the people who attack them here and now. Do not back down from a fantasy kingdom like the children of Bevensy. <br /> <br /> There is no hard-working philosophy of Walt Disney except perhaps it is not good to beat witches until trainees like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a sorcerer like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury has not become one of the most performing artists in terms of banks without charge. She carries her own magic brand that even Disney's special children could not beat. They won the Oscar for Magic Kingdom in this section for this film. <br /> <br /> Two artists have bid farewell to their films at Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, and has honored many films in the UK as one of the best artists in the music hall. And this great personal representative Reginald Owen as retired general who leads the old guard in the war and in the bidding of the song to the fans of cinema around the world. <br /> <br /> The Robert B. Sherman team and Richard M. Sherman wrote the result for Mary Bubbins one good and serviceable here. The Age Of Not Believe was nominated for the Academy Award, but lost in the attribute of Shaft. Although I personally love honoring David Tomlinson for the most famous streets of London, the Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantastic fantasy film that still stands still after about 40 years. Imagine what it will be like with graphics created by your computer.
