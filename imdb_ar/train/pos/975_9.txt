Also known as Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is an attempt from Miike to a family movie and damn well. The problem is that I can not imagine many parents who want to subject their children to this movie. The best children's movies are those that are scary or have mildly disturbing images, neverending story and back to the mind-boggling Oz, but in the case of Great Yukai War Meek you may take things very far. In fact, I was in the film while presenting the person who repeated the film to the returnees, which he asserted was not appropriate at all. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young hero in the piece that presents himself and explains to him about the problems of his current family. This brief moment of mundane is broken so sharply that the cow gives birth to a human-faced rat screaming that something terrible will come before his death like his abomination (it is quite possible that the creature's hate is some of the strange greetings in Kato). <br /> <br /> After an incredible introduction to the master Padi Kato, and his sister Aji (an amazingly attractive Chiaki Koriami), by raising the dreaded army. The story goes back to normal for a while, but it does not take long before any logic and every little boy is lost with a group of Miyazaki who refuses to take out the evil magician. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is fairly basic and surprisingly surprising at times. It seems that the fully selected film is completely out of place in the film that breaks the cliches on a regular basis, but is supported by a simple inspirational vision of a magical world. It is really a Miyazaki film that has been turned into a direct film, albeit more creative than the usual Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> The movie is just fun to take a look at the colorful and largely practical Yukai designs, while the evil robot brutality with the lack of the best CGI display in the world has a practical and threatening nature which gives them a much clearer threat than you imagine . <br /> <br /> The cast is uniformly excellent, it makes its characters look perfectly natural and it is commendable when you think most of them are in full body structure or rubber suits. Even Agi, full of silly beasts, come as savages and mortals thanks to the amazingly excellent representation of Koriami. <br /> <br /> While the film contains many elements that place it firmly in the family movies area; nice creatures, young heroes, a completely evil villain, a sense of hurt and adventure, and a severe lack of violence. There are elements that make you wonder if Miike should take out such a movie. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a truly terrifying threat element that turns into wild monsters resembling the skinless T-101 skin and with additional saws. These monsters ripped the letters into pieces; the creatures sucked in their bloody mouths, and the children were abducted from their homes by passing them directly from under the noses of their parents before indulging in the killing of few anchors. <br /> <br /> Create a creature equally hard for young minds. Yokai, the protagonists, is fed in a huge oven full of hateful form that spoils Yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess metal blocks. If children think that the burning Anakin was bad, you'll see a man the size of a hedgehog burns to death in a bowl of molten hatred for a minute before turning into a motorcycle. There is also a cut for the parties, in one case, hand-clipped handcuffs in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears one dress designed to serve fans and seems to sleep only with Kato as an incentive, while Princess rivers rivers next to nothing and get The groping thighs of the little protagonist in many scenes), and the public humor that will go directly on the heads of those who have been designed this wonder of technicolor. <br /> <br /> The spoilers are an example that Yokai becomes interested only in the final battle when they think it is a big party. The subsequent battle for the festival is more than anything, complete with beer, surfing the crowds and wandering. And also the scene in which Agi overcame the marigold of a cute furry creature, seems to be designed to attract the accumulated masses of Pokemon Hyperbole. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers At the end of the day, the Great Yukai War became the most powerful of the most recent Miike movies. Although it lacks some perverted magic to say Gozu or Ichi, it only drives the public down to the path of general madness. In fact, this is the most easily disrupted film of Miike, where it embraces the sheer magic of the subject wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching only the Gogo Ass flash.
