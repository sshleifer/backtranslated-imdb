An unbelievably small English film for many reasons. First, it is the rare look of Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance does not rise to the level he would eventually put as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is quite believable as a deceptive lawyer. Historically this film is of great importance because of where and when it was filmed. Being English, did not have a large budget of Hollywood movies of the same age, often appear, but the most interesting is the fact that this film was filmed just before the war and shows England that will soon disappear. When we see today we think about modern ethics and look at the fact that this film and its closest part of the American film "One Night Happened" were in their day as if it were a "fatal instinct" of our time. But after watching this movie and enjoying it for the first time, I can only feel sad when I see it today. With half the film being filmed before 1950, keeping the remaining films means tough choices, and unfortunately such films are often passed to save movies that we all consider important. Color shift, lack of contrast, and poor print quality are often unfortunate. Along with "It Happened One Night", this movie is perfect for enjoying a love game under a blanket on a cold evening and watching a great show, or better yet why not be a double advantage.
