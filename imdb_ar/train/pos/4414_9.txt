Cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I saw this while sailing around Cuba on a cruise in the western Caribbean. These are the details of the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on revolution until the end, when the socialist system came and took over the father's father. The majority of the film is the boy's age and relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can contact. Class A film with good acting and direction. This is a film that tells a story without special effects, big schemes, or real transformations. It is a film about people, their lives, their mistakes and their victories. A good movie worth watching several times a year.
