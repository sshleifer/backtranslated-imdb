I just want to say that I am very happy because someone has hidden the beans in this film. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking. Especially for a student film! I just want to give credit to Spazz for taking some time in vain to take care to find such a rare picture, then comment on it! Most people I know do not have that kind of time, especially since few of them will finish reading it. Glory to you, sir! However, the film follows a high-profile story that is at least unbelievable and ridiculous. I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charles Angels but why hire such an awful actress! Also, what kind of director is acting, writing, producing and editing the picture too! Choose one job and put all your love in that guy! It is shameful because I heard that he made a good film about the deadly toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for dragging the curtain on this movie, people like you would rarely find them.
