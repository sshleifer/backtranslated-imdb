Very good except for the finish which was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The text was very good as it was acting. The pictures were often very attractive, but this added to the film, where the snowy features in good places helped create a mood for the film. This effect has been destroyed by an incredible end. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 8 out of ten, but the end dropped it to 7 points because it looked like it was leaving drastically from the first 75 minutes of the film and it seems very forced to end to make the filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was much better than the much larger-budget films and it seems to have been filmed as a home movie with some additional equipment. Not in the way of much special effects because they were very good.
