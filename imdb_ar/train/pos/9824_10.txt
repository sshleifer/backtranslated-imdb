This flick is a great example of the status of sexy B movies: pornographic movies are bad without hardcore sex. The plot in this one is not too bad as these things go; it involves a lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad behavior, bad attitude, bad-looking woman, bad sets, bad cinemas, bad voices and bad sex scenes. Filmmakers must know the difference between rudeness and eroticism. They do not even have common sense to be Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is that?
