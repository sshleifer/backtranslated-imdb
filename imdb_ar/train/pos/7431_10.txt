I was very entertaining with the film. This was my favorite film in 1976. When I grew up in the 1970s, I was fascinated by the looks and behavior of Chris Christoferson. Of course I'm not a film critic, but for the time I think he was very good. I like a lot of narration from Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked together very well. I've seen the movie several times and still love two of them like Esther and John Norman. I'm very impressed with Chris and see him at a concert when I can. What a talented singer songwriter, not to mention the actor. I've seen him in many films, but I'm still thinking back in the movie "The Born Star".
