I had the privilege of watching Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and touching story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who was sold for prostitution by her family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick looks desperate for her. We are following a difficult journey through Cambodia and hope to reunite. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The film depicts this difficult problem without crossing the line. I moved away from wanting to know more about the issue of trafficking in children and asked how I could help. Everyone should watch this movie because it is a beautiful story and reveals a problem that we no longer have to ignore.
