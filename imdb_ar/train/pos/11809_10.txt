Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic books lovers, because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being just a comic book with bad guys who have a severe disorder of appearance and have fun. Warren Betty directs and stars as the main character who fights crime without even using superpower. I have loved Dick Tracey since I was a kid because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their children. Pacino is similar to Jack Nicholson in Batman and Big Boy Caprice plays with enthusiasm. Madonna as the second villain in this film does not play the same game as the boy she represents. As I said, no blood, obscene, sexually suggestive or anything that offends anyone.
