I thought this film was excellent, because Corrine and Sean were newcomers to the work. She was full of excitement and a little romantic, but there were some points when Corrine did not speak quite clearly (when Sean threatened her with her gun) and her teeth tightened ... maybe she was supposed to do it? I think the role of Joseph and Sony was portrayed very well, and there was a clear contrast. Also, because I saw the next star of the movement, I am sure that Corinne performed his own stunts, which was performed very well. I'm looking forward to another movie by the pair, they're making a great team, or maybe you're still betting on your life - you might make it big in the big apple ', this could be Carmen ... but your life is great!
