I've already enjoyed this show. Even when I was young, I was interested in all sports, including horse racing. It was always difficult to create a series based on race corruption while at the same time obtaining permission from the race tracks to record photography on this controversial subject. One of the episodes I remember especially about a horse is expected to win a big race that looked a little bit. An injection was found in the stable floor, and everyone thought it was anesthetized but nothing appeared in the blood tests. It was too late to realize that the horse was not drugged but the cartilage was removed. Like running a car without oil and grabbing it, the horse collapsed with tragic consequences.
