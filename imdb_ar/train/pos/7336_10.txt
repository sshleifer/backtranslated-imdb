This is another favorite fantasy of Ralph Bakshi. After watching it on YouTube this is. He was appointed in the distant past after the Ice Age, a prehistoric quest for the sword and sorcery between good and evil. Nickon, the god of ice and his mother Juliana Queen, set their sights on the invasion of the known world. When the glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, Larn undertakes to avenge his people and kill the ice lord. At the same time, the non-human disciples of Necron and Juliana take the daughter of King Jarol in Fairkeep Princess Tigra; but she manages to escape, and eventually meet with Larn, who promised to accompany her back to Firekeep; <br /> <br /> This film has a very small library (as did most of Ralph Beckshi's films), but it has become a classic of worship, partly because of the quality of art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazita. I also heard that the script was written by Jerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who shot comedies about the book of Conan, and among the backwriters James Gorny, the photographer of the novels of DinoTopia; although it is true that I have never read Conan or Denotobia. As well as the painter Thomas Kincad, who was famous for his work of sculptures and music boxes for the Bradford Exchange company as well as paintings. Like the films of Bakshi The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, the film has been aired, but the process works better in this film than before. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever, and a wonderful collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of imagination, sexual hint, and erotic adventure.
