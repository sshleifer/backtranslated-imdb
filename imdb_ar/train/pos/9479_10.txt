Tian remake is not good at all. I just click on the re-made documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the 1948 classic film saying a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun's presentation in the Hong Kong Film Archive. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in her silver hair, and her appearance in Hong Kong films is a surprise for her fans. At the Hong Kong Film Festival this year, a special program was dedicated to Fai Mu, the director of this epic film, and still Wei Wei clips of the movie you see everywhere in Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 this year, was surprised that Wei Wei was beautiful at the time.
