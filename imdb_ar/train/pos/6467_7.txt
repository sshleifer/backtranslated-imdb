Two films back that dealt with Indian prisoners of war. Fair Zara and Dewar. Although Fair Zara was a love story for someone who offers everything to someone, Dewar focuses on the same theme. It is not a secret that many Indian prisoners of war have been in Pakistani prisons for years - whom the Indian government has not detained. He has time or empathy and no other side. I'm sure some Pakistani prisoners of war are in India too, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some theater actors such as Yadav Raghubir, Rajendra Gupta and so on. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the lead role, behaved well. Akshay Khana did well. There was nothing Amrita Rao did with some laughter and married songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was even more solid though it was not long. He has acted very well here and the delivery of his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was only a long film for the day the story revolves in all directions (if it's a story) - Deewaar is a good directing film that maintains a good tempo and equates all actors. 7.5 / 10
