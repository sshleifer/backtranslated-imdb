"Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain" were and still are a wonderful classic! They never imagined they were made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and innovative. (Continued to do so in the Chinese ghost story trilogy and subsequent productions). So far it can reach other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is linked to the Zu fighters of the Magic Mountain! "You do not have to watch this movie to understand this plot." The plot is difficult to follow, but frankly does not. "It's all about motion and adventure, and I always wonder what Tsui will do. Hark if he put his hands on the CGI, now we know that he made this film, and maybe sometimes very much but the overall result is nice that I will not be critical in that, there are a lot of events on the screen, you will not believe simply, I think it is a shame This film should not be shown in the theaters here in the Netherlands, because this is Movie scream for the screen time in the movie theaters! This film can easily outperform big-budget Hollywood productions such as "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is lack of humor! Fantasy, martial arts and humor. Somehow, it's missing in this movie. Again I will not be picky these little things. The "Legend of Zu" is on the front of the movement with the most special effects you will see. Classic real!
