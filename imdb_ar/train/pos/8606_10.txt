There seems to be no compromise in this film! Most of them happen in a dream, and like most dreams, they are often stupid and illogical. It is also a wonderful production with some wonderful songs and wonderful performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> The Janet stalemate, the unknown insults and various types of bazu at the Dream Reception are hilarious, and the Jitterbug game with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At some point, she sings a clip of Carmen, followed by the last trio of Faust (holding the shepherd dog, for a strange reason), then "Aloha Oi" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - very entertaining if you can get into the groove.
