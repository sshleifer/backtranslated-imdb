Frownland is like a very embarrassing situation where you end up laughing at the wrong time. Once you realize that you should not laugh, you've already reached the top of the sound; while looking around you at the ghostly white faces with their wide mouths Open and glittering eyes, you feel piercing pain begins in your stomach hole and suddenly rushing in your throat and ... well, you get a point. <br /> <br /> But despite all the frowns and frowns on him, Frownland, he's really a wonderful job, after watching the impersonal chaos of a main character and all his troubles and pitiful tragedies, makes you want to scratch your eyes, and at the time Himself, feels very sorry for him. <br /> <br /> It was easier for me to just get out of Ronald Bronstein's film, but for some crazy reason, I felt a constant determination to continue the process and experience everything that infuriates the film. If you make someone in the fire, you usually want to put it out: Stop! Drop! And roll! But with this movie, you want to watch the torch swallow your body slowly. You bear the pain - perhaps in spite of the hatred, or some unknown masochist curiosity that I can not even begin to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never allow this movie to reach the theater near you. But if you get a chance to catch them, get ready for yourself: bring the dog bag.
