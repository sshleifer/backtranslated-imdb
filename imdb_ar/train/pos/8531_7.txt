Although the plot was sometimes even happier, the VERY finally rumbled, as if the director had run out of his allotted time and needed to hasten the story, but it was generally good for the Made-For-Backwoods-TV cable Type. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter, Marianna Clavino, was very good! I hope to see it more in the cinema. The music was also good, getting all the chill out of dah-DUH-dah-DUH (JAWS) tension. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to watch "while the children sleep" again, but if I do, it will focus on Klaveno's talented performance.
