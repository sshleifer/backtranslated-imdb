Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most depressing comedies in the latest Spanish cinema (take a look at his autobiography), so I did not expect much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... in fact I do not know why the world decided to watch it. Anyway, I just did ... and what a surprise. Gomez Pereira seems to have matured and is now capable of producing a good film. It's the latest work on the middle-aged crisis, disappointing, and seeking a second chance after it was all destroyed. The best half-hour of the film (the most dramatic) is the best part, which makes watching the movie worth watching. As Edward Fernandez played the main role, I keep thinking that he is the best actor of his generation (by far). My rate: 7/10
