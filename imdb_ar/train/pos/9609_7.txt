This was a very good film, I liked it. I thought it was an accurate look at bulimia and how it was not about the diet, but about the pain so deep that they had to find a way to deal with it and choose it. Beth was a meticulously drawn character and in the scene where her mother was confronted with eating disorder, you could see the pain inside her and hear her voice and you know how deep her pain is. I also think that one of the best lines in the film is where Beth yells at the words, "It's not about you." To her mother. These words were very correct and I added a lot to this scene in the film. I think this scene was certainly the most important scene in this film.
