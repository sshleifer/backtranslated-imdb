I write to you nine years after the last episode and I still suffer from the impact that Wildside has made on me. <br /> <br /> It really ended up where many other cop drama went and succeeded. But it took more than that and did not go away from realism on the streets, and often depicted the events of life and characters down to T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series pretty much, instead we got the stupid "Underbelly" that ended His role in acting and acting, creating a full load of American trash - <br /> <br /> Wildside remained faithful to Sydney and that's why I really owe this wonderful series. It was a first-rate acting, and it is a shame to see only a few actors have enhanced their careers while others have gone into obscurity. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of TV history. , So I ask ABC to launch the full series on the DVD, not the first three. Give this string the end you deserve.
