I can not remember many movies where the idiot hero idiots were funny all the time. Leslie Cheung is the antithesis of the hero that he is so thick that he can not be seduced by a great vampire sucker ... I had the good fortune to see him on a big screen and to find a video to watch over and over again. 9/10
