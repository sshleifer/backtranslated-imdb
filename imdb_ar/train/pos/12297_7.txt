Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> On her own terms, this version of Anna Christie of Garbo, filmed a year later in German as a brand new actor, has been reduced and refined enough to work better than English Both are American MGM productions). Garbo is if anything is more commanding (or more beautiful as the presence of the screen) and its behavior is more restrictive. It seems frankly more comfortable, perhaps for many reasons, but we can expect that it no longer envisions its first talk, so it has been amended quickly. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing one movie with others, this Anna Christie is still the same as playing O'Neill with lots of words. His themes about women who want to love without losing their independence are here, but they are carried out in a strange old style anyway. There are some missing scenes - Connie Island section is short and not good - but in general is a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feder (the Belgian-French), simply repeats what has already been done, which I suppose should be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see both movies in a row because they were completely blocked in the same way (not just groups, but shots are all the same). There is a scene removed from the previous film - some of the storm, conceptually, but also a short scene where Marie Dreisler (from the English version) walks with her friend on a board over a drunken channel. . But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no substitute for Dressler, certainly, but for me the German father is more faithful and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Obviously, subjects - migration, lost parents and girls going to prostitution and problems to find true love - have strong currents at the time, especially with European themes (Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman).
