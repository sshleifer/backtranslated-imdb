[Warning: contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend that makes her parents having sex is very uncomfortable. It came to mind when I thought of the public's reaction to "the mother." <br /> <br /> When Mai (Ann Reed) flinched eagerly in bed with her younger lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt that the public was alarmed by the content of nudity or graphic content, as it was uncomfortable to see a woman in her 60s enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette"), "My My Laundrette" proves the "hardcore son" again because he is among the greatest storywriters on both sides of the Atlantic. It is not a movie that you can claim to have enjoyed because it is strange and complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who produced "Notting Hill" ) Make a non-emotional, attractive and effectively activated image of an elderly woman who, after all, is aware of all the pleasures of life. Her son, Bobby, asked her not to be tough, she might turn back, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, certainly. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves Oscar nomination for her role in May. When she watches Mae Darren and Paula (Katharine Bradshaw) in a small bag looking excited in a bar, or when she asks Paula to open the front door after a disastrous history, Reid's eyes reveal Her face is about the pain of May and despair. In the most devastating moments of the film, Mai falls on her knees in front of Darren, ready to do anything for him, and just asks him to be nice. This performance is very brave by a wonderful actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed using Michell for natural sound, especially when May and Toots arrive at Bobby's place. I've made it quite clear that the playing is about May and Tots, the outrageous way that their families welcome. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me, at times, of the honesty and lightness of Mike Lee's work, except for "The Mother" adheres to a simple sense of optimism in keeping you coming. <br /> <br /> My only heart: Decision Michelle gives Mimi and the first love scene Darren a semi-cheesy feeling The lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flaps gently in the breeze, and the only sound is the month of May in the midst of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem is Michelle is that both Reid and Craig, who play the full role of Darren, are making their way to these roles without fear, it is unfair to hide the energy of their primitive characters almost from the public. No worries about subsequent sex scenes. <br /> <br /> This film does not contain very popular characters, we sympathize with May, but it also causes her daughter to suffer, but I suspect that Qureshi was telling people his story with a loved one. I think his goal is to reveal a family that has already started cracking up when something emotionally disastrous happens ... it does not leave it in its frankness and is ultimately memorable.
