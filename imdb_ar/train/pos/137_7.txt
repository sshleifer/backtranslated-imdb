After some negative reviews I heard about in this movie, I was doubtful to give it a boost, but I got Â£ 3.99 in my purse and thought of gambling on a budget like the movie I watched and gave it before & am glad I did, I enjoyed it. From the starring movies such as Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity and Brian Cox I had to bet on it even if it was nonsense but not so, I found some very funny humor especially Alfred Molina Star Spider-Man 2 Character Doc Oak . Excellent was the most fun part of the film. Of course, like so many people who bought this movie, I saw the name Matthew, and that made me get it! It's not very big at all, it's very short at the end of the film, it's not a big part that makes me believe this is why people hate the film. I suggest you give it. Some poor parts need polishing, acting, and more work. But it is distorted.
