Astronaut Steve West (Alex Hadid) and his companions are on a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed immediately, but they seem to be really lucky. Steve returns to the earth a constantly dormant mass of the human heart; as he turns into a savage killer, melted every step of the way, his friend, Dr. Burr DeBenning, follows him. <br /> <br /> This is often very funny - with enough silly lines and positions to do - it's hard to believe that laughter is all unintended. It seems to me that I am a bit of a wimp for the low-budget genre efforts of the 1950s and 1960s, and as such, it's a wonderful movie. This sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We've even dealt with a split screen sequence that does not really add anything, but there's still gas to watch. <br /> <br /> Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for this creative idea; his very kind personality is truly memorable. I think the pace of his moves is few. Some scenes (such as the scenes with the elderly couple) continue for a while, but in the end they deliver strong and steady B-type goods with a degree of dismay. Its climax is particularly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obers' music is full of fun (but it is also surprisingly absurd at some moments), and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really wonderful shots at times, leading me to the brilliant and masked makeup of Rick Baker A very respectable focus for the film, leading to final final solubility. <br /> <br /> Rebar became under heavy make-up for almost the whole film (Sacks also praises because he's been a big success in the film) and does what he has to do well enough DePinging is a silly and silly hero, Ann Sweeney does not feel as hot as his wife, but Meyron Heilie, Michael Aldridge and Lizle Wilson are also in good support. "It is also worth seeing people like Cheryl" Rainbow "Smith (filming naked nudes), Janus Blyth (from Tobe Hoopers'" Eaten Alive "and" The Hills Have Eyes " ), And even director Jonathan Demme in a fraction. <br /> <br /> It's a very enjoyable midnight movie with enough bull, chills and laughter to evaluate it as worth searching for low-level science fiction fans / horror everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
