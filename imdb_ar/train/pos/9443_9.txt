It is a shame that the movie "Delivery" is mainly known as The Rape and the Bangos. Even people who have seen the film can not think of this rape scene. It's not as bad as a rape scene at the heart of fiction. It is certainly not as bad as any rape scene for females in almost any film. People tend to miss the power of the movie that contains the infamous prospect scene. <br /> <br /> Representation, acting, cinematography and soundtracks represent each person's hand to his attractiveness. The backcountry that was filmed in it is pretty and completely contradicted with the dark subject. The main and minor actors make you feel like you are wandering this river directly with them. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from others is the tangible sense of horror it inspires. There are not many movies that can make you feel this crawl. Bottom line: This film is classic. I can not really say much more.
