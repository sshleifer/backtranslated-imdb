... on stage or television or in a book, "Women in Black" is a wonderful ghost story. Other reviewers have already said about all that can be said about this film, but I thought I would add my own little late evaluation as well. The film specifically designed for television is the first deliberately slow film, dating to the main character Arthur while doing his work as a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I can understand why this may not appeal to all tastes. However, for me, I like this kind of British novel like any of the BBC's "Ghost Story of Christmas" for the works of Mr. James the Great. In the second chapter, the ghost story began with the dispatch of Arthur's boss to the provinces by the boss, to arrange the affairs of the deceased client. The third scenario builds tirelessly until its hidden end ... And as a Londoner, I saw the play. I own the book, DVD-R and I have an unbound audio book on my iPod as well. What is certain for me, "Women in Black" in any medium is a ghost story with a few of equals. It's time to release a DVD version of the legitimate area.
