When I saw this as a child, he answered all my questions and dispelled any misgivings or misconceptions I had. It is easy to watch because it is moving, making it unaffected. He has no moral bias or "preacher" aspects, so no one should object to him. It is a wonderful movie that simply gives the facts of the menstrual period in a "reassuring" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
