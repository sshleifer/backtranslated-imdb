Although the Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it is still classically and is just as good as the old games. Games with this restart value are few and far between. Plus, this game has a lot of diversity. There are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can perform, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very difficult, but its lack of challenge does not stay away from the game at all. Once you've overcome them, you'll want to clear your game and start over. As enjoyable as it is the second time, or the third time, or two hundred times. Any owner must own the Nintendo 64, which is a reason in itself for owning the Nintendo 64.
