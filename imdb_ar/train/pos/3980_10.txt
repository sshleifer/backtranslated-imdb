I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a fascinating and revealing picture of the drug epidemic and how drugs were introduced in the media during the late 1960s to the 1970s. Vh1 designed a complete complex picture of life and times during the "drug years". This documentary, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54, shows the development and development of the drug trade, death and new life that is being breathed into American culture. Hippie movement, conservative resistance, and how drugs influenced the arts (music, movies, etc.) include many wonderful interviews and news ticker footage. <br /> <br /> Drug Movies: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Boogie Blow Nights
