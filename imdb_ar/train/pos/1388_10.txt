"Today is over" is an incredible picture. In some respects, it is better than "close encounters of type III." (I prefer independent cheese clicks on big budget shows.) The special effects are cheese, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives excellent performance in this film. Probably one of his best roles in a feature. The musical score is very good. The story is meaningless. But this only makes everything more exciting. Like many of the best works of art, "End Time" is not afraid to be hidden and mysterious. "End Time" may be a low-budget film, but not enough to compare it with "existential" European films in the 1950s and 1960s. (Many of which were independent, low-budget productions).
