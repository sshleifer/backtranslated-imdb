This is one of Samo's early great comedy films. This is not a spoof to enter the Dragon, the main character (Samo) obsessed Bruce Lee and imitates him very well for a man of his size. A narrative story about how his fight continues to cause his loved ones' problem - and then fight. Oh, fighting. Scenes are good, fast-paced and very influential (the white man who plays boxer seems to be really hurt by a Sammo kick). <br /> <br /> The most extreme part of this film was completely unintended. There is a man looking Jim Kelly (one of three experts hired to take out Samo), but he was a Chinese man in a black wig front. Come on, did not they have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I've seen enough "fake Chinese people" eggs in old American movies too. <br /> <br /> This is a fan of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
