I really enjoyed this movie. The representation of the great actors was wonderful, although I found the main child a little rough. But he carried himself very well for being a new talent. Humor is very lofty and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy films. Which. Mr. If you have a short interest period and are familiar with the usual things in Hollywood, you may not want to because they are a bit slower. I picked it up on Blu-ray and say that the image quality is top notch. It's probably one of the best Blu-ray photos I have seen so far. The extras were very cold. They've deleted something, but it's probably a good thing because most of the deleted scenes did not add anything.
