The more compact the drama, the better the film would rival the sister! These small gems were promoted as a comedy once it was released in Sweden, so I'm glad to find that it was not. There are funny pieces on the small town squabbles to enjoy, certainly, but the drama takes center stage, with the story progress. Not just family drama, but also questions about how to respect differences in people's choices of life. <br /> <br /> The great personality is combined with many dramatic and moving dramatic scenes that record points of credibility; they are not just distractions, but they keep everything in place. It just makes me suppose that if Ingmar Bergman had made this (the drama would fit him!), International attention might have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Uzgebe.
