No one really understands the logic behind Italian zombie numbering, but? Quite frankly ?? Why bother? Every single film in the series "Zombi-" offers great fun, bad shock and unexplained trauma, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during filming. This film started out as interesting for Lucio Fulci, who had to more detail about his success in "Zombi 2", but it ended up to be a product typical for Bruno Mattei with more flaws and ideas stolen from previous films. The scenario is hopelessly inefficient and ignores all forms of continuity, every genius idea of ​​the "Night of the Living Dead" by George A. Romero and the "madmen" are shamelessly repeated here and the performances are really miserable and painful to consider. However, this did not bother me for a moment because high-class elegance compensates for everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists completed the "one death" bacterial war virus and prepared it for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the body of the infected terrorist is burned and the ashes of the zombie are burned by the entire population in a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight the highly active and inhuman Zombie, as well as the soldiers in white jackets who have been instructed to kill everything moving in the contaminated area. This film is similar to Ambrose Linzi's "nightmare city". Really bad ... but incredibly amusing with a fast paced action sequence and many creative zombie crazy situations. Undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie sequence in the abandoned hospital was also wonderful. The notorious flying head scene is hardly as terrible as it is made up of characters, and it belongs entirely to this soft and very enjoyable Italian zombie. Recommended for the masses. Do not mind the negative reviews.
