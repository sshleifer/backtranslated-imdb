In 1948 this film was my favorite at all. Betty Grable was so charming that I wanted to become bigger and wear such clothes. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was irresistible as a broken Hungarian officer. Silly and thin because this film may appear at the beginning, when I was eight years old, I seemed to say something important about the relationships between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised when she found it still as well.
