This film, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself, but for his family. I can not begin to tell you how I will be able to tell my little daughter that my father would go to Kansas City to cover Prest Holmes and Kansas City bosses. She thought it was the coolest thing, as did the son of Morris. The dreams of living with the family are what this person is about. I think a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
