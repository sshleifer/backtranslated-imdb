I was very impressed by the "waitress" Shelley Adrian (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from this film. Adrian was a great writer and talented, original and unique artist. I was able to show the tragedies of daily life with a silly joke and a genuine optimistic and humane warm tone. Ally Sheedy steals this film with a wonderful performance as a woman fell to the edge. Reg Rodgers of the male, looks like Good Nelson, just fine. There is also a large veil by Ben Feren. The song can stand at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrian as its optimistic coach: <br /> <br /> "It is a world of suffering, in a sea of ​​pain, /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> you are hit by heavy rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let heartless fall on you, br> <br /> <br /> Do not live without heart at your door, <br /> <br /> Do not live among those who have no heart "
