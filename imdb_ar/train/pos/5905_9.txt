This is a really good movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made a reasonable cinema and this is my favorite film. This film should have won the national award and I had chosen India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than "Shaaws", which will go to the Oscars, from India, this year. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the information about this (and all other Hindi movies) on IMDb does not exist and sometimes is wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this film and was not credited with these pages. The rest of the cast and crew were not mentioned at all. Nominations and nominations for this film are not granted even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for the film. There was not even one sound for the movie "Doji". <br /> <br /> "Doji" is not an Indian film. It is a marathon, thankfully escapes the sequence of the song and dance, not intertwined with the magic and elegant tools. It is a true life story full of rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" which can be translated almost as "two women" is the story of two sisters, Gori and Krishna. It's actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhaf does not enter into many sub plots, and this makes it difficult to take out the film. The film is entirely placed in a remote, non-descriptive village in Maharashtra, rarely venturing the screen away from the home of two companions. There is no aesthetic sunset in this one. <br /> <br /> The movie opens and we learn about the entire house, which is preparing for the Gori wedding. The father of Gori and Krishna was a hard farmer; the house was full and happy; there was nothing he wanted in their simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gori meets her husband in a fatal accident. Gouri's father can not bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong and working member, the house could have collapsed but Gori's mother would bear responsibility. They work when they are able to, but they can not meet the ends. But her life is still easier than Gori. The myths, which people try to forget, make Gory of good luck. Is a pariah of society. <br /> <br /> Gori's mother writes to her brother. Desperate to help accept his proposal. Gouri is transferred to Mumbai where he is forced to work in brothels. Gouri sends home the money she earns and her conditions improve. Gouri gives her life for the life of her family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gouri returns home to attend Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come to see her. They do not allow Krishna near them and do not allow Gory to the guests. She loves Gori but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gori completely and decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and carries Gouri. Her beloved sister begs to return. Krishna promises to stand by her side. Promises that they will face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> Nothing is required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gori goes to Mumbai, but what she does there never tells him? Accurate dialogues tell us what to know. It's just a naked story, deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is responsible cinema. He respects the subject he is dealing with. It is respectful to its audience ?? Do not think they have the mental ability of a four-year-old child. <br /> <br /> First class representation. Great trend ?? Silence moves the story forward in some way, and there can be no words. The script was well studied. <br /> <br /> Everyone who appreciates good cinema must love the Doji.
