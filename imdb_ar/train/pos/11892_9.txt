Pialat depicts people in intense emotional situations, usually with numerous violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, deals with the devastating effects on a husband and son of a woman during her death due to cancer. In A nos amour, the sexual experimentation of a teenage girl leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here we have a fairly pampered young woman who gives up her husband to take on a previous sexy trick. Her motivation is a little cloudy, because Lulu is unable to read or discuss anything more challenging than television shows; on the other hand, he got a gorgeous body (I wonder why Depardieu did not make a mathematician ever to show that fitness - he would be great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. Depardieu plays the role of Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you may want - watching the scene in the bar, stabbing the digestive tract, running away and seeking treatment, and then soon resuming with Nelly. Guy Marshand, with these black coal eyes and a sad look, Nelly's husband plays beautifully; it's a good repeat of the coupling in Coup de foudre.
