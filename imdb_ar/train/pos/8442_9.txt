The movie was excellent, except for some scenes using Esposito. I enjoyed how all the investigators gathered in the series, and concluded from some lines that were never resolved during the series (Thanks to NBC ...) It was great to see Pimpleton and Bayliss together in the most humane, and most essential. Brauger and Sikor did a great job, but as usual they will be ignored. It is painful to see that this was the end of the killing. The memories of the tapes and reruns on CourtTV are not the same as every Friday. But the film did its work and did well, providing a wonderful picture of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed this much.
