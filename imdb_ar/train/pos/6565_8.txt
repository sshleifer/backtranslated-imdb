I know that film snobs crave. But if you're looking for an amazingly fun trip through the B-movie Forest, try Jake Speed. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the fish are small, but the monolithic surface has more location for this. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to enjoy playing his role as a very wicked white slave. The enemy of Crawford, Jake Speed. It adds a dimension to the film that only a supporter like Hurt can offer. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you do not wonder why they treat each other. However, both Crawford and Christopher portray a very enjoyable team. If you can overcome yourself for a moment, you may find yourself acting like a child again in the situations and inherent excitement that you provide. The delicious Karen Cobbins does a wonderful job as a girl in a more troubled plight about the motives of her savior and then torturing her. <br /> <br /> I have not yet found a very interesting film without raising awareness, or getting involved in the film by trying hard. Not every film has to be the latest "Citizen Ken". Trust me, Wells was original. So let's remember that sometimes, movies are dedicated to entertainment. There is no social comment or attempt to influence a political audience. But only for the immense pleasure of surviving and living in a time when our hero lives in a post-celluloid.
