Abu, the thief of Baghdad, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from the evil magician. <br /> <br /> While Europe was on its way to war and important parts of the world were on fire, the Alexander Korda in London unveiled this magnificent luxury fare from the legends of Arabian Nights. Filled with swords and sorcery, the masses in 1940 gave a brief respite from the headlines. It's also a great piece of filmmaking, with good acting and clever text. <br /> <br /> Conrad Ved gets the best bills and deserves him, and the evil wizard Jaffer plays. The face of Saturn with its sharp eyes makes one remember the horrible roles it played with this taste during the silent days. Here is the villain worth watching. As a childish thief, Sabo is completely cast in this third film. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his personality is heroic in deed and motion. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors do a good job. John Justin is as active and sensitive as the uninformed king who must recognize the realities of living the hard way; Sabo gets a great deal of movement (when he does not turn into a dog) but Justin is properly fit when he needs it. Jamil Jun Dubris plays the endangered princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. The huge Rex Ingram, which appeared late in the film, shook things like a reincarnation. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his wonderful voice to achieve a good feature like Storyteller. Miles Malison gets an eccentric role as the childless Sultan of Basra, and he gives up forever on his mechanical game (Malison was also responsible for screenplay and screen dialogue). The elderly Morton Silten depicts the King of the Legend of Charity. Mary Morris, the special theatrical actress later, plays double roles for Jaafar's partner and the silver six silver dancer. <br /> <br /> The film began in Britain, but the war difficulties prompted Korda to move him to southern California, which probably explains the presence of the American Ingram in the cast. The trend of art in vibrant Technicolor is more attractive, especially the architecture of fairy tales in blue, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Sabo Dastagir was born in 1924 , Sabo was working in the stables of Maharaja Mysore when he was discovered by Korda and presented in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, DRUM-1938, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best films and found himself working outside Hollywood when they were finished. After outstanding military service in World War II, he resumed his career in film, but was held indefinitely for years playing ethnic roles in non-distinctive secondary films. BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) was the only exception. His latest film, Walt Disney (TIGER WALKS) (1964) was an improvement, but it is too late. Sabo died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years old.
