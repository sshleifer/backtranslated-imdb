Well, I came from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a hurricane but my imagination tells me "very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! You know exactly how old he was but he did not act like a child (well)! Now about the hurricane - it was not very realistic but it scares you! If you want to have a good time in front of the TV - this is the movie!
