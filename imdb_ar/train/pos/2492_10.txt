This is one of the most extreme shows I have ever seen. It's really refreshing to watch and you're in stitches several times. I think there is a social awareness factor for this, too, which makes it very enjoyable. If these white girls will get the same reaction? Maybe they will, maybe not? The characters do not know boundaries (check my words) and do not exclude anyone from his sense of twisted fun! There are lots of funny graphics. My favorite is Bob Construction One. It's so silly she's a genius. If you like twisted black comedy this is for you. If you want to follow the scenes, "3 non blonde's" may not be another funny British comedy that the BBC shows on TV. It's a funny show, and the characters who unleash the rest of the audience laugh with a funny voice! It would be impossible to keep a straight face to watch crazy characters and audience reactions! This series easily adds to the excellent comedy films produced!
