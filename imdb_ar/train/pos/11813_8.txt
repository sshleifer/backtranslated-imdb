I love it or hate it, it's hard not to find Warren Betty's "Dick Tracy", a 1990 film about the famous Chester Gold band, anything less than classic. Superhero films have been out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become a unique genre. <br /> <br /> Beatty freely uses Gould source material to make full impact, filmed in all six parts of the tape. The basic colors, thus giving this unique and familiar world of happy metamorphic gangs, wives, witches and gatherers with a fertile visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the aesthetics of the powerful visual film are too short to change characters and their acting abilities, which I do not think can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy enjoys his looks and horrible characters, and Betty himself, who plays the hardcore. The detector is incorruptible from the title, is a gallery appropriately and ready to break the bad guys at all costs. <br /> <br /> Unlike the visual effects and the Oscar-winning composition, there is a conspiracy, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, the best-performing nominee in the Academy Award) seeks to eliminate Tr in one well-planned step, but seeks Also to control all criminal acts in the city by uniting all his rival gangs. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Tracy is confusing his relationship with Tess Trueheart (who will have her name), who remains loyal to her and cares about the baby (Charlie Cursmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look for in our hero Who breaks the crime. Tracy's accuracy towards Tess was tested through the tempting progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also Big Boy's main pressure. At the same time that all this is going down, things get hot when a new criminal figure arrives in the city, and both sides are determined to play against the center. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, as my home focuses on the strained and romantic relationships between each thread becomes the center of the material, rather than just focusing on useless work and special effects. Pacheco chews the scene freely in a role that really highlights the rest. <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is one of the best and best-known comic book genre films. I think if Chester Gold is still alive, he will be proud of Warren Betty's war-fighting work. <br /> <br /> 8/10
