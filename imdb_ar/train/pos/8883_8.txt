It seems that the design of the film is Alpha and Omega for some of the key issues in this country (United States). We see relationships everywhere in the university's preparation for the film. It is better to be a student versus a teacher present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male versus. Female, white vs.. Black, the individual versus. the society. But most of all in a direct relationship with all other relationships is the individual versus. Himself. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the director's dual view of showing race relations on campus. Most films usually show the grievances of one side while the other side is suffering. This film showed injustice and suffering to both sides. He did not try to show how true either of them was, although I would say that the heads of the skin were showing more harshly and cruelly (quite clear at the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. Paradoxically, this injustice is what brings the two races together for some time, for some time. Laurence Fishburne performs as well as the outstanding Professor Vibes. He crumbles the idea of ​​favortism of race, and instead shows the parallelism of a lazy and barely burdened and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Ebs, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport presents an excellent picture of a muddled young man with a misplaced fury looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks appeared for the first time in his film and proved that supermodels could work. <br /> <br /> Higher education got its name in college show more than going to the classroom and getting a paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire in showing students interacting with each other, instead of a dry book, as a real education at a university. It is a process of learning life, not a textual process. I think you will find "higher education" is appropriate for important issues in many universities and even in life in general. 10/08
