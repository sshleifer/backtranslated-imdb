I've seen the Running Man several times and I love Steven King and I have all his films, but it's better now until two days ago I did not know this site and did not realize that Paul Michael was Glaser who co-starred in this film himself Paul Michael Glaser who grew up watching it TV show Starsky and Hutch. To me this is a pleasant surprise because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starkski or Hatch was injured. The episode in which Starsky died (Kill Starsky) I almost cried so hard that my father had to get away from the show. What to expect from a 12 year old child. Now, I'm intentionally looking for movies and programs that include Paul or David Sol and anything Stephen King sees I'm there !!!!!!!! Just got to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
