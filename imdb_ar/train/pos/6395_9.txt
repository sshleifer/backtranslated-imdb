For me, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Overcoming racism, struggling through life and proving it is not just a simple "cookie", Carl Prascher is a wonderful figure to play, who puts Cuba in its best form, the best performance in his life. De Niro, the living legend, gives something to the film. He hates his character in the film, but it gives a lot of good representation of the film, and the wonderful performance. The appearance of the beautiful Charles was and as always is a great plus for every film. So if you do not see this movie, I was strongly recommended to those who love courage, greatness that seeks inspiration. You must look at this great drama. My vote is 9/10.
