Well, I must say that this was a hell of a fun movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was very cheese, there were some strange moments when the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, but I was not disappointed. The story was really interesting: the last member of Poison Clan must track down the other five members and find out who uses their skills for evil and who uses them for good. The aim is that during training, the entire clan has been hidden, all of whom have since returned to society disguised and changed their names. The clan has a different fighting style: the frog (preferred), the snake, the scorpion, the orchid, and the middle. The fighting scenes make the actors jump everywhere, thankfully that the camera remains planted and uses a shot wide enough to see all the events clearly. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in the film is that the story tends to draw a little in the first half up until the first battle sequence. But stick to it, you will not be disappointed!
