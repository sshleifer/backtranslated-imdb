Although I am not one of the biggest fans of wire-based martial arts, when the film moves directly from fantasy rather than fighting, I enjoy it a lot, and this film is one of the best films in terms of fantastic planning and crazy flying. Ching Siu Tung has put here a charming experience with great performance and a lot of ethereal beauty. The great tragic Leslie Chung plays the role of a tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with an amazing fox spirit and a foolish volcano. Cheungs's performance is filled with naive but respectable charm, and Wu stands outside the wall as a Taoist monk, displaying some sword and getting a musical number. Perhaps the best thing about it is Joy Wang as the spirit of the fox, and it is really a joy to commit to every gesture and gesture. The film captures elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all mixed together in an amusing package. Ching Siu Tung, who runs and manages the choreography, offers some of the elegant excitement of the metalwork, filling the film with clouds, shades and enchanting colors in the forest colors, giving each scene a wonderful atmosphere. It is also worth noting the complex hairstyles and elegant elegant clothes of female characters, with, if I am not mistaken, the Joy Wang sporty hair that has been done like fox ears sometimes, a wonderful touch. Although the film contains only a little movement and some of the recommended cheese pop songs at times, it represents a wonderful part of the entertainment, with swollen and conspiratorial characters, even an exotic character arc, and a constant supply of visual elegance and a dreamy ambiance Dense. Ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
