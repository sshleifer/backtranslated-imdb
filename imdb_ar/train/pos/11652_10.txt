I came across this film by accident when I included all the films I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on holiday and I am very happy because I included this film. It deals with issues that most filmmakers are ashamed of. My only problem with this film is that it was produced for television, so I could not buy a copy for my girlfriend! <br /> <br /> It's an impressive story about how people who suffer from eating disorders are not necessarily ashamed of everyone and how many people already have a diet. It has come to my attention that although people with SLE can maintain a fairly stable weight, they have far more serious consequences for their health than many people are aware of.
