Yes it is. In fact, it's somewhere in the top 20 movies at all. No. 15, I think. Anyway, I'm usually not one for plots, but I think the plots work better in anime and RPG video games (Final Fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. But this one has everything. Live graphics of planets and stars, script very well written. Although this does not actually fit children, they can still see it, and it does not contain dyed blood, courage and silicone. But I do not think they will understand that.
