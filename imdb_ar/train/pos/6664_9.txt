I do not understand why this movie was beaten here. Geez. He is reckless, he is not polished and he (as I read) is wasted on some. The actors of the film play their characters on "T" (if you've seen Midnight and become a fan of Ben Stiller, then you'll have it). These are misunderstood, good-intentioned people trying to save the city / world with something of grit and determination. The problem is they do not realize their limits until the big showdown is the point! This is the 3-fold film that The Spy Who Shagged Me has shown so far by the same demographic group, probably the same people who feel that the first AP movie fades in comparison to the sequel. I just do not get it. Jokes work on more than one level; if you do not get it, I know the level you are.
