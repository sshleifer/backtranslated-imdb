When I first saw the film in the early 1970s, I felt awe at this film. Visually it was amazing and the events that took place on campus in Europe and the USA made you relate to what Anthony is trying to say visually well in the last 15 minutes of the film: the bombing of "tyrannical" institutions and big business interests. The repeated bombing of a beautiful house in the middle of the desert, the main female character enjoying the natural cold water flow, and the crafting of an airplane in narcotic designs (even bold British Airways did a few years ago) are some of the photos copied by the advertising staff All over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased his fans after the film was released. <br /> <br /> You'll see this movie 30 years later and you're wondering why the movie itself was lost. Today's anti-institution films contain more content - facts, documents, fantastic shows, fantastic scenarios. Anthony seems to be out of date. The genius is defective. Even watching Antonioni's "explosion" today gives you a similar feeling that it is stopped. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" should be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great movie if you were to see it on the wide Panavision screen instead of the TV screens. Visual and audio attraction (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Pink Floyd, et al) is still seductive to the film. The leading husband was not a great actor but they were nice and natural. One of them (Mark Frisht) died in prison in the United States of America, reinforcing the reality of the non-conforming values ​​he embodied in the film. <br /> <br /> Anthony appears to be "synchronous" today. But watch carefully and appreciate the silent voices of ordinary actors - Rod Taylor, D. Spradling, ladies in swimming pool, cops in the air bar. The real voices in return are those who are not committed. Antonioni was close 30 years ago, but his grip on the center can not be questioned until today. He knew what he was doing.
