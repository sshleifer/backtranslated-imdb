Terry Gilliam's brilliant and twisted story of a virus that destroys all but a handful of people all over the earth and forces them to move underground and sends the man back in time to gather information about it. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes 12 monkeys from most science fiction films during travel is that Bruce Willis' character actually deals with the psychological effects of traveling over time, not knowing what the real truth is: where a traveler comes or goes . Also, the film realizes that things that have passed in the past can not be changed and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in which case the virus is released, can not be stopped or changed. As Willis asserts, "He has already happened," while in a mental hospital, the main dilemma the film is watching is not an exaggerated vulgar plot to save the world; instead, it is Willis' inner struggle to survive. It is a new and innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to the carefully written text of Peples and Gilliam's unique dementia. <br /> <br /> Besides, the storytelling of the 12 Monkey is completely linear and instead chooses to distort and discourage the skillful way in which the story is recounted, including a series of different time series: memories of the past, dreams, memories, present, The past, the future, and even a scene from Hitchcock's Vertigo. All of them surround the viewer with his disturbing feelings of madness and infertility. <br /> <br /> In theory, Gilliam Sida is a mysterious and shadowy supporter of Tim Burton in his desperate scene and image. With a cold, wide and submerged cinematic portrayal, Gilliam drowns in a colorless environment and the darkness of his characters. The viewer is often immersed in mysterious white and antiseptic and often helps to contrast the characters of madness. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt steals most of the wise scenes in terms of performance, and fills them with a patent, performance outside the wall, deservedly deserved his Oscar nomination. As we mentioned, Bruce Willis best perform in his career, not return to the heroic clich√© and cardboard hero, and instead depicts Cole as every simple, influential and tragic man. Equally good is Madeleine Stowe as the same scientist as Willis. She carries them, injecting her personality with both strength and ground strength, collapsing under the weight of what she believes to be a "false religion". <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, overwhelming and complex treatment of what could have been a routine film / science fiction makes 12 monkeys a compelling view of the future future scene. It is a rich, thoughtful and complex story as well as Bravera's cast of the cast and her dark cinematic portrayal of her as a masterpiece of madness. In the top ten of its kind at all, the 12 monkeys are a very luxurious scene for a movie full of intelligence. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
