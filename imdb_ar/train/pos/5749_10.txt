I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality for this comment. Also, this comment will be more important to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say, this film bears a similarity in my life so amazing it is truly frightening. The rest of you will never know how accurate this film is about how people who were in such situations behave and interact in their later lives. <br /> <br /> This was not a fantastic work; it had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testimony on the quality of the film's presentation is the fact that, although it was one of the best films I have ever seen, I see my life. The picture on the silver screen was so painful that I would not be able To see her again. <br /> <br /> But I wholeheartedly support all others as an opportunity to indulge in another person's soul to the extent that she has never seen or will ever return. I know that this is a fact, because this is my soul that will observe it.
