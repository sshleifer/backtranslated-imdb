I saw this film again at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival, and out of 14 films I saw there, I will be fourth. The 900+ theater was full and in the end was warmly welcomed. This was the classic Peter Falk if you were a fan of Falk and offered a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the film seemed long and very strange to me. I am surprised that this has not reached a general release. This was much better than the majority of spam received by major studios. It may be too big that he was directed to the baby boom and senior attendance. Many people can relate to situations in this film. This is likely to enjoy reviving kinds of years from now when people look at this film and regard it as a kind of gemstone. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
