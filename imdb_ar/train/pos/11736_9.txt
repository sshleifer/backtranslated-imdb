For those who are not familiar with the Elvira thousands of Cassandra Peterson, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine with a united gravity that receives a breast message. It seems that her great aunt has died and that she needs to be present to read the will. Eager to raise money for Todd's show opened in Las Vegas, and decide to go in the hope of getting lots and lots of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go is Fulwell, Massachusetts. After being forced into the mantra because of her car crash, she discovered that her great aunt left her three things: a house, a dog, and a cookbook. The town's residents have mixed reactions: teenagers like her, women hate her, and men crave her (though they try to remain moral pillars of society). It turns out that her worst problem is her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. The Cookbook seems to be a book of mantra that will make it a more powerful magician. <br /> <br /> The film is very funny, as Peterson uses the nickname "Elfira" and her sex as a joke ("Do not forget, tomorrow we show the head by two orders ... I mean the thing with two heads"). Particularly funny like Edie McClurg like Chastity Pariah, a woman who works hard to keep the town in queues, but ends up with a ridiculous appearance (the picnic scene is the ideal example). Worth a peek (movie, not her tits, of course).
