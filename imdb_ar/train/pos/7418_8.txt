"Shower" is a story about allegiance, and about progress that can not be stopped in the modern world at the expense of traditional and humane ways of life to some extent. A man forced to choose between his successful career in business, his life in the big city, his wife, and his young backward brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern vs. Old China. Public bathrooms with their pools, fighting cricket vs. shopping malls and skyscrapers. Many older men and women are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiaoping said ... although one kills the other. <br /> <br /> A tender, animated, full of funny moments, bitter moments. You will cry sensitive moments and laugh equally. The actors are enormous, especially the person who plays the role of the underdeveloped boy. Yang Chang does a good job, easy, simple, leaves the story flowing on its own. My rate: 8/10
