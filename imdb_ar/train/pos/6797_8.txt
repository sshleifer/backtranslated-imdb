Some bad reviews here for this reason, I understand why but treat him as a serial killer film with a low budget and you may get more of it than others. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked out some way later because I felt dirty and wanted to bathe for so long that there was a degree of success did not it? <br /> <br /> I would say that there is only the correct level of rotten here to get your skin although the representation maybe a bit too uneven. David Hess is just in this brielfy so do not get your hopes even if you love Last House. <br /> <br /> Otherwise - well worth a look.
