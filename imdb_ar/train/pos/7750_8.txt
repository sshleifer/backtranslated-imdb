Barman directed "Any Way to the Wind" where he sang the song "Dios". Chaos controls the logical and common stress of ideas. The story behind this film goes just in any way the wind blows. This can be really refreshing to watch, if you're ready and ready for it. Viewers who say that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right. Who the hell is Windman anyway? However, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful and noisy place and no way this feeling happens. It also embodies absurdity, racism, bureaucracy, addiction and violence that remains undiscovered in a city that looks friendly. The movie is amusing, funny and a bit shallow. The first appearance of the Barman screen will not have as much impact as its first appearance in music. In light of this, some may disappoint. But then again, the "worst case scenario" would be a sub-headline for "any way the wind blows"
