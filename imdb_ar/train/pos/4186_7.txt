I saw this click yesterday and I have to say that it's the best horror film I've ever made in the $ 36,000 I've ever seen in my life (Sorry Stecler) The movie is definitely worth a look if you're a zombie enthusiast. This film fumes spirit and atmosphere. Some shots of zombies are the best at all to capture movies. Crested carcasses with a creepy appearance slowly ashamed of their victims shouting. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Canadian hot women with exciting accents will keep you busy before your head frightens your body from eating. Enjoy this movie from start to finish. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
