I would have given this wonderful series 10 full voices if Claudia Black had not continued it! Their inclusion as a "silly" sponsor has led to a downward spiral in my estimation. It was brought regularly at the same time as the inclusion of Ben Broder to replace the RDA mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were just swinging from the loss of 'Jack' and did not really need that. The series turned into new episodes of "Farscape". <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of Stargate, and when this series was first announced, I had reservations that it might live up to the film, but then watching the first episode I must admit I was hooked. I've always been looking forward to new episodes with great anticipation
