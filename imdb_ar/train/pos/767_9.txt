As a true producer of hip-hop and electronic dance, this is without doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Beat Street, though not "authentic" in some ways like Wild Style, is a guaranteed movie to beat the heart strings of anyone who boasts a city-based music / DJ music culture and an electric club culture. <br /> <br /> Although I will admit that sometimes the dialogue is somewhat cowardly, you can only feel the characters, and in the end "I wish I were there" for the beginnings of the Hip Hop culture in New York City. Early 1980s. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy Nightclub (real-time real-time rival Rock Steed Crow and NYC Breakers) is essential for hip-hop records like any classic album. See some crusher moves in slow motion if possible to estimate the athletic and stylistic experience of the B-boy / B-bot girl. Praise be to Allah for the nation Zulu !!!
