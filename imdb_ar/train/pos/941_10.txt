I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on TV. I was expecting to watch the movie when it was announced and it was more than my expectation to the level of my expectations. I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year. Except for "It's a wonderful life," this version of "A Christmas Carol" is considered one of the best Christmas movies ever produced. George S. Scott is excellent and cast by a wonderful team led by Roger Reese! Scott once again proves that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott enjoys the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and maintain a unique character for himself. How can someone remember both Baton and Scrooge? Scott does it easily. The trend is superb with luxurious collections, fashion and music that give the film a special sense of time, place and age that was filmed. You will simply love this movie and put it in your favorite list to watch the holiday season.
