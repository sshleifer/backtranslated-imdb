I agree with another user here and I must say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I saw this as a child and loved it perfectly! Scenes Scaffolding is wonderful and you can sympathize with this man because he is treated as a pariah. Nice humor and wonderful kung fu this rock movie! If you love kung fu then you love this !!!
