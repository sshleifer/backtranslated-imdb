If you have a dream problem, this movie may be rated low. But you just have to realize that this movie was not made to please everyone, <br /> <br /> Just being humorous. <br /> <br /> For those people, the movie is awesome! It has been running on old science fiction films and radio programs for a long time, and most of the games have been classified in a charming way, where B has classified themselves. Along Spaceballs and Airplane 2 lines, you may need to extend your imagination a little to get jokes, but it's worth it.
