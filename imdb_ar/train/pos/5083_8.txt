In the hands of less important actors such as Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film can become ridiculous and vulgar. But with the arrival of these two experienced people on the road, I found that Silent Fury is a little more exciting and fun. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger claiming that Colbert is already married, and that he was the best man in the wedding, one can feel the existence of a plot against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan, and her lawyers begin to refute the claim of strangers to a previous marriage, they are greeted at every turn with additional evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is already married. Although it is not too hard to tell who is the main "beggar", it is still a lot of fun with the increasing intensity of the story and its speed. All in all, a good mystery film, strong with great performances from key actors and a good supporting team that includes Paul Kelly who is so much underestimated.
