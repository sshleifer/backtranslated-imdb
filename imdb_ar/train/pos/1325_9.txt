I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07, and was absolutely fascinated every 106 minutes. I love documentaries, but I often find them doing about 25 minutes to go. Forbidden Lie $ works despite not losing my interest. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a story about the biography of her Muslim friend killed by her family because of his relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, a few journalists began to broadcast holes in the story, prompting the public to believe it was a scam. The film covers this quickly but initially, and from there we spend most of our time in Norma trying to convince us that her novel is more than a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly wonderful woman to study and conducts endless interviews with Khoury as she searches for the truth. As always in life, it is not easy to find the truth. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent reactions to the abhorrent image of her novels about Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and shows us the facts. Broinowski is not deterred, but places the parts slowly in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist. Of course, what we find there is meaningless and very difficult to follow, and in the end we do not know whether we think norma or not. She is either a fairly transient woman trying to survive, or a wonderful touch. The network of lies, facts and half-truths you see in the film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interview footage, as well as dramas to tell it as a story, and Broinowski uses these dramas to illustrate to us why people like Norma are able to exist: We want to be fooled. We go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe that what is happening on the screen is real. I may have read in too many things, I did not address the question and answer with Brionowski after the film, but that's what I took from him. <br /> <br /> This gorgeous Australian movie, you should receive the international version, and a bunch of prizes if you ask me. Definitely the best movie I've ever seen in AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see that, if you get the chance.
