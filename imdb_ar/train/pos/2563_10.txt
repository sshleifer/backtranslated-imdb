I have seen many comments here about Brando using Southern accent, some of which felt that they were wrong. When this film was produced, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. Jim Crow's laws were in force. Civil rights were in their infancy. Could this be a hidden social comment, a Southern man who loves a woman of another race? In the same way was MASH accurate criticism of the Vietnam War? Are there any ideas? <br /> <br /> Another comment about the appearance of Myoshi Umeki was "cool". Anyone who was in Japan will understand. At least in my experience, the Japanese people were not inclined to show feelings to outsiders. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. The Americans in Japan were totally alien to this culture, and frank attempts to meet women shocked women. One of the features of the Japanese was to smile when they were embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many US soldiers saw as a sign that their progress was welcome. Remember also that at the time it was shown in the film, Japan had just been defeated, and the occupation forces were treated with hesitant acceptance. I think Miyoshi Omeki has made a very credible performance of what he was putting. Her interaction with American actors has brought back many memories of my own experience in the country. I was able to meet two beautiful young women, convinced that I was not a typical American male, taught me their language and culture during my stay in their country.
