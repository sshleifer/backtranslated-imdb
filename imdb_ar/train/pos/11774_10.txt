Is it a good idea to use live animals to display a large shop window? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" the sale of Bugs promotion assistance is over and the store manager (Nelson) moves it to a new section: mummification . Of course, Bugs and Fun objects begin. <br /> <br /> Using almost every department in the store (children's clothing, sports, shoes, fashion, and women's sleepwear - do not ask.), Bugs come in at every turn, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE ". Even when they are trapped within the limits of one of the lifts, the Bugs will make the best use of the situation. <br /> <br /> Jones is top of his pictorial career as always, as with Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the manager - who seems to be the mainstay of Gildersleeves radio - go and ask your parents). <br /> <br /> The word wise advice: when you encounter a woman with a mysterious appearance you want to try on the slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument yet for animal labor laws.
