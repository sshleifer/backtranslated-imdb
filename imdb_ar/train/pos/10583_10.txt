The crash of the stock market in 1929 and the depression that followed the destruction of the American musical theater almost, and in fact this was the last knockout of music. The people behind the curtains were badly injured in the foreground. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the business economy and its personal economy, James Kenny, the director of the theater, comes up with a great idea. You can broadcast relevant entries for movies that are shown in different theaters that emerge overnight from old theaters. Some other competitors compete for the competition. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite film of Busby Berkeley. It gives James Kenny a chance to showcase some of the versatility of a dancer as well as a strong man. In his retirement, Kani said that while he was showing a few of him away from musicals, he was barely bothered by some of his direct dramas. He wished he had done some musical work in his career, and I wish he had. <br /> <br /> Of course, the launch of these Busby Berkeley festivals at the Theater of the Film Palace defies all logic and reason. But they are creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell gets three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon here, Honeymoon Hotel, and by Waterfall, the last two with Robbie Keller boosted the screen team. Ruby sings and sings with Powell in the last two sessions and shares with James Kane in my favorite number from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is a meaningless girl on Friday at the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she is the one who has the real minds in this duo, and he is quick to save him from some of the domestic problems he faces in addition to that play. One of the best screen roles in Blondell. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamor and Anne Summern in the chorus according to each IMDb page. John Garfield was briefly seen at the Shanghai night number. In a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Keeby moves Cagney to the cinema where they feature a Western B movie starring John Wayne. The voice of the Duke is unmistakable. But the strangest thing is that the short section shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh, another assistant at Cagney's Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers were playing a little joke there. I must believe that the video was intentional. <br /> <br /> The Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at its best surreal.
