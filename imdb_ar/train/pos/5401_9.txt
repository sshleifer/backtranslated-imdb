It is a testament to Goha's brilliant ingenuity in filmmaking, where he managed to complete both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year, 1969. It is a testimony to the criminal disregard of the public (as compared to the media) such as the great Akira Kurosawa) , Which both Hitokiri and Juyukin received less than 500 votes between the two. <br /> <br /> Shinto Katsuo is Okada Izu: Crazy Dog Assassin, loyal to the Tocha clan and Takechi coach, played by another powerful type, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tusha clan was part of the alliance of the Emperor's greatest support against Chogunate. The historical background is fairly accurate - with the increasing political turmoil in Japan between the imperialists and Tokugawa and Western pressure to end social and political isolation for 300 years. It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what eventually led to the restoration of Meiji and the abolition of Tokugawa Shogunate, but it is not necessary in any way. The film was made primarily for a Japanese audience so that some things are taken for granted but it flows very well for beginners as well. <br /> <br /> As one would expect from Hideo Gosha in his golden years (in the late 1960s, the visuals were breathtaking, using an external and internal symbol that hid behind the picturesque beauty. <br /> <br /> When talking about the story, Hitokiri is literally and figuratively dominated by the tormented main character of Izu Okada. Like most of the Champra heroes, ISO finds itself in a moral bond, torn between giri ( Commitment) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes some time to realize exactly what the giri is. For the first of the film, Izo tries to promote the very socialism of the social class and the marriage of the daughter of the aristocrat - a great advance for someone coming from the background of a farmer in a rigid social class system in 19th century Japan. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo Is when he realizes what the cost of self-progress, loss of identity, and thus loss of self.At that point, underwent a very symbolic transformation of the famous swordsman in Tocha Klan to the nameless "without name" without the past or future, Torazo the Vagrant. Although not technically unknown and not of the innovative type in the Yojimbo mold, only the loss of the former self and the rejection of the ego, ambition and self-expression is what allows ISO to see things as they really are and redeem the same value. <br /> <br /> Hitokiri (which I will not reveal here) ends with the best way any story can end: positive or negative, with an ironic twist that gives ISO the final laugh, a last ironic remark in the face of death.
