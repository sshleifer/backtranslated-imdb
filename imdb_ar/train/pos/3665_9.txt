they did it. And boy, did they do it fantastically or what! The BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screens on Saturday evening where he belongs! They did so elegantly! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but he is also an experienced writer himself, so he knows what others want. Another power, as described here in this first episode, is Billy Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the doctor's companion gets a story of a reliable return and a strong personality. It's also good to see Autons return - a nice sign to the classic series there. <br /> <br /> Episode 2: "Apocalypse" - At the beginning of this double bill to review the TARDIS strengths, we end up in a story where special effects are everything! They now have the technology to create truly authentic monster environments - no rubber suits of any kind! Also hints at the end of this episode regarding the new doctor's past - it is very interesting to kill all lords in time and make it the only one. <br /> <br /> Episode III: "The Unitiet Dead" - We 've had the future, and now lets it last. The first written episode other than Davis is a small apartment in some places, but was prepared by Charles Dickens of Simon Callow and the sudden development of the plot when the pathetic "Gulf" was revealed yet pitiful ... <br /> Episode Fourth: "Foreigners in London" - the consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, not least the implications of Rose running with it. Also, we have the first cliffhanger. Not the best admitted. The wicked Slitheen is interesting, although they can search for CGI to their advantage. <br /> <br /> Episode 5: "World War III" - The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first. Also, clips from the next episode coming at the end of the current episode are annoying and corrupting people. <br /> <br /> Episode Six: "Dalik" - Yes! We have had the past, the past and the present (the nest), but now we have come to the good things - the return of the archdiocese enemy. Here I think we can complete Christopher Ecclestone - he was wonderful as a doctor, and no longer in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he remembers the time war and his strange nature as he turns to A Dalek himself. <br /> <br /> Episode 7: "The Long Game" - really just a story acting as a prelude to the final series. Saved by Simon Begg as editor of Tasminna and Tamsin Greg in a beautiful veil. The media controls us - this has not happened before, is it ... <br /> <br /> Episode 8: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human passion and heartache for Rose, and the real consequences of what happens when you really fail in history. Complete marks for Billy Piper are here. <br /> <br /> The ninth episode: "The empty child" - I do not find this child very scary. Sorry, but I do not. It's a good episode, but it can still be a better cliffhanger - it's the next time bits that spoil it. John Paroman was presented here as Captain Jack, a stalwart scammer - a good actor who has been around for a while but seems to have just noticed. <br /> <br /> Episode 10: "Doctor Dances" - the second part of this WW2 story - is made very well in terms of the historical context. The optimistic end is nice, although it is a bit confusing perhaps for young viewers when the "mummy" is detected? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but that does not mean it's bad. Nice return to Slitheen and also an interesting personal study about Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - This starts out very silly, with some good humor and making fun fun in the popular TV programs above in Blighty. Things turn into deadly gravity quickly, and the revelation in the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> Theatrical episode: "Parting ways" - Bye Christopher Ecclestone. As a wonderful doctor in many ways, David Tennant has to work in his socks to be as good as him. The renovation scene was finally played beautifully. Oh, and Dylux returned - to the extreme! God bless the CGI, because they will not be able to pull this naturally! <br /> <br /> In general - fantastic! 9/10
