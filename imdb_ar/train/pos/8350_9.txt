As with this film, we follow unreasonable adventures if they are always attractive to two main characters. But while C + J avoids sex for a bold trip to childhood, this pair stands out in Karnat even to the point of exploring homosexuality. Most of the sex they acquire from partners is grudging or unwilling, however, despite their deep demeanor that does not use the PC, everyone smiles smiling. Such as C + G, through all these remain innocent in the heart, the rebels against the Quedians, the bourgeois, the bound. As another person commented, I do not want to know these 2 simple miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what exists from this can not be put on their door) and therefore for this reason, I have been left in a trick but sweet taste the mouth. I dare say that only the French can get movies like this. This is part of their genius.
