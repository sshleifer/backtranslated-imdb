Lisa is the hotel manager or owner and she is on a trip to Miami. She ended up sitting next to a killer named Jackson telling her that she had to change a room from a family or the death of her father. The reason that they have to switch the room is that Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie because Lisa tries several ways to escape this trick created by Jackson. The whole story is wonderful and I think they could spend some time on the plane. There could have been more for the plane but otherwise, the whole movie was good. <br /> <br /> I liked the ending in particular because it stopped working. I did not know what was going to happen and I was surprised. To me, this movie just took off.
