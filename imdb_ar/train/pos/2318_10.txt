I saw this movie when I was a teenager. Rees Witherspoon was pictured by Danny Trent, a 14-year-old female in the Louisiana countryside around 1957. She feels she will not be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (rarely seen Emily Warfield) And the sense of loss in terms of conservative breeding. The 17-year-old Kurt Foster (Jason London), the son of a close friend of her mother (Gail Strickland), moves to face her first crush, while Kurt enjoys her love and deliberate spirit. Danny succeeds in getting his first kiss, but once he sees Maureen, her head is on heels, leaving Danny. The close bond of sisters is severely affected by the competition that breaks out, which only deepens when the court dies in a tragic accident. And then make girls realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just as ideal as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinema and wonderful soundtrack of Elvis Presley, the Ballaters and many more contribute to the film's atmosphere in a simpler time. <br /> <br /> An influential film that extends to the message with an immortal message.
