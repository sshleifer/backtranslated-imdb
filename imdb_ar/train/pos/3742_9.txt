I enjoyed this movie very much, but it is nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here brings him together with other war films, this movie has been rated! It's not a war movie more than "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is an asylum movie or "Cool Hand Lock" is a prison film. This film about individuality, lack of conformity, self-confidence and costs of this kind of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One flew over the Cuckoos Nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", in a good company, they carry their own. In these films, you must resist them and compare them, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
