But the opposite, Bud sorry, I fully understand how you can greek into a movie because you relate to the subject (and you are as well). This movie is terrible, the main character will give any wrestler of Charlie Brown a joy for his money, which always mocks him always laughing, and most of the scenes are embarrassed with characters often more than just stare at someone else. Now, then I will answer it. Best British Comedy? Please my friend, you have a strong word with yourself bad bad ... at the end of the day ... sun sets ... this movie is awful. I mean well done to the people concerned ... they have made a movie ... maybe the motorcycle enthusiasts may have it but people who still live here on earth with a real sense of humor will struggle with this more than smiling at the Christmas gift they nan bought Them ... was that too cruel? I apologize...
