The movie might be great. I've just seen it last night, but I feel unable to give an honest opinion about it because I read the book first. The book is much better than the film so much so that I was disappointed with the film. If you plan to see "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is very good and has more than a love affair with Mildred, and you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I am not making this claim. I read a book every 4 days and read disparate books like Daniel Steele, Oved, Volckner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Humanage" gets my vote as one of the top 10 novels ever written.
