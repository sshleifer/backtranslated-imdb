Richard Dreyfus starred in "Moon Over Parador," a 1988 film by Paul Mazursky, starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfus plays the role of New York actor Jonathan Nolan in the Caribbean country of Baradur to produce a film. When the dictator suddenly dies, the head of the secret police (Julia), who is already in control of the dictator and the country, paints Jonathan to play the role of dictator, noting the similarity between them. Jonathan soon sank into the palace on behalf of Alphonse Simms, a friend of Sims bitch Madonna (Braga) who realized that this key promises to help him in any way possible. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears in the drawing as Sims "Mother, gives us a look at how the CIA works in Third World countries." The character of Winters, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA agent. The film flirts but does not step on a very dangerous ground and it is more than just sending, and funny in it. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfus is doing great work like Jonathan the actor and Alfons the dictator, creating two separate characters and singing each other. Braga's wonderful brilliant like Madonna, and Raul Julia make a funny and evil spectacle like Strausman, the man behind the dictator. Limit those shows where you never know what you're thinking about - you can be nice or transform myself at any moment. Charo is at hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good movie , Not a big movie, but very entertaining.
