I was also looking to find this movie for some time and how wonderful it would be to find it on a DVD ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands. I was very touched by it. It was introduced before the book Jungle Book by Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this film is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was a friend of his eagle. This is very much like. For some reason he was expelled from his village (he did not realize why). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time he turned to Eagle and flew with his eagle friend. The eagle was still wearing a turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
