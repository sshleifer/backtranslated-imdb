Mario Lanza, of course, is "The Great Caruso" in the 1951 film starring Anne Blythe, Dorothy Kirsten, Edward Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly imaginative biography of the world-famous mythical idea known to date. <br /> <br /> The film is brilliantly produced, the music is glorious and beautifully sang by Lanza, Kersten, Judmella Novotna, Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you are a religious person, seeing people on stage smiling with Sextet from Lucia will strike you strangely - even if Caruso Dorothy's wife had given birth to a little girl. Caroso Edgardo is also unlikely to sing in Lucia; the role was too great for him. <br /> <br /> In obtaining a dramatic license, the text excludes some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was very remarkable for him was that he actually created roles in the opera that exist today in the standard set, yet it was never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Liquer and Dick Johnson in the movie "Golden West Girl," and there is a famous picture of him wearing a plate wrapped around him like a tuga. The reason for that picture? His shirt was the only one in the laundry. He was a recorded music pioneer and has a long partnership with Victor Talking-Machine Company (RCA Victor). Jose sang at Carmen in San Francisco on the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> Instead, MGM's story died on stage during Martha's performance, which never happened. He suffered a haemorrhage during "L'Elisir d'amore" in Met and was unable to finish performance; he sang only three times in Met, his last role in Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role in Met was not Radames in Aida, as shown in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when she says on the screen "suggested by the biography of Dorothy Caruso to her husband," that's what it was - suggested. True, Dorothy's father got rid of her after her marriage, leaving her with one dollar of his huge possessions. They also have Gloria's daughter together (he died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's sound is much like Caruso's, but he just listened to Caruso sings in "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is very different from Lanza's. In fact, from his voice, if he wanted, Caruso could have sung Kalbariton. He is believed to have encountered some problems with high notes and additional evidence on baritone tendencies. The role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a key role in the drama, which Lanza certainly did. The sound of Lanza deserves not to be compared with another voice. He has made a unique contribution to the history of cinema and encouraged operatic music. He sings music at The Great Caruso with strong energy; it's really here at the height of what will be a short career. It is natural and real. Ann Blyth is as beautiful as Dorothy and gets to sing her own little. <br /> <br /> Truly a movie for opera lovers and Lanza fans, who may be one and the same.
