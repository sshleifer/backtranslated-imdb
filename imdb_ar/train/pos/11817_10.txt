I saw Dick Tracy when I was too young. I did not know who was any of the actors, and I did not know that the film would turn out the way it was previewed. I certainly loved him. <br /> <br /> Warren Betty played the role of Detective Dick Tracey in the fight against crime in the 1930s, which is chasing the biggest mob leaders in the city. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very strong man and will take control of the city with his girlfriend singer Prithlis Mahoney (Madonna) who took Tracy. It gets worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst is that this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villagers returned from the collection of comic books. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very colorful and imaginative. It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Betty was like James Bond in 1930 the way he played with Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Charlie Cursmo, Glenn Headley, William Forsyth, Dustin Hoffman, James Kan, Ed O'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Dorning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie enjoyed by family. Take my word.
