I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who judged this offer relatively prematurely before publishing any information about it. I decided it would be a cheap offer to guide Ronald Moore, who uses the Rikon stick. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent experience for viewers. Great accessibility! Of course, the veterans of the BSG will find themselves immersed in the plot, which focused on developing the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before pilot events BSG). The pilot also allows newcomers to present their plans and ideas clearly in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not be wrong: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an immersive and brain drama in which provocative, bold and controversial ideas are spread. <br /> <br /> The casting system maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply stunning. Morales 'portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a fascinating glimpse of William's heroic father. Sturtz's image of Dr. Graiston raises a lot of thought and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is no indication of what has not yet come, RDM and the creative team will be appointed to continue the legacy of the first BSG - programming TV programs with another brilliantly crafted television masterpiece.
