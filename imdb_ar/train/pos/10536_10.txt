Yeah ... I'm going with 1-0 on this and here's why. In the past few years, I've watched a lot of comedy movies and left little to no moderate laughter and a few video rental fees because the movies were easy to forget. Then I stumbled upon "nothing". Looks interesting, did not expect much though. I was wrong. This was probably one of the most entertaining movies I had the opportunity to see. Dave and Andrew make a wonderful comic pair, humor was attractive enough to remember, but not so complicated as to lose humor. I do not want to comment on any of the actual scenes, because I feel that this movie is worth watching for once. With the advent of more and more senseless concepts in the movies (you know, like deadly warplanes and "new" reproductions that destroy old classics), this movie will make you happy to say that it's okay to laugh at "nothing."
