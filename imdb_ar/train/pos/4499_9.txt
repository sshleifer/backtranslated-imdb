This story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was more enjoyable to watch on DVD years after PBS was broadcast, with a clearer picture and clearer sound. My only reservation is that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of Manchester's strong dialects are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even if I miss a word here and will not spoil fun: the main actors are ideal actors. Robson Green brings a vague smile, a comfortable temperament, and a mathematical physique to his role as a young surgeon desperate for his boss's wife in the hospital where he has just started work. Francesca Anis is one of the 50 most imaginative women imaginable; her beauty competes. (The scenes of love between these two characters are better than the words as they are important to the age difference for them!) Each of the supporting characters is drawn sharply and photographed well. The combination of pithy and emotional overtones makes this delicious miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be ethically improved by a "reckless" show - but you'll have a lot of fun. (Continuation of the series, part of the DVD set, provides unsatisfactory satisfaction for two hours.) You will not want to miss it if you have enjoyed the above.)
