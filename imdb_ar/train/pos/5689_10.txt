First, this is a review of the disc set associated with DVD rental "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> The two films included with the rent "Wonderland" and the documentary Johnny Wadd, completely enthralled a legend created by Dance Nights. That myth is that the characters involved in the adult film business were far more than the little greed that would do anything for money, basically denying it was anything but self-centered prostitutes. This is strikingly similar to what Wisegey and Goodfellas did in The Godfather and most of the rest of the romantic bands. <br /> <br /> Now, what angered me a lot while watching these movies, and likely to irritate anyone who saw "Boogie Nights" and loved them, is how stupid and naive people can be educated and sophisticated. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who unlike "Dirk Diggler", did not have any quality. Holmes was a criminal criminal meeting that mistreated anyone close to him, was completely consumed by his pursuit of self-gratification, and was undoubtedly a major participant in the brutal murders of Wonderland Street in Los Angeles in 1981. The film highlights the fact that "Boogie Nights" Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic act known as the adult entertainment industry is enhanced. This must be required, both features on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who has any positive views about the story in "Boogie Nights".
