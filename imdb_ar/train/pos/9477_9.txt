This is a film about deep and undeclared human relations. <br /> <br /> In the end you talk, but there is a chance to change anything about the situation. <br /> <br /> It was originally created in Shanghai in 1948 and completely free of publicity and the film offers us to the Dai family. There is still some weight to the surrounding history of the family. History usually has a weight in Chinese literature and serious cinema. <br /> <br /> The young couple - Lian, an invalid, and his wife Yuen live in a large family compound on a day that was partially destroyed. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the bright, young sister of Lian who can not remember the fact of the family past but accepts everything in a natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other book. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world, an unexpected visitor comes ... <br /> <br /> I end up feeling very sad - but definitely a superior movie.
