The Hood of the Dead Dead had a lot to do even before the start of the opening credits. First, any play on "The Living Dead" calls upon His Holiness Mr. Romero and immediately sets a high standard that many films can not aspire to. Second, my film-watching companion announced doubts that any urban horror film would outshine Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptics, we settled in watching. <br /> <br /> We've been rewarded with a surprisingly loyal and heartfelt zombie film. Sure, the budget is low, and of course the directors' friends fill in the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead likes zombie cinema. Inexpensive? Yes. But when this is cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE connects it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and as an alternative mother to his younger brother at night. Dreaming out of Auckland. Before this planned escape, however, his brother is shot to death in a passing car. The strong scientific mind of Reiki offers a superior option to the rate of pulmonary heart resuscitation or 911: injecting the experimental formula of his laboratory. Unfortunately, little bro awakes in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty zombie Auckland! Chaos and Chaos! I think eating your enemies more economical than revenge in a car, but again, I'm poor in the intricacies of urban life. "How is a poor judge?" In response to a majestic scene in which four men were involved, "Oh, white shirts were opened on everyone so that the blood would appear ... I used the same technique in my low-budget horror films." Jordan replied, "No, "The white shirts of the New Orleans bars have been banned for a while." Oh.) <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is set in someone's living room, so there is a great deal of hanging around waiting for the zombie. But the characters are sympathetic and the film is honest - it outweighs its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> The zombie interpretation: When man plays God, the zombie arises! Or, perhaps: Follow the test rules approved by the FDA before human trials! <br /> <br /> Contribution to zombie canon: This is the first zombie movie I have ever seen filming from one car to another. As far as the actual zombie goes, the infection is spread by sting as usual, but the extracellular shots do not work - they kill heart shots. Zombies have pulses, which prove no real death. These zombies make Jaguar's booming sounds wonderful. <br /> <br /> A free zombie movie in a joke: a mercenary named Romero. groan. <br /> <br /> Zombie favorite: Jaguar Little hype zombie brother, of course!
