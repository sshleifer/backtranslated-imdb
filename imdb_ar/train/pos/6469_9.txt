This is a really great short of Hal Roche. This is due to two main reasons: the youngest children in the short term are among the best children ever exposed to the film and the plot has many funny and well written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the younger children The Little Rascals, I honestly can not think of a cute kid from Spanky at about the age of four. Although he was fat and unappealing in later years, he was precious here. The little boy in charge of babysitting, even younger children, was not only funny, but was once again up in this nice field. <br /> <br /> After Spanky's older children have taken to doing the terrifying task of the kids, all sorts of funny chaos breaks. Gags are highly effective and improved at this time - through an unexpected cross-talk involving murder and a final spectacle as Spanky FINALLY controls the small, memorable events. I have not seen these shorts for decades and I am glad I was given this opportunity.
