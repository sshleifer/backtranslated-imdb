Although the deg! It was welcomed as being the closest to what the music industry looks like it is highly fabricated. The director misled the audience to believe that the Johnstonstown massacre had disappeared from the face of the earth after 98. Dandy Warhols and Johnstown were competing. The fact of the subject is not really shown in this film. <br /> <br /> This is said to be a movie that does not quote to infinity, watching an interesting watch where we take a look at two groups of highly talented musicians who design their art. One of the best things offered by this film is a unique perspective between the independent music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for music and two great tapes.
