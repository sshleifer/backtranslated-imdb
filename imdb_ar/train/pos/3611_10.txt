I saw this film after seeing Blue Crush and other Michelle films, I thought it had a bleak future in this work. I was very wrong after watching her performance in the film "Girlfight" I was amazed at the way in which the feelings of one of them embodied a fighter, but also a warrior. In this film, she confronted her father about her treatment with her brother, and the way she carried out anger at injury. The curve of learning their characters in a movie is they can not always put a wall and hide from love, or just because they possess the power they will not win. I think this role was quite appropriate for Michelle, although she did not have previous experience, but the director saw the talent, but I criticized myself for not seeing the talent in it.
