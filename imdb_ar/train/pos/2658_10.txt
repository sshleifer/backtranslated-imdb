Kubrick again presents his amazing ability to craft the perfect ambience for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an innovative degree, creates a terrifying and ominous tone that is present on the entire film and gets the entire spine completely disturbed. It is this impeccable atmosphere that makes The Shining a masterpiece in my mind. Of course it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson offers one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. A scary original image of the mind went mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, cute, but easy to look at when the rest of the movie is so wonderful. In addition to being distinguished by the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
