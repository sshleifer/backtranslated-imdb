This picture was banned from American cinemas in 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamar, (Eva Herman) which caused all kinds of problems among ladies in 1930 but not so much for the male population. This story relates to a young woman named Eva Herman who marries an older man and is charged at the threshold on the wedding night. The husband never completes marriage and does not worry about all kinds of simple things like his shoes and kills insects. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her condition. On a hot summer day, Eva takes a tour of her horse and decides to go swimming naked in a lake in the forest. She runs her horse as she follows him and notices a young man find her clothes and return her to Eva. These two people become very knowledgeable and there is a romantic love story that begins in flowering. There are many more exciting problems that arise during the presentation of this movie to its end. Enjoy a great classic movie Shocker in 1933. Enjoy it.
