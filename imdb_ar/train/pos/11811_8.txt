Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gold. He is a civilian clothes detective who follows a crew of bad guys, from all kinds of original characters such as Flattop and The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These bad guys became so common in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created their own films about bad guys like Tracy in cartoons like Daffy Duck.) Tracy's comics are famous for their liberal use of firearms and modern technological developments (especially wristwatch communication), which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent film. The music was great by Danny Elfman, Madonna's original songs were interesting, but she was not the point of her career. It is strange that when you see the movie and see the disgusting moments, the film is very similar to Batman because of Elfman's unforgettable voice on his lyrics. <br /> <br /> I love the child very speechless, where Pachino acts as a big boy Caprice (and this chin!), Madonna take on the villain, filming and direction impeccable. The film was produced in a highly professional way and includes many great actors who were known as great actors for a short time before the film was produced. (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsyth, Dustin Hoffman, Cathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Kathryn O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Betty himself, who was interesting. It seems as if Betty saw himself as Tracy in a previous life or something because it fits the part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie 8/10 for everything he brought to the cinema that was overlooked (for whatever reason). There was a lot of misunderstanding about rating this film on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were absolutely original and vibrant, as was the style of collections, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not be sorry.
