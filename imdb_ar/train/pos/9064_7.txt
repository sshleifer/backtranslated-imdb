I sat with my children while we watched this movie. We all found it a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, the bully in the fifth grade starts up things with him, which leads to worms. <br /> <br /> A bet has been made and Billy has a lot of time just to eat 10 worms or otherwise. From this point, the bully and his friends try to find bad ways to cook or mute or bake the worms in an attempt to Billy's disease until he loses the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become more and more admired by everyone, even the friends of the bullies. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you whether he will win or not ... You'll just need to see it but I think if you like good family movies, you'll be fascinated by these films. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this film is not just for boys, I have all the girls and they loved it so much.
