Ah, Domino is really refreshing air, something new in the world of cinema. I enjoyed the movie so much because of the complex plot, the diverse characters and the powerful camera effects. I have seen some complaining about the work of the camera, and in fact, according to the creators themselves, the bright and wild shots were the culmination of mistakes made over time. All you see is the desired effect. Some may complain because something like that has never happened before, although that's what sets it apart. On the deeper side, what you see is just how Domino sees things through her eyes, think of it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, I do not see anything very bad about it. Despite their "anarchism" nature, according to some, it is actually just a quick form of storytelling. The plot is not really hard to follow, if you actually concentrate on what's going on. Maybe I'm just because I see films from many different aspects such as acting, plot and so on. I'm not a "translator" or anything that distinguishes films from each other, it's just about me. However, I think this is a really wonderful film, although it is my future as a classic cult object, a great turnout or anything. <br /> <br /> The characters, well, have no doubt how diverse the cast is. I think the cast is excellent because they're all doing a good job of portraying their characters effectively, and that's what makes the film Ladies and Gentlemen. All the characters are very unique plus they will witness a small piece of each of their lives, making them differentiate more. Basically, I personally loved actors and characters. <br /> <br /> Anyone who attacks and burns this movie may not see it as I do or dislike it. It does not matter, it's a wonderful movie in itself, no, it's a great film period.
