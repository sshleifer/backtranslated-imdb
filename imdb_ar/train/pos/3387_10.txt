Truly amazing film, the concept as a vision of a possible prophecy of the future scary. The world is overcrowded, unbearable heat because of the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. In this debilitating nightmare society, Charlton has a great Houston as a poignant investigator for the films Nuerich is trying to discover the truth behind the murder, as opposed to the legend of Noir Edward J. Robinson, who turns into a good final performance. <br /> <br /> One of the pictures that will always be with me from this film is the masses of people filling the stairs and the way that Thorn (Houston) should browse it every time it is used. <br /> <br /> Using a movie for music is also worth noting, although it does not contain points in the usual sense, a good opening theme, and subsequent sections of the music that we are here in the Simonson apartment, in particular Beethoven's cutting in a superb euthanasia clinic Atmosphere.
