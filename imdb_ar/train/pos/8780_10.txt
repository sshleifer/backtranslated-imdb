This is one of the greatest sports films Hollywood has ever made. What a wonderful story about one of the great sporting personalities in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett is particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced a boxing style that continues to this day. In this regard, James J. Corbett is really innovative. But back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, they were like Nicole Kidman. Although it is part of the period, however, the story resists the test of time; did not go old. Bond must be filmed for John Bond. Sullivan is one of the best real-life sportsperson in the history of films, realistic boxing scenes, well planned and very effective. Being associated with a great script makes this movie a must.
