I've only been able to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being about 30 years ago I thought that scary moments would be tame to some extent. The boy was wrong. There are some great moments that sent shivers down the spine. Even the acting was fantastic, Jimmy Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Blaise was fantastic. <br /> <br /> On the downside, it can be fairly slow in the beginning but once it happens it will not stop. Makes all imitation copies, for example a nightmare in Elm Street, a cry that looks very tame. I can not really say that he's the best at Carpenter because I have not seen much of him, and the only one I can remember is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the culmination of this kind of horror.
