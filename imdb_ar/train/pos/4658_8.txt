Speaking of a dream that casts a dream - only two of the finest actors who have appeared anywhere - Peter Ostinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions", a funny comedy also crooked starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ostinov is a former co-inventor of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and a position in a company run by Malden - with the aim of embezzlement. It's not smooth sailing. He attracted the attention of his rival in the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (whom he knows in their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a short time. She can not keep a job and see in the film in a variety of jobs - all this ends with her expulsion. When Newhart advances her, she invites Ustinov to her apartment to get the curry to cover up, but the two decide they are close. Of course, she does not know that Ostinov is a fraudster. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie - you can only love Ostinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ostinov's machinations, his genius, and ways he slips from trouble. But there is a crooked end showing you who really has minds. Do not miss this movie, which was screened in the 1960s in London. You should only hear Maggie Smith "I've been fired."
