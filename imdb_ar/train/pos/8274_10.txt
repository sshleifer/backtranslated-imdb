This movie is excellent I found it very interesting. I thought the legend of Wendigo was fantastic. The acting was also wonderful, in addition to fashion, production, photography, direction and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family is stranded, on vacation in the middle of nowhere after they hit the deer. Then a hunter shows up and is very angry and angry at the fact that one of the deer's antlers is broken. Then he starts chasing the family and strange things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. he deserves it. Glory to cast, crew and directors. Two thumbs up the road!
