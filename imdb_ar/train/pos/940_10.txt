Okay. I am biased. I live near Shrewsbury, England, where this wonderful film was filmed. Still looks the same now. I remember they were filming here very clearly, the fake snow in the streets for days on end. Often, when I walk across Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house, and this movie will remind me. <br /> <br /> Scott C. Scroge is a more realistic character than many other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the usual miser. Scott is big and imposing. A man finds those younger than himself inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and quotations. The book is one of the most cherished works in English. I do not think there are too many cynics who say people are not able to change and recover. This film version portrays all of this beautifully. George S. Scott is an American but he plays the role of the English idiot with great skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you do not see this version, I strongly encourage you to do so. It is usually available for a very small amount of money ... or do you also mean?
