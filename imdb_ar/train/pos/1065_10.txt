Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction series, located in post-apocalyptic Seattle, focusing on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, on the run of her creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe accommodates, (not as much as Baffy says, but nevertheless accommodates) with an interesting and authentic set of characters. Sure, it's not for everyone, but those who give time will find themselves watching one of the most interesting series there. Dark Angel is ignored criminally, and the rating has been reduced, unfortunately after only two strings. This was a great disgrace, because this had the potential to become a great sequel, although 42 of them were just 10 shy of the long science fiction comedy on BBC Red Dwarf. Since Dark Angel is still incomplete, look for it, and if you want more, Fox must make another string.
