This immortal parable is echoed in this film and in my heart. I have waited so many years to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. It is possible that my feelings will not appreciate their strength. So now I welcome myself with pleasure. <br /> <br /> Paul Paul Mooney has long respected and admired me. His now legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the priceless talents of the magnificent LUISE RAINER talents. Oh, how many faces can you speak as you did to her? Some have said it was the result of her silent years, and this may be good, but her speech is eloquent enough when she gives an opportunity. She was awarded the Oscar for her. <br /> <br /> This film is in an epic in classic proportions. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. Rejectionists may go away if they wish, but they will ignore stories that remain with one lifetime. <br /> <br /> Good land enriches one in ways one does not expect. But nothing will come of it with the joy that I have done. But I just hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not just push me to techniques related to the main players' race. These are the expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with perfect perfection. But I dare to get a million new films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such familiarity, strength, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to re-portray this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never get close to the fragrance that still springs from the essence of this novel. Time will not be shortened and progress will not improve because of its greatness.
