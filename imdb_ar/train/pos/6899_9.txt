The wonderful quality of the star Gerard Philippe, who died a young boy, jumps out of the screen in this ingenious and funny comedy, full of fencing with the sword and strangeness. Loopy charming in her 'storytelling, impossible to resist. Sweet romantic comedy with Gina Lollobrigida is very small as the interest of love. One movie will be remembered with great affection.
