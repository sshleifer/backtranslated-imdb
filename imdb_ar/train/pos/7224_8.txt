When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster - reproduced on the DVD cover - displayed a graphical image similar to the Rubik's cube. It's an appropriate picture: originally written for the stage by Ira Levine, who wrote memorable works such as ROSEMARY'S BABY and STEPFORD WIVES. The play was one of the most famous hurricanes on Broadway and translated as Sidney Lumet into the screen very well. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that are difficult to discuss, because doing so in any detail gives the plot that is famous for it. But the opening premise is very clever: Sydney Bruhl (Michael Kane) is a famous author of mystery games, but he seems to have lost a touch these days. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a theatrical text about a play he has written. Called "Deathtrap", Sidney realizes it's a sure blow. Just the kind of strikes that would revive his career ... in fact, a blow to death. When she visits Clifford to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to change in the most unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Like Antly Shaver SLEUTH Twisted Equal, DEATHTRAP is really a story at home on the stage most of the screen. - To access full power, it needs the speed provided by live performance. However, under the guidance of director Sidney Lumette, it displays more respectable on screen. Much of this is due to the staff, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine is a great performer, as Dyan Cannon is funny and beloved as Sydney's relentlessly tense wife, and Christopher Reeve presents what might be the best solo performance of his unfortunate short acting career. If you can not see it in a top-notch production, it will be more than just an act to come. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Amazon
