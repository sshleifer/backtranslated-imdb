The term "Bend It Like Beckham" does not mean much to us Americans who know little about other football, but for English sports fans, it is equivalent to "Bands like Bonds" or "Dunk it like Jordan." A young footballer dreams of bending football around one player and into the net to achieve a goal, just like the star David Beckham, like the little Indian girl, Jess (Barminder Nagra), in Bend It's like Beckham. Jess likes to play football, the kind her traditional mother forbids. However, while playing one day, a passing girlfriend named Gul (Keira Knightley) sees her playing and invites her to try out a girls' soccer team. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Reese Myers), the team is created, something she knows her mother will not agree to. The film is not about parental disobedience, it is about a girl who does what she wants to do, even if it conflicts with culture, not just parents. There is a humor that has been thrown across the film, especially when Joel's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film turns to a vulgar moment, as the big football game is on the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it does not pay off with cheese, but pleasure and light. Football looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in the boy world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, but a girl who tries to find herself and satisfy her parents at the same time, which proves to be rather difficult.
