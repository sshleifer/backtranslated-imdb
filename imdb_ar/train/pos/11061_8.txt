I also experienced a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film depicts the painful reality of the intestines of that experience very well, life out of balance, nothing logical, meaningful relatives, etc ... <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of the most favorite film representatives ever. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried when the story unfolded. Wonderful story and cast. Well done!
