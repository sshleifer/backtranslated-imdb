This may not be an unforgettable classic, but it is a moving love story of an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating professional and life consequences of any unfortunate individual who lacks this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who knows her fellow employee at her factory, a Kaffete mom named Stanley. The iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after losing his job, he is given homework reading in her kitchen. Of course, as you might predict, the two, though initially careful to share, develop feelings for each other. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays the role of Iris, a woman with her own problems, Job lacks opportunities, two teenage children (single pregnant), unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert de Niro is of course wonderful in his portrayal of Stanley's smart and resourceful, but illiterate, which gives dignity to a role that requires respect. They are not a couple of charming young men, as is generally shown in screen romances, but the normal working class, middle-aged husband with beautiful conflicts on earth. <br /> <br /> I will not give the finish away, but it is a beautiful and heart-warming love story and a personal look at the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from a fictional perspective.
