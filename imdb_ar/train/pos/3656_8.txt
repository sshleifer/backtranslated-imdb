If you are having trouble commenting on kufr, this is not for you. Consider: A woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own. Think about it; do not try to locate the mother, who may be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment, and no one from the Italian social services equivalent seems to be making any attempt to put the child into "care" (no social services? Before you know that he is a young man aged ten years or so, and his adoptive mother dies, leaving him the orphanage where a happy man comes out who loves everyone. In nothing, he did not give his bag only to the man who stole it, but organized the local homeless to the inhabitants of Shanti Town in good faith and led them in a battle against capitalism in the form of a businessman who buys the land where Shanti Town stands when oil is discovered there. This requires some swallowing without beginning the subsequent "miracles" with the dead mother of Tutu (the old lady who established him instead of his biological mother) showing him and handing him a pigeon that doubles as a magic wand that allows him to grant modest wishes and finale where the horizons fly away to a better place that supposedly falls Somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film returns here with magic and easy to surrender to. On balance a small masterpiece.
