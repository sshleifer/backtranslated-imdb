I watched this movie every chance I got, and back in the seventies when it appeared on the cable. It was Lee Harlem's introduction, which fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) ever since. I was still very young, and the film made a great impression on me. It was great watching a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to determine who they wanted to be, and taking some bad choices in addition to good choices. I was struck by the beauty of Lunette Mackie, the great clothes they wore in the end, and the sudden dialogue. As a grown-up or a single person, I can sympathize with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem more realistic to me than Beyonce Knowles!
