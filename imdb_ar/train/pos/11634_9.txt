I just came back from a sophisticated show of Redeye and I must say I did not enjoy much in a long film. WES CRAVEN at its best ever. It brings us an amazing end to the summer excitement I craved. This is the thriller of this year ... no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the movement is realistic and fun. The F / X was great. It has built a steady thrill. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been some time since I heard an audience cheer, clap and be excited in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for excitement, movement and a good plot this summer, REDEYE will be offering. Go see it!
