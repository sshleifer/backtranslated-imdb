Youth, sex and the French countryside - one of the most unique films you will ever see. If you can see it, it does not mean thinking about how hard it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It's sometimes exciting, sometimes disgusting, and sometimes funny. Boring trivial also in the middle, but in general you can not label yourself watching a strange movie until you see this movie at least once.
