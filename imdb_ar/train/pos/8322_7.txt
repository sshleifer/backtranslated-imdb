IQ is a nice romantic comedy featuring great actors who seem to be well-liked on screen. The plot is a typical flawed man for the girl, the guy gets the girl's shape, but it makes a solid point that one must love with the heart and not the mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his band of geniuses provide excellent comic comfort. Overall, a good film. Not great, but good
