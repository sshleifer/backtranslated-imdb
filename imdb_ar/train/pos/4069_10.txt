When you listen to soundtracks at the moment, the images come alive to make Shawki a dry eye so powerful (so I can write this). I've seen him twice so far, and I should be ashamed of seeing him * just * twice. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the Miyazaki films and the Gibli Studio, which are always no less than masterpieces (except maybe Nausicaa which was, even in the unpublished version prematurely compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). However, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, where they tend to be more naive / positive (Chihiro), or more clearly, a little clear / moral (Mononoke). At least, compared to the other Gibley Master Takahata (Fireflies Tomb / Just Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this. <br /> <br /> In Mabutaki, Miyazaki recounts all the wonderful stories that fairy tales and stories have collected throughout the ages, along with a little of morale, but are well intertwined with not only a perfectly transcendent atmosphere, but also with humor Entertainment for example Totoro. Each major character is individually photographed with their doubts, concerns, and qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The speed is so perfect that I know nothing but a black hole that will be able to exercise such gravity on your entire being. The story takes place in the form of a film full of puzzles, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating stone, and begins the main subject, you can get a glimpse of the great mystery that is about to be discovered, but the story is settled gradually, through a number of scenes carefully selected from Work and calm beauty, build an unforgettable climax of gloom, hope and beauty - like gloomy days of gloom - finally see the horizon on a clear morning, knowing that the path is delightful, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling just to be able to take a peek at it. <br /> <br /> Much like the exploding white light in your skull, if the time the credits begin to keep your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a treatment. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that some of the more technically modern Miyazakim may be more strange, I have an undisputed masterpiece. If you take part a second to realize that this was done in 1986, you can come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. Of course this has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, explain this simple truth. If you miss this during your life, you will die with a big gap - which would be unfortunate, because the coffin costs itself.
