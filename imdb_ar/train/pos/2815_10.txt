I can not believe my eyes when reading a bunch of other reviews and reviews. As if it were a modest film by some roving men. <br /> <br /> The film is great, funny and crazy, although with minimal persistence, and all the way to the core. I loved every part of it. You can not remember anything crazy like this laughter and the martial arts show off. And now the most important thing (at least for me): It's free computer effects. When I watch some actors in Hollywood playing on the screen in the high-resolution, high-budget fuflo (the Russian word "bull * beep *"), I realize that any child can do that - you can adjust the wires on the body , Add some cute computer effects, and put them into motion film. Here it is different. I do not think there will be even dozens of physically developed motion stars around the world, who can repeat the melee occurring at the end of the movie or the play "Chinese Football". It's just a small cinema in Hong Kong made for fun, not pretend to be Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with English soundtracks is not a problem with this movie. Do not spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> I can not mention the mention of a very elegant play. Some of you, let's say, you will not like it. For me - it's amazing. Take a look at the dragon's friend who is talking crazy with criminals, and suddenly gets a grip on his left side of the head. His expression changes to something whimsical and comes to Dragon with a small expression. Take a look at the size of the threat of his mouth - it is almost authorized to the other when the frown is made. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people from all over the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for launching the classic Jackie Chan movies. His modern actions are much weaker in my humble opinion and not worth much of the hype. <br /> <br /> A total of 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie of its kind. thank you for your interest.
