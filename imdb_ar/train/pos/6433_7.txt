Several posters were quoted by Renoir as expressing a desire to produce a film that shows Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is not all of us, while the harsh reality is that only a few selectees have done so. At this stage of her career she could not arrest Bergman. In 1949 she left Hollywood to shoot a picture in Europe, graduated from Roberto Rosellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy, she may have been willing to open the vein, but during the year, after doing so for Renoir, she returned to where she belonged and with Oscar to boot Anastasia. This is one of three films produced by Renoir in color at about this time, it is better than the Golden Koch, which is not difficult, even with the French it was. Renoir might have reckoned that with much to go, Burjuman could escape two leading wooden men, and Renoir chose Douzouine in Jean-Marie and Mel Ferrer, the solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is satisfied with giving it the light once and focusing on replicating his father's paintings in preparation after the setting. Pastel colors resemble another film from Les Grandes Manouvres, which is not bad. All in all is still a trifle cute presentation of a beautiful and attractive actress.
