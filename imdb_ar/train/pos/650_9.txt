Fantastic movie, rather than really amusing challenge. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotations here, but this is my favorite: Alexander: If you leave someone you love, you have to say what I'm telling you now: "Goodbye, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is illogical. (I did not see it with English translation) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There are many tactics involved in the relations between Alexander and others, yet everyone yearns for more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt more, as Alexander tests. A common explanation is that the film criticizes just "liberated love" by portraying unwanted effects on the people concerned. It does show that in a convincing way, but I appreciate it if the reasons are dealt with in more depth: not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should act on themselves and try to overcome morals Ruling by and not through the practice of liberal love. <br /> <br /> However, the film is realistic and really watched.
