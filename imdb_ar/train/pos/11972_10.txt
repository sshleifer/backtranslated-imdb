I grew up watching a full house as a child. I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started watching it again. Now my children watch the show and they like watching it too. I can not believe my kids that DJ, in the program, I am the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love this show, because it's a show you can watch with your family. Have good teachings that your children can learn from. Also there is no drug and violence on it. Also when children face a problem in the program, they can always open up to their families for help. This is the message that children must connect from TV now days, and go to your family for help, not drugs. Children should watch more shows like Full House instead of Half Chaos on TV now days. <br /> <br /> I also love this program because it makes you laugh while on the ground. Talks about real life problems and family issues. There is always a lesson you can learn from the presentation. <br /> <br /> I vote for the number 10.
