If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed by COMP COMPAT AL. Not only is this rare satirical picture on many of Yankovic's most memorable videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road"), but rather overlapping with the ridiculous short stories that are supposed to highlight Baroudi's height. Jankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and innovative enough that even the fans will be armed at least lightly. Hardcore fans will love her not only in terms of content, but also for her relatively early look at Jankovic's nearly three decades. Suitable for all ages, children will undoubtedly love the fun pictures.
