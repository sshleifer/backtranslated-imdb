I've just been broadcasting this on the BBC and I'm very happy to see it. When the credits rolled over, only the representatives made sure I would. After only five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was an equation and predictable, but somehow added to its charm. The footage of the 1940s was beautifully placed and captured a sense of worth in a few productions. <br /> <br /> A real movie that makes you feel comfortable, with great music. When they are released, I will buy it!
