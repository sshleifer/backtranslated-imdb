A wonderful early musical by Rene Clare, fun and smart like a silent Italian Straw Hat. Using sound in an expressive manner and not only for dialogue and influences, Claire influenced early American musicals (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is heavily influenced by Plumley, for example). If you appear (but will not be displayed) by all the boxes, the DVDs of the Criterion are just as good as you'd expect. There are not a lot of plugins, but most of the DVD extras that I've seen are useless fluff, and Clair's Disc interview is the one I've never seen before. Get it while it still exists.
