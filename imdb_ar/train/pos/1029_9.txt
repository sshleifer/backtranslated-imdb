I would classify the series as the best 10 series in order to develop a story and character distinct and high quality for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of Season 10, "Unending", where Asgard seems to have been killed in a very fast, unconvincing and very unfamiliar way, has left me in a state of disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the very fast end of the series, it is clear that many of the story's arches were originally scheduled to occur during at least one season. I think it soon reinforced these stories to put the Stargate SG-1 franchise for my next direct DVD drive! <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard is returned in a future SG-1 film (with a very good explanation of the "extinct" extinction), I think the fans were cheated in a bad cleaning process for loose ends! <br /> <br /> A bad end to a fantastic science fiction series.
