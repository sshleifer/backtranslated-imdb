In a series full of wonderful rings, this series stands out as one of my favorites. It is not the deepest ring, and there is no meaning or wonderful message. But this is a lot of fun and there are some great shows. <br /> <br /> But what makes it prominent to me is that, to my knowledge, the only * Twilight Zone * Double * Snapper episode ends. The region is well known for its great surprise at the end of the story. But this time, you get a surprise, you think this, but it turns out there is another surprise * waiting. I like this a lot, and this is probably one of my favorite episodes (the second is deeper and more message oriented).
