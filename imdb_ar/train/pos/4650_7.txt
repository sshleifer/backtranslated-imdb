As a Swedish air force officer, I enjoyed the nice Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39, an inverted Rb75 (Maverick) black-coated rocket with the white "EWS 39" along the side. Surely the centuries of real confusion do not look like this, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's an entertaining film with a very amusing ending (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing the various Swedish military units, including the legendary SSG now, on the film must see this one. <br /> <br />
