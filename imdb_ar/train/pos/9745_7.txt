As another person commented, this is a good film. I've got a wonderful scene and the voice of Luciano is full of wonder! I've seen this movie several times and seen it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti singing to Nyson Dorma and I need to eject the CD! It is a wonderful film soon after the afternoon is fun and enjoyable. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a bit of a top, but all agents are like this. The Italian countryside is fantastic but nothing tops the balloon ride for a perfect view. If you need to represent Olivier ratio, this movie is not for you. If you just want a wonderful trip and some great music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
