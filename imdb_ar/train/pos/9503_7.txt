A bit slow and boring, the tale of an old man and his wife living in a shabby building and interacting with steady representatives of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the balcony, the archeological man who smokes the cigars. The photography of the river is gorgeous, as is the interior period decoration. If you love the decoration of Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
