It's easy to make general comments about a film like this. The fact that it is one of the remaining Japanese films of this era makes people say it started "Japanese cinema" and was "unlike anything the West did." The latter of these two comments is particularly false because Kinugasa himself admitted to ripping "Caligari" on more than one occasion. But the style was supposed to be imitated, and does not take away the importance of this film. What we have here is the experimental themes and the installation based on the already visible methods, opening the doors to a truly fascinating layer of stories and facts. For this purpose, the madhouse is the perfect place, and writers know this. This is a historical film, and every effort must be made to trace it. <br /> <br /> 5 of 5 - Basic
