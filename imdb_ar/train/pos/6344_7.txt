I am soaked in the work of Jim Carrey. I keep getting this movie stuck in my head. Grinch admires Martha May, Cindy Loe (too upset; her sweet innocence) trying to get Grinch in the Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (very funny!), Plus the obvious weak end with - Christmas is not all about gifts. I have to say, I felt stupid in coming out of the theater with a bunch of little children and kids laughing and so on, but this film was a very good composition for the short Dr.Seuss and IS for all ages.
