Last night I finished re-watching "Jane Eyre" (1983), a mini-series from the BBC adapted from Charlotte's novel Gothic Romance that merited well-deserved classic English literature with Timothy Dalton (favorite James Bond) and Mr. Edward Rochester and Zila Clark, Jane Eyre, a poor 18-year-old orphan, is a nanny at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield farm. Jane Eyre was one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-year-old girl and a friend gave me the words "This book is amazing" so I've read it dozens of times and I'm still not tired of it. Many directors have drawn their beautiful, refined, fragrant, and surprising language, dialogues, and above all two main characters, and their impossible love story. "Jane Eyre" was adapted on the TV and a large screen several times, 18 according to IMDb. Famous actors such as Joan Fontaine, Orson Welles, William Hurt, Charlotte Ginsburg, George C. Scott and Susanna Yorke, Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton played the couple who overcame hundreds of obstacles imposed by society, laws and religion because of differences in age, backgrounds, experiences and shameful mistakes. for many years. Of all the films I've just seen, a 300-minute BBC version of 1983 follows the story closely, and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays the role of dark characters, does not play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class, Mr. Rochester - sarcastic, vibrant, forceful nature, strong, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was convincing as a sweet, gentle, intelligent, powerful, deeply sensitive, full of emotion, blended with a clear logic and a calm but steady willpower. <br /> <br /> Added on 17 September 2007: During the past two weeks, I have seen five films "Jane Eyre" and it was a great experience. There is something admirable about every modification of Jane Eyre, even if not all of them are quite successful. This version is still my favorite "Jane Eyre" movie.
