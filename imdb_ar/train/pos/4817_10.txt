Young Victoria is a beautiful film Queen Victoria has presented in a different light what everyone thinks about her. The films give the impression that Queen Victoria is "amusing" and show that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> Since I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw the movie was announced, and I was very excited about the promise of days until I reached the cinemas. I was a little worried that he would not be historically accurate, but he was and loved him. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that I had never known and cared about very much. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria has been in many of the spotlight and one of the greatest kings ever, and this film draws her a true picture of how her life was. Her mother's counselor, Sir John Conroy, was treated badly, because he wanted Britain to enjoy the state. This was what inspired Victoria to be a wonderful queen, that was! The romance between her and Albert was very deep, and this was done well by Emily Blunt and Robert Friend, who were wonderful! Young Victoria is a love story I felt loved but at the same time a wonderful look at a large part of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
