I remember this film. Extremely intense for an 11 year old person. Good editing, Bernhard felt terrified. I was watching it again if it was replayed, but the signal goes through Pluto as I write this. Robert Kolb. Highlight his career. I'm glad I did not live in this neighborhood. These seventies. What a contract. If they make it again, I bet it will be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? Excellent movie for pre-suburban boys. It was very intense. I think he was filmed in Los Angeles. Definitely not manufactured in Lodi NJ. The shot with St. Bernard was the best and most obvious picture of the film ... and then they left the sacrifice on the slope. The corrupt children.
