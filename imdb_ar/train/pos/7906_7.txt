Gus Van Sant made some excellent films. I'm really impressed. <br /> <br /> However, I can only feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins' book "Even the Cowboys brought the Blues" was lost in the translation to the big screen. Only Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are visionaries and talent towers. In the end though this one just did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or that the plot and content did not materialize. Our imagination is much stronger when reading a book like this. We move away from a different time and place, sometimes thinking about the worst and / or the best, and adding to the comprehensive roller coaster of the book because it unfolds accurately according to the accuracy of the author. However, films can leave one less than imagination and emotion, detracting from total experience. That's what I think happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
