There is a lot going on in the murders of a college girl. A crazy scientist makes toxic gases that are almost undetectable. Before he can reap the rewards of his discovery, the world is killed by a masked monk. After the death of one of the church's mixed gas victims, Scotland Yard is summoned for investigation, but the killing continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems able to come and go as he pleases inside and outside college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. What you do not like about that killer who sneaks in a red KKK costume with a green look, with red gloves. The white whip that he carries and uses with great efficiency stands out brilliantly against the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a murderer dressed in red flaming clothing sneaking around a school for girls is a fairly elusive idea, it is one of the most sinister fashion I've seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I really want to track the title music of college girls' universities. I felt dizzy, and hip, in my sixties, because I just loved it. <br /> <br /> - Alien touches. Along with the abayas and the murderer's red cover, the film features a sliding heater, a crocodile pit with its hands above the elegance, poisonous spray tumors, casual exhibits, small skirts, long hair boots, and high hairy inclination. I would like to describe it as an intersection between the Batman 60th TV program and Italian Giallo. Killing a college girl is a real treat for the eye. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say that there are more transitions than the mountain road. Only when you think that the killer has been discovered, here comes distortion? .. And another? ?? And another last? <br /> <br /> What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know that the man was aiming to alleviate the comedy, but his quiet character has a lot of screen time. <br /> <br /> - Why the crocodile? Previously, crocodiles were mentioned in the hole. Although it is a nice touch, it serves very little purpose. Why do you go through all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of the murders in the girls' college have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments in the film when things stop inexplicably. It would have been better to make this film a more enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German Germans, but from the few I have seen (Phantom Soho, Strangler of Blackmore Castle, Dead Eyes of London) this may be my favorite. This one has a real funky feeling so I'm really going to. If the plot had flowed better, I could have given the murder of a college girl 7/10.
