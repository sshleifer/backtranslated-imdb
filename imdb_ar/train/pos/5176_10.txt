You should see a movie for anyone who went to the camp or wanted it. This film captures the essence of the summer camp. It's funny, it's a pity that makes you want to see more about the characters as soon as credits start in the role. If you do not see this movie .. what do you do? Get off the butt and run the video shop. Great summer :)
