The 1960s is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good conspiracy. In four consignments, we follow a family of North America, with 3 individuals. But we do not see them only. We are also following the story of many figures as a black saint, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. Photography is unusual. In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam War, between the scenes. The next chapter, does not begin where the last chapter ends, begins after some time, and gives us little mystery about what happened. In general, the 1960s mini-1960s series has to be seen, not only for hippie enthusiasts, but for anyone who has little curiosity about the subject.
