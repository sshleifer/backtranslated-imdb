I did not know about this film if not for his "surprise" nomination for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Luckily, it is possible to be able to watch this tiny mobile treasure. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the child Brendan, who was the nephew of Abbott al-Muhayb and the overbearing in the town of Kells. The most important pre-occupation of Abbot is the construction of a wall to protect the Kells from Viking attacking. One day, the famous photographer of Iona, Eliden, took refuge with them. Eden opens Brendan's eyes on the art of illustration and the temptation of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan became a friend of the White Isle of the White Eagles, where he sought to restore an invaluable old crystal to the art of a careful illustration of the book. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is different from most animations these days. It is a kind of rebound as the illustrations are done in strict geometric lines and design without much attention to realism, as symbolic. The movements of these lines remind us of the simple and optimistic animation style used in the "Kung Fu Panda" sequence. However, the wonderful use of colors is the main source of public admiration. The Reds employed in the Viking invasion sequence are chasing in an unforgettable way. <br /> <br /> Try to pick up this quiet gem from a movie. It is a welcome respite from all the senseless explosives of current mobile fare such as "monsters versus aliens" and the like. The sporadic musical result Celtic is effective in evoking the fantasy feeling that the film drinks. Well, the story may be a little shallow and end a little bit. I wanted to know more about Brendan and Eddin's book. But it is clear that the obvious star of this film is his amazing works of art, which are said to be based on the work of art in a real book by Kells.
