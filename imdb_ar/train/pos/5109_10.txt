I grew up in Houston and was nine years old when this film came out. As a result I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical twist of Johnny Lee's famous song "Lookin 'for Love," which still brings back childhood memories whenever you hear. <br /> <br /> However, a few years before I first saw this movie as an adult and all I can say is, it has exploded. The few films that hit me harder. This movie is as rough and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's farmhouse, the chemical plant in Texas City, the dance hall in Jelly, and the Bode and Sisi. Perhaps for this reason it has no wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about rural music (I'm someone I can not stand up to though my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American Pie. That's why I love it!
