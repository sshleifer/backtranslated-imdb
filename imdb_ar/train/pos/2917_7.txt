Although this film is not classy of any kind, it is very entertaining as I remember it. I saw him about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. Written by the same person who wrote and directed "Arthur", and although not as funny as this film, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon reached with Arthur.
