All Dogs Go To Heaven on equal footing with Watership Down for scary kiddies movies. Both were very dark and evil, but at the same time they were the most fascinating experience of the child. This was one of my favorite films as a child. I was in love with Charlie, and at the age of five or six, I admit ... I stumbled upon an animated dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of the beloved Charlie Charlie and his accomplice in the crime of Aichi. The story begins with Charlie fleeing the death penalty and going to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and animations, but as I grew older, I began to wonder why I was not disturbed by this film when I was young. It deals with adult issues --- gambling, murder, hell and imprisonment, but in a world of good Disney movies, it's something every child should see once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there's a kind of crazy, crocodile scene, and the scenes of hell scare me even more when I'm young, but they offer such a moving message that parents should not ignore!
