I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I could not stop watching until it was over, although I had imagined what would happen. Farrell was wonderful in her role, and everyone did a great job. Some seem to extend from the border, but in general, I loved it !! If you got a chance to see it, please do it! I've already cried in a few scenes, but then I think if you are from your mother. Loretta is beautiful, and I was quite amazed at the idea of ​​being married to mothers there, and it seemed so before her time. I say, see it if possible, do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I totally enjoyed it!
