This film was excellent, I think the original film was quiet and modest. However, these components got all the ingredients, the 1970 HEMI Challenger plant with a 4-speed transmission, which really shows that the Mopar mother knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in the skies of Chrysler every time Kowalski was manipulating Himey, and he certainly did it :)
