Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. Performance worth considering Oscar, again denied by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs a series of silly to give in this wonderful comedy about a man deciding to get out of the big city. The mistakes of building a house have been well documented and have become (loosely) the most recent Tom Hanks car, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you love good old comics without cursing and gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.
