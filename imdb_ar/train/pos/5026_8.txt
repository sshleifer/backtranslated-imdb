It's a great movie that everyone should see. It's like Dean Koontz's book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was impressive because he really seemed to believe what he was saying and doing. <br /> <br /> I do not know why viewers should read in a kind of call to religious murder in the film. It is a fantasy. The end is sudden, but it is imaginary. So what? I think that's what makes this movie good. The spoiler does not read more if you've watched the movie. During the film, the viewer suffers from the constant shock of Paxton's illness, its impact on children, and the way children treat this terrible behavior. Then in the end, it turned out to be true. God placed him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not as introspective as other viewers suggest. He certainly got information he could not have known otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God "protects" Adam through the problem of video quality and the complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not call for Christian murder, it takes the viewer on a very unexpected journey.
