Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> The theme "Mr. Destiny" is recycled from several films spanning many different years. Her theme ranges from a recent parody of such plots (see "Scrooged") to the most serious and dramatic idea she has done in "It's a Wonderful Life", a century ago in the Scrooge story as Charles Dickens narrated in Carol Christmas. "It involves a grateful man who is on a guided tour with his life and attests how his life could be (or was) directly. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of movies, the guardian angel saves a man from dissatisfaction His life shows him retroactively, or how he could have been, so he should have been.In this case, a businessman named Larry (James Peloschi), who hates his life, lives with his non-erotic wife (Linda Hamilton) and yearns for a larger life More meaningful, if he had hit the ball at the state high school championship years ago, he was convinced that his life would be better, I think he remembers this moment that seems r In his life he has had a great influence on his unconscious side, but I suspect that a developing man will yearn for one high school act, yet he works in the film. In any case, Larry leads home From working one night, where he was a cowboy alongside John Levitz, when a car broke down, walked around a bar looking for a pay phone, and reluctantly decided to tell the waiter (Michael Kane) the way he started his life. We saw him recall the baseball strike in his childhood. <br /> <br /> The waiter listens to gestures and does not seem to be concerned about any other clients. This may be due to the fact that the tape, though old and stumbling, seems to have been occupied by no one living except these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about not seeing the tape before. This is probably for some reason the audience expects before Larry. <br /> <br /> So the waiter, who may be an angel of God incarnate, just like Clarence, fixes Larry with his own drink, and ends up bringing Larry back to life, showing him what his life would be like If the house has hit run all those previous years. But Larry had no idea of ​​any change at first, just like Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had spent his life so he went to the bar and drove Larry still unaware of any change until he went home to find you grass outside, and there is a man A large-type wrestler occupies his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon discovered that his life would have been quite different if he had run the house. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved to a large palace with children. He discovers that John Lofitz is no longer his friend but an employee. The most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, Larry always wanted her ... he finds himself lusting after his old wife, Linda Hamilton; proving that the money and the wonderful shallow wife sometimes do not make up everything in a man's life, like a smart wife and love And true happiness. Just like "It's a wonderful life" showed the public that man's life is what he makes, and that everyone has an influence on people, "Mr. Qadr" shows us that material wealth is not the same spiritual wealth, it has taught us repeatedly, but not quite thin It can not be forgotten and truly resolved as it appears to us in "Sayyid al-Qadr". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Al-Qadr" is not our joy at all, but it is a beautiful sweet comedy that does not take itself seriously. The problem with every "wonderful life" being renewed there, like The Family Man, is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It's a wonderful life". But often, you can grab a famous movie on its own, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it, and plays directly into the truth. Do not try to be anything that is not; instead, it's something that did not try to be, and that's obvious to the audience. <br /> <br />
