If you enjoy romantic comedy, you'll find this tale of two 30-year-old singles falling in love during the American Association's flag race. On the other hand, if you are roaming around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you probably have to move away. The plot includes the obligatory man who meets the girl's friends, meets the girl's friends and meets the man with the girl's parents. There is even a man meets the scene of a pet dog girl. This is all equal to the course in a film like this. However, what I liked is that the plot was discussed in the decision-making process of people when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and that it is actually a bit strange. The plot is centered around answering questions; how much is too dodge and how much love needs to outweigh those quirks? It is interesting to see the characters working this way because we are deep down (if we admit it) we have all the quirks. Barrymore is doing very well in her role and I am surprised by Fallon Sorta - it's also good. I rate it 7 out of 10 romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or emotionally involved with one. Add another point if you like Red Sox and put two points up if you love Yankees.
