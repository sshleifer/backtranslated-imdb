This film may not put the Catholic Church in the best light but tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, everything is beautiful and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem right at the right time, but in retrospect they do not look as wonderful as they used to. "Love divider" tells the story of a family, yes it includes religion, but in fact the story revolves around the family, and the ability of that family to stay together no matter what is thrown on them. This film also depends on real events that do not mean that this story, scene after scene, is real, but if you look at the news articles from that period of time, you will see that none of the churches dealt with the incident in a way that was useful to the family. The churches are wrong here, the Catholic Church to impose such an organization on the family in the first place and not to respond to the violence that came with it and the Protestant Church to tell the mother that she must obey her husband and his priests only and not put down fighting. In this case both families fail. I think the film is doing a good job in showing this conflict in both the church and the family. It is by no means a form or form of genocide of the Catholic Church. On the contrary, it illustrates how one incident can change the course of the ideas of that religion and how one person can have more influence on himself.
