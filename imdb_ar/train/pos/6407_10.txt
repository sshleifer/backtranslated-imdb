I went to this film in the cast and the crew showed that my friend, a producer in the film, invited me. Forget what I saw in commercials and forget what I heard, go see this movie yourself. I was more than surprised by it. In the world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, the sixth day, unbreakable, here comes a movie worthy of your dollars, which has barely won glorious scenes, great cinematic and a crew you want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of the most powerful filmmakers this year and with the mind. Robert Deniro deserves the Oscar signal. If you can give Oscar to all the participants as a package, this will be the film.
