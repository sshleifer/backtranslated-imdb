Directed by Brian De Palma and composed by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a memorable film. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American dream. Then Montana becomes a "king" in the drug world where he runs his criminal empire mercilessly in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film contains about 180+ words and is about three hours long. This movie is entertaining and will never get bored. You chant to the drug lord, and in some scenes you discover that Montana is not as evil as some of the other crime masters. This is a masterpiece I recommend to see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
