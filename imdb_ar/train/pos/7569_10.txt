At a time of our culture where the truth unfolds as a fantasy story overcome as we know it on the small and large screen, "apart from that" is a film that reveals moments of real life that feel more truthful, refreshed and creative in the presentation there I've seen before. The usual spice feeding conventions are absent from this movie, leaving the audience to sit and watch these real-life moments fade one by one on the screen. While watching the film, and even when thinking of publishing, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances actually lead to performances. I felt every moment with a large group of actors like the truth exposed in their normal daily lives. However, "apart from that" does not sound like a documentary television or a reality television, but instead turns into a category of his own, with his unique cinematic portrayal and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling with other films directed by Jennifer Scheinin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie should be viewed.
