I watched this movie with my family and it was wonderful! This movie is more than just a documentary film (does not present more than cool facts) with monochrome / long miracle and lots of charts ... The full "power" of this movie comes from impressive images that are filmed underwater, in the air or pole North. While watching this movie, you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, which shows that we are an integral part of the flow of circular life. This film is not only for "environmentalists" although people who want to watch a good movie with a message should watch it. This film taught me that we live not only on earth ... we live with the earth and through it all the plants and animals grow and die with us.
