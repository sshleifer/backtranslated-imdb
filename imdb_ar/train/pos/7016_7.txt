Although I can understand the bad things one has to say about this film, I still find it very impressive. You'll catch it, and unless your critic looks at the depths of all the flaws and accidents of each film, or you simply are not affected by anything, it's worth watching. Do not go into the movie expecting anything, just place a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the representation is wonderful. I think Will Smith, even though he's playing a lonely lonely man again, is amazing. I think the good actor is someone who can really capture the feelings and emotions we all experience in our worst experiences / in a way that makes you feel something. That's exactly what this film is doing. Give her a chance.
