Not many films have been produced around the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) side of the aviation field, but this is one of them which is very good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most films are made in the naval operations of NAS Lakehurst (NAS Tustin plays its part). Wallace Perry plays Ned Trumpet, the beloved chief of staff, who resembles Monchausen, a registered pilot whose long stories have been too frequent and truly unbelievable. Half of the fun is located near the end of the film when events begin to prove that most of his most unusual tales are actually real. <br /> <br /> He was appointed during the Second World War, where the main plot about Single Trombet focuses on a local widow only until eventually the father-son relationship with Jess-Jr. is a widow, Jess. He told me that he would never walk without knives from the doctors, Chief Trumpet pulled some strings and helped the ship's surgeon recover the leg of the paralyzed boy. Jess goes on to join the Navy to become an aviation officer, returning the ball to Lake Hurst and facing a whole new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good, though not so without slipping the Hollywood dialogue after the technical advisers, and Perry's inability to walk in a step. Otherwise, this film gets good grades to ensure its technical accuracy, and gives a rare look at the LTA's marine operations. Cash Cash Scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's love love cath in the future, is an absolute chase.
