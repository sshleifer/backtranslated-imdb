THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This film has been rated highly by Jane Seeskel, but after watching it I can not tell why. The film is original and certainly different. It even has an interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "Noir" feeling. But it is not amusing. As it is not very meaningful, in the plot but especially in personal motives. I do not know anyone who acts like such characters. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film to face - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
