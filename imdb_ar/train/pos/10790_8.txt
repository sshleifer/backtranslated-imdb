This incredible thriller from "Walker, Texas Ranger" contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a television movie. In addition, one can largely predict the outcome of the start. However, it's a fun little movie that does the trick: it's fun. That's all it was supposed to do as he did so. Thrills and stunts are fun and exciting and the plot is not too bad. The acting is also good, which is no surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love this. If not, do not waste your time. 10/08
