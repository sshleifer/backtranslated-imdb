Every now and then, this movie, which has never been heard before, was filmed in a very short time with little money and resources, but everyone goes and finds it a very cool film. This also happened in the fifties of the last century with very few small films that were not heard by many people. There are already some tiny and amazing little jewelry from the 1950s that deserve drilling. "Panic in the Streets" is another such film that springs from the mind. Both movies do not really look like the usual type clicks of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by how much I like this movie. It really was a film that became better and better with its progress. Like all "old" movies, they tend to start slowly, but once you get into the story and characters you're in real fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a truly fascinating story that involves espionage, although the film does not start like that. This thriller begins with a touch of Noir. But "Pickup on South Street" is not just a movie with numbers, so it starts to take its own direction soon. Ensures that the film is still surprising but above all also really updated to watch it. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good men, and all of them are flawed and weak. Really humane. It also features the wonderful performance of Thelma Ritter, who even won the Oscar nomination. It must already be one of the greatest roles women have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Despite its fairly low budget, it's just a great, innovative little movie worth watching before! <br /> <br /> 10/10
