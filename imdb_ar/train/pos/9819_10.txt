It is a wonderful film of the lost age of retro TV drama. My favorite actor all the time, Robert Caleb, skillfully sketches a path through liberal integrity in faith and belief in order, maintaining fear and fear of crime, and deadly psychosis. Adolescents are a collection of pure satirical stereotypes, and the final message of this film makes Dragnet's rings look flat in comparison. But what lights up in this matter is the great speed of the film, the build-up of fear and madness of grandeur in degrees, as well as the feeling of the entire surrounding of California. The cars are really wonderful, as I remember. I give this movie 10 years, I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy it every minute. Remember, just because they are designed for TV does not mean it is not a wonderful art.
