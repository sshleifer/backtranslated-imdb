It's an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a wonderful piece of motion movies in Hong Kong. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macau looking for love and mingling with pimp pimp offers excellent and the characters are all pet and clearly defined. The story involves enough romance, drama, comedy and thrill to keep watching one among the fighting scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best dance designer in the battle. The work is simply amazing, esp. Battle w / Lao Kar Leong and Final. Billy Chao and Samo Hung are amazing. We must see for anyone who loves work.
