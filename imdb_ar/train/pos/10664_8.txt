Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this movie? love it! One of the top 10 films of all time. This just makes me feel good. I watch the final production number with all the team members again and again !!! Baby Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a babe movie, IMHO! I never saw the play, but I was angry when I read reviews that said the play was better than the movie. Two are like apples and oranges. Filmmaking rarely makes a definitive product of the original work. I think because of the fear of alienation the general that many well-known businesses that adapt to the screen do not change more than they are now. It's a very good film, it's very satisfactory. That's all you need to know!
