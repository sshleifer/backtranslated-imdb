- The little spoiler is here! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the sounds of "Creep" today, I was surprised by the many IMDb users who rated this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this kind of movies? Are there many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a horrible movie which is a very good movie! This automatically means: it contains a silly story filled with holes, outrageous risks and simple unilateral characters. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat, then enjoy ... scared to death! The first 60 minutes when there is nothing other than Kate and the lonely subway station are incredibly scary. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen, and will give some jolts just because there is a sudden sound of the flashing neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this film.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her follower, the quality of the film declines but the film is still not bad. The second part of the film is not scary at all, but the effects of injustice were well done and the story is well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching, not a Discovery channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a terrifying hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then leave the cinema or turn off the TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, right? The bad man will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to its end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... If you want to push the anxiety to the next level, do what you did after watching this movie: Leave the cinema dark at night, go to the next metro station, continue the last train home ...
