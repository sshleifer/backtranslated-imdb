I was not a joyous fan of Fawcett ... so far. They were really wonderful in this film. Passion that you must pass by while taking it back after re-taking it is not contemplated. It was a very difficult film to watch, the subject was not very pleasant and you feel completely helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems eternal. I actually felt that the whole thing had diminished somewhat when my friends came home and I found the result at all reasonable. The manager seemed very keen to use the height in his catches and I liked using mirror reflections, and I think he should have paid more attention to speed in the second half of this piece. I'm sure this makes a piece of the theater strong, this film is for me, although it was worth the merit, but it failed.
