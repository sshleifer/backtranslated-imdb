I really listened to this film. All aspects of the film were first class including the most important, for me anyway, script and acting. This is certainly one of the strongest roles of Richard Widmark. He is quite convincing in his performance. Out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum treated this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. I was so impressed here that I would certainly be ready for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unwanted role, deserves the Oscars that she got to play detective. This movie works on every level. Black and white photography is quite appropriate and the story connects the viewer directly from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romantic relationship. Highly recommended, 9/10.
