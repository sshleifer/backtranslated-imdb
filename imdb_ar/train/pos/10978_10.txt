A few years ago, when I saw Gray Gardens for the first time, I remembered laughter and found it joyous. Years later, I still laugh out loud when I see him, but after many scenes, I come to see beauty in the strange and twisted relationship between Edith Boveer Bell, which is inseparable from one another and her little daughter Edith Boveer Bell. The mother and her daughter, who live together in the 28-room East Hampton Palace, add a whole new meaning to the term Shabby Chic. With countless cats and raccoon animals and opossums during their roommate, Jackie's aunt and daughter were allowed. Directed by Albert and David Meisels in their own palace to photograph them living their lives day after day. The result is a funny, beautiful, sad and moving story of true love and chaos. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testimony to the bonds of love that can not be broken. Their lives are an example of leadership, determination and free will. This movie has more to recommend than words. It's a rare experience you should see for yourself. <br /> <br />
