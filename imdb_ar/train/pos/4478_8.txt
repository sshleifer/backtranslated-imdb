In general, this is a wonderful comedy, exhilarating and romantic. I suppose it can make a small tray for a long film. But I'm not sure what you're going to cut. Singing by Kelly and Sinatra? No, the wonderful dance that Kelly does? How long does the film take to develop the story line and develop character relationships? No (this seems to be a common complaint several times that modern films do not develop characters). <br /> <br /> Some comment that Iturbi did not bring much for the film but this gives us a chance to see and hear great talent from the 1040s. What if he is not active? It was an important part of the film, where the basic plot was to get Grayson's test with him. <br /> <br /> Originally Kathryn Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Brought by Louis B. Meyer to MGM to test the screen that included the song. During her audition in the film there is a shot of copper nod and MGM. You can imagine that it was so when she conducted her experience on the real screen years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of life and it is hard to reach all the highlights. Great color and lighting was used throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. One of the good points in the film is how Sinatra (a ladies' man until then) played the role of wanting to find a date during the vacation. You'll feel good watching this movie. 10/07
