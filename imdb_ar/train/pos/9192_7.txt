Let's start this review in a positive way - I'm very happy because they did not decide to come out of Tony and do a season retroactively as some people would. In fact, the creator and writer in this episode David Chase did the opposite. We do not really know whether Tony will live or die. It is in coma and the chances of healing are very slim. This episode seemed to be going very slowly, and the dream of Tony's coma had the wrong identity and the Asian monks who had been slaughtered were quite strange. After 45 minutes, I was a little tired of sadness, but this should not be a reason to flood this episode. The episode was strange and unpredictable, but it was still well written and intense. Eddie Falco has performed an amazing performance that defines her career in this episode, where the opposing wife has to confront her husband. I also found it interesting that AJ came out of school and swore revenge against Junior, and most likely would not have AJ balls that he should pull. Silvio is currently acting as a major actor and opens many doors to problems in subsequent episodes. There was a lot of great pranks in this episode as well, and I think the Spadore of Vito 'Pole-Smoker' may be offset if he continues to be a greedy SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a great episode and was just disappointed because although From that Tony kills people, we adore his audience and feel that he is the champion of the show. This was a necessary episode of the series, although it was a small breakthrough to the end. Glory to the performance of Eddie Falco, David Chase and the book to create this completely original and unexpected plot development. This is the only season of "Soprano" where I have no idea where you'll go. I can not wait for a loop next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best Line of the Episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
