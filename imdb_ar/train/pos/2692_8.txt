I enjoyed watching this movie very much. It has a great direction, by Pegas Luna already known, was born in Spain. In Spain, in particular, the film takes place in Catalonia, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna again explores the subject of absorption, and in this case, there is a small boy for the ladies. milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex felt by the eldest son at the birth of his brother. In the film, this leads to exposing the little boy who suddenly sees that his mother's milk goes to the newly born son. So he starts trying to find a breast that can feed him. He finds it in a woman who arrived recently and from here on, the film revolves around this subject. <br /> <br /> This movie lives a lot on images, more than the story itself, the dissident picks up certain moments (memorable moments) and some symbols (the film deserves a comprehensive analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The ocean, the landscape, the typical of the region, as well as the surrealistic behaviors of the characters, are also symbolic, and the mysterious soundtrack written by Nicola Biovanni takes us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but intersects with time ... Watch this movie, although we may end up tired of moments of illness and feel very tired of excessive overtones, which may be overridden ... <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
