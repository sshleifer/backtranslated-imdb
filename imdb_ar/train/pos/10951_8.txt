Big S does not play with taboo or force an agenda like, Mencia or Chapelle (although I love them both). She said what is clearly hidden, near the camouflaged notes. Its program will not change the world, and that does not mean that. But, along with her former boyfriend Brian Bosen and former friend Bajit Brewster Jay Johnston in fame "Mister Shaw", this one show with appetite for destruction! My side has crashed completely through the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famous friend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and allows the viewer to deal with them. The best kind of comedy around. Faking anything and anyone, such as "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sings to fake birds for a quick comment on community and existential nonsense at university age. This type is highly recommended, but only for those who still have funny bones (they have not lost it in the treatment of lipo suction or the usual function).
