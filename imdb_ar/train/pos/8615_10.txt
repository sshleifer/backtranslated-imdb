I've been waiting for this movie to come for a while in Canada and when it finally happened, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at first, it's a very sad film (and it was New Year's Day - which makes him more sad) - yet he sticks with you. The next day I was thinking about it again, because although it's about something emotionally draining, you realize a few days later it's a beautiful story. How one person can be seen as a link to many people, but sometimes can blind a lot of things. And how Diane Keaton's characters save the rest of them by being there. And how to save them in the process as well. It was a great film, and Chris Payne (one of my favorite actors) offers the perfect comedic comfort. It's definitely a movie that will need a tissue box, but it will stay with you for a long time.
