Fantastic movie, one of the best horror movies of the seventies. They are realistic settings and ambience. As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments. I have noticed that most horror movies in a certain period fail to reach enough. It is clear that most horror films are old and must be immersed. They are like the mental machinery that conveys the potential of critics here. <br /> <br /> Before you read the review, you already know what the final judgment is. In the film a good gift because 10 really good. Rains reads well and the film as a way to produce it reminds me of a lot of Kubrick movies. It's really impression. Really excellent movie. I consider the film a selection of 70 years.
