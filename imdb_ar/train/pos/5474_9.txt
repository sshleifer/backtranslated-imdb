The National Art Museum displayed the original lost version of this film, which was not thought long ago on July 10, 2005. It recreates the vital scenes the sergeant made when he was released. The character of the shoemaker, a moral figure in Judy in the original 1933 edition, is presented as an apprentice to the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use the men to claw her to the top. Also, the original end of the kernel that I assume is present in the current VHS versions is deleted and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and strength. We hope there will be a reissue of this movie on DVD to appreciate everyone for his wonderful qualities. look for it.
