In the Old West, there are always men who breathe violence and women who hold their breath. The famous "Tamer" in the city, "Klet Tolinger" (Robert Mitchum), where he was employed by citizens to disarm (Liu Jin, Claude Atkins, among others), covers the cars of Baronland. There he meets Emmanuel Meyer, his daughter (Karen Sharp), her boyfriend (John Lobton), Marshal (Henry Hall) and owner of the salon (Ted de Corsia). Clint was appointed as a law man as deputy peacemaker and put some cartels saying: WARNING, wearing arms or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all devices at Marshal's office. Clint finds his former girlfriend, Madame Local (Jean Stirling) responsible for the salon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council fears crude methods implemented by Clint. In the end the huge landowner appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his hands. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting story about a police sheriff versus a hire who had one other murder. He begins as a slow-moving westerner but follows us in surprise with dark characters and a solid plot. The tale is almost depressing, the lollipop comes to town in time to make sure its citizens but the events later get worse. The salient points are combustion in the saloon and climatic confrontation in the end. It's a great and wonderful role for Robert Mitchum as an avid angel and a bitter fighter, it's the whole show. A live and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Black and White Cinematography by Lee Garamis. Richard Wilson (Al Capone, three in the attic) realized an amazingly cinematic picture that made him Western like "Invitation to an Armed Fighter and Rings" by Zain Gray. The results of the texture of this strange West.
