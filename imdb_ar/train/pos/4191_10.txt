Sam Fuller's 1953 film contains some of his best works, and sadly he could not continue to get support from Hollywood's top studios for his purposes. The story line goes something like that. A solid petition (reading a prostitute) is a subway ride on a hot summer day, and you get her pocketbook by Scape McCoy. What Scape does not realize is that she carries some microfilm to pass it on to spies. This opening shot without dialogue, often in very close-up shots, is one of the many things that Fuller uses during the film. The babe known as Candy was Jan Peters, who never was better nor seemed better. One forgets how beautiful she was, and she plays this role very well. The Pickpocket plays by Richard Widmark, who has already made his mark, and put his style in the 1947 Kiss of Death as a mad creep with creepy laughter, and although it is a little "lighter" here, it is still scary. These solid-edged figures have soft spots here and there, but their lights are bad everywhere. The outstanding performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe the stoolie in saving her dough to pay for her funeral. Ritter got Oscar's candidacy for her performance, but she lost the dull and popular Donna Reed as a girl reading "From Here to Eternity". Hollywood loves it when a good girl gets hurt and loves her happiness, although her performance is usually terrible. See for example Shirley Jones in the film "Elmer Gantry." Located among diving docks in New York City, with a crisp white and black portrayal of Joe McDonnell and some very good artistic trends. From the river, it was made at the height of the Cold War and the Red Horror, and the villain of the piece is the ordinary Komi appearance, played by Richard Kelly who is far more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal attempt to earn a living and above all a loyal American.
