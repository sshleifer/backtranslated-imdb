A wonderful family drama / comedy starring McLean and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see her. It is highly recommended for all ages from 9 years old to grandmothers. The story of a beautiful time was captured in 1962. The story includes a stumbling neighbor, with her two children, and Zina (McLean) who are trying to cover their expenses without being a man of the family. The family goes west to take the legacy of a long-forgotten relative who left a runaway in a roadside cafe from the late 1940's. A stubborn, sweet but determined mother, the whole family gets to renovate and open the cafe. But wait ...... Aunt Accessories is an old actress in the circus with the tricks of magic cards and powders and the humor you love ... She likes to make children with her in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... What happens next is a wonderful combination Of the "miracle in the Lords" thrown with the Cuban missile crises (with authentic TV news from the real event) and the "ghost" joke that completely out of control. This film enjoys religious sequences, philosophies, doubts and gives a disturbing look at the frightening fear of Cuban missile crises in October 1962. In the end one is left with the wonder of faith, family and love revealed. Oh, and the music of the 1960s is very impressive! <br /> <br /> Highly filtered as FILM 10 of 10
