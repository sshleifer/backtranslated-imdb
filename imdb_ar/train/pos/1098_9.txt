Newcomers know this little film primarily as a model for re-release, "The Money Pit". Today's older viewers watch with the wisdom of nostalgia: Carrie Grant, Mirna Lowe and Melvin Douglas were "stars" in an easier and less complex era. Or was it? Time, of course, is a way of adjusting views, and with so many films today that are full of social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about the controversy in the old films, which seems less provocative. In Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, there may be more permission than the public sought in 1948. There is a political comment, however subtle. Finding a home in the late 1940s was a truly frustrating experience, somewhat mitigated by the advent of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the film? The Blanding children seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them at school (which in effect will make teachers accuse of communism). In real life too, Mirna Loy was a housing, democratic and feminist activist. Melvin Douglas was not a democratic minority: he was married to Congresswoman Helen Jhagan Douglas, whom Richard Nixon accused of conspiring with communism (which she destroyed). Jason Robards, Mr., plays a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less obvious. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr, will for many years be a very active liberal democrat. The curious colleague was Carrie Grant, whose sharp province reflected the feelings of the Hollywood majority that were already sliding. But that was 1948: Communism was a real threat and the black list was around the corner. Another decade has passed before political activity has re-emerged in major films, and therefore not so skillfully.
