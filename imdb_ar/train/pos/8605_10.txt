Janet MacDonald and Nelson Eddie starred in this "modern" music that depicts McDonald's comic abilities. Surreal 40s seems to be making fun of the 1940s, even in its current vogue. The costumes and collections that are visible (yes B & W) add to the dream-like surreal quality of the entire film. Many good songs are animated in the movie, with your "Twinkle in Your Eye" number, a distinctive number, including the interesting jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. The HUGE team includes Edward Everett Horton, Original Owen, Mon Maris, Douglas Dumbrell and Anne Jeffries. It has also been seen in long stretches such as Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many more. <br /> <br /> Great fun and nice to see McDonald's wonderful in her jitterbug / patch routine. She can do everything.
