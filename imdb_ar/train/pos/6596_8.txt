Brazilian films often get more positive ratings than they really deserve. Rather, Contra Todos (against everyone) (the original title, which was ignored by producers: God against everyone) got a very low cumulative rate (average point of appreciation) on this site. It seems to have been frankly rejected by the outsiders generally. In fact, it's not too brutal. I mean as far as graphic violence is concerned. His brutality is inherent in his portrayal of the potential, I mean the underprivileged citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment, and who perform cold-blooded orders against Gran Grada. Is this man after the talk? Is his / her condition just a very quick, personal and tolerant situation, amidst saturated meals? The picture may be the best Brazilian film of 2004, so far. The brilliant editing style, Ã  la Godard, his laughable points in the soundtrack, his overall work more than efficient, and above all, his original narration, with subtle, chronological dots that appear only at the end, deserve at least 8 marks.
