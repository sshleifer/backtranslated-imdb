I remember this movie many years ago. Definitely the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I vividly remember much of the film after a long time attests to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of bids because of the language barrier. But they were still very strong. <br /> <br /> This theme continues to fascinate us even as the years go by. It has been dealt with more effectively here, with the appropriate proportion of historical perspective and doubt. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there a technical archive of a film containing a copy of it ??
