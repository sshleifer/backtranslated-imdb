Reese Witherspoon was the first outing on the big screen and one memorable. It looks like a new, light-colored "tween" face, light and small, but Reese is undeniable. <br /> <br /> I've always loved her as an actor, and I had no idea she started this little girl in her career, go to figure. I have already gained some respect for Rees to see who she was very early on. I say that because the more you see her performance, the characters so far, in each picture, also seemed to have her own personality that lived with that character, actually quite well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first experience with Reese was a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, as Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, in one way or another that I assumed was the first time I got "in the bat"
