I settled back to watch "Read My Shepherd", a dish of Freedom Fries before me. The food was soon forgotten when it became immersed in the wonderful filmmaker and director Jack O'Dayar. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Devos) is a secretary at a company that is developing major construction projects. She already has some important responsibilities that do not often fall on the secretariat and are capable and ambitious. And the frustration of the hierarchy of males who will exploit but not equal. <br /> <br /> The work builds up faster than you can handle, asking Carla to appoint a secretary. Enter the ex con and layabout general Paul (Vincent Castell). He lied about his skills, and in fact he did not have anything that any project might require. After a serious misunderstanding at first by Paul regarding Carla's interest, the two became allies. Start the exotic friendship. In a trick that would make Carla a real major rival to the "trainee", she excels at her selfish male adversary in acting with Paul's collusion. The opponent left. <br /> <br /> Carla is deaf without hearing aid. With it almost commonly heard. The hearing system is closed to isolate itself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. They are also very lonely. A heroic make-up effort was made to make it look easy but really beautiful. She is not her boyfriend. She's a kindergarten so she can have a friend (it's a French film). The worst and the worst, joins her friend's appeal that she is hanging around somewhere while the married girlfriend stops with her companion in Carla's bed. Not nice. <br /> <br /> While Carla and Paul get to know each other better, the frantic side is barely visible from the former criminal. There is a side story, by the way, of Paul's relationship with the parole officer who carefully completes the master plan and has a big sudden end. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" Paul realizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a distance, is more than an amusing salon trick that seems to be at first. <br /> <br /> From there, greatness develops. He said enough. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are an eccentric couple who are criminals because she wants love but will also accept money. He wants it, somewhat, but the business must come before possible sexual gratification. Together, Cassel and Devos are powerful actors who carry the story of an extraordinary crime until its end in a very convincing way. <br /> <br /> You can rent or buy them but if you enjoy a good crime story, go to "Read My Lips". You may want to watch it several times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
