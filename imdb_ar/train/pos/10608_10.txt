This is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. I love the backwoods feel of this film. The film is very realistic and friendly. This seems to be happening in another era, perhaps in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Henry Thomas works well with the little boy. The story is very impressive and worth a look.
