I thought I should qualify my position after reading the other reviews. The movie is not great, but it has a lot of wonderful elements. The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are superb. The story is slow and weak but amusing. The representation is bad, but not worse than what you will find on SyFy. Good music and good humor. He has a big face for the skin in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the film in full and although it was mostly predictable, it was still fun. Women are attractive enough and the main actor performs a good job of brood and creepy. The film was remarkably clean for a modern film and violence suitable for children ages 13 and older. There was no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think it's fair. I was watching him again if I had nothing better to do. The gay landlord was the most disturbing aspect of the film, and the devil was completely creepy.
