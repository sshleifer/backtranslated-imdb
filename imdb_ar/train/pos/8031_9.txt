This is one military drama I like very much! Tom Berenger plays the military killer Thomas Beckett. This Marines is not nonsense, in your face, and there are no questions asking a kind of person who accomplishes the task. You have Billy Phine and others playing with Richard Miller, a former SWAT model, working for the government and receiving orders from them only. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When combined with these two conditions, sparks must fly. And how. However, Beckett knows how the young bureaucrat works. When the other sniper hits, it is smart versus intelligence, the cat versus the mouse, the gunman versus the gunman. When the veteran sniper is captured, it is up to Miller to set politics aside and save him. Whoever needs policy when he is a supporter like Beckett, he has received orders from someone other than himself, plays according to rules rather than writers, and mutual respect is done despite policy. The film was a direct hit. See this. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
