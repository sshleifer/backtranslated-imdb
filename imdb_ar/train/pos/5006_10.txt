I remember that I found this special thing while browsing the channel in 1965. I never heard of Barbara before. When the show ended, I thought "Maybe this is the best thing on TV I'll see in my life." After 42 years, this is true. Nothing is so amazing, so they are amazingly frank like the talent shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, and this is the most outstanding of them all! <br /> <br /> You can call it, it can do so. Comedy, Lamentations, Seduction Seduction, Stories, Barbara is really a story. Its ability to pull anything trying is legendary. But this was made special at first, and helped create a myth that it soon became. Despite her rise so far in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise and has revealed more of her talents as she continues. But they are all here from the start. You will not be disappointed in this view.
