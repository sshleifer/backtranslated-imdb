The writer / director / assistant star Adam Jones heads for great things. This is the idea I thought of after seeing his long film "Cross Eyed". Rarely leaves me independent film I feel as good as he did. Intelligently written and directed, Cross-Aid keeps you engaged from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a known name yet, but he will be. If this movie has one or two "featured actors," it will be a Box Office feeling. I think he still has a chance to see a major audience if only one filmmaker takes the time to run the movie. No matter where it ends, if you get a chance to see it, I will not be disappointed.
