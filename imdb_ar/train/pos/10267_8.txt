Much has been written about Mamet titled "House Games"; mostly good. I decided to review the click to see how I survived 17 years later and was surprised to see how much I enjoyed watching it again. The success and durability of the film is likely to have a great relationship with two main components: the fun of the film is always a good story and a good scam. Mamit was able to bring his distinctive temperament and clear history to the film while cheating, audience and tag at the same time. Then he explains the art of deception just to do it again, etc. Throughout the construction of the story. "The House of Games", now a freebie game on the cable, is worth searching for initial timings and a good restart for Mamet fans. (B +)
