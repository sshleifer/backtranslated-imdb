Clara Lago is as wonderful as the main character of the film, which is basically a film about a Spanish / American girl moving to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes to the house to die and leave with her grandfather. They also make friends and great experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Balestra) is initially a nuisance to her and then becomes close. The film is beautifully filmed and bathed in mostly soft colors. Carol longs for her father, who is a pioneer in the war, and you can feel that Cher loves him. While the war itself is a kind of back seat in this film, it encircles personal life. I think you will like it. See it especially for Clara Lago who does a wonderful job like Carol. Is definitely one to watch.
