One can only imagine Mr. Wills's film has ended without the intervention of the studio! This film is a drawback to Wales, but it deserves every minute of it because one can see the greatness of the best American film director perhaps at all times! <br /> <br /> We can see the losses incurred in filming Orson Welles from this film. The story contains a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of studio directors who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is strange to read some of the views presented to the IMDB that compare Orson Welles to the brothers Coen, Roman Polanski, and even Woody Allen, when all these directors should be considered to be followers of the Great Master himself. There was no one more creative and history in the history of American cinema than Mr. Wells. Fortunately, we still have a legacy both in retrospect, such as the film that has just ended from the New York Film Forum, or its films, either in the form of a tape or on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is never portrayed more lovingly than here if she is beautiful with her red hair, like a blonde, she is very amazing for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to add to the Orson Welles collection was his appearance in the film. Had he focused on directing and there was another actor explaining Michael O'Hara, maybe a different film would have been achieved. Orson Welles should be attributed to being a pioneer in pulling the camera from studio to street. The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the stage after watching this film and are truly impressed with the work, vision and talent it has given us.
