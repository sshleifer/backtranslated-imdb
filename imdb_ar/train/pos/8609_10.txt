I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a wonderful story line and showed that people are very complex in all kinds of different ways. Recommended it to all my friends! I always enjoy a good storyline and this film was one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself as a daughter and do the same things Natalie did to learn more about her life and love her. He showed us how not only live with our families; but also there are parts of our lives that we do not share with them - where it may not be in their interest to know all the details of things we do not do and which we take pride in. /> I am looking forward to another film like this, will keep my eyes.
