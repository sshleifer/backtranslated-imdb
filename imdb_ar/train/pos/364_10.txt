Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the popular novel Alice and the Cherry is not without his share of controversy. When black community members first criticized his treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man had directed the film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Sealy, who grew up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children by her abusive father who was snatched from her arms at birth. Her only consolation comes from her miserable life from her sister. <br /> <br /> Sealy (later played by newcomer Wobi Goldberg) married an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by the sister, so they are quickly removed from Sealy's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often told as Sealy continues to hope that she will reunite with her sister one day and with her children. Throughout her life she met a variety of characters, including Sophia, a tough wife as a nail to her son, and Chug, a noisy and fat salon singer, learned a thing or two about love. <br /> <br /> Direction Speilberg is all over this image, which offers brilliant cinema and some great performances. I challenge you to watch this movie and do not move! The Color Purple was able to capture the essence of the complex story. Although he tends to reduce the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both were very wonderful in the book, the film is still faithful to its themes, allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to answer the controversy surrounding this film. Suffice it to say, however, that this is one of the few films I can see over and over again, which left an indelible imprint. <br /> <br />
