I thought about how the Grinch Stole Christmas was so good. It was not terrible, and it was not wonderful, but it was fun watching it. I felt as if Jim Carrey had been annoying at times. A special educational person, when all he needed was to be evil and wary, but nevertheless turned into a kind of retarded. I think the scene, when I'm not inside the Grinch cave, was nice, and there were some parts I laughed at, but most of the time I thought it was annoying. This film could have been "better" if they changed the character of Grinch, and they included some more laughter scenes, because most humor was not funny. I loved how Grinch stole Christmas anyway, but it was not a thrill to see.
