The low-budget Brit Briton focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, become one and then finds it too much. The cast can not hide well and feel the time and place the fact that we are all here before. Many of the scenes are a little hysterical and the sound of O'Connor is very much like a mini-mouse! Disappeared shortly after the production of this film - so life can imitate art! You should know if you want to see a punk version of Star Is Born though.
