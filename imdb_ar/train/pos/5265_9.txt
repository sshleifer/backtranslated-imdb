I can remember watching this for the first time, when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the Berber brothers. This film is still wonderful. The original side was one that scenes of fighting where very short. Which means that the "barbaric brothers" are so good that they ended up there enemies quickly! In addition, you have chases, battle crate, dragon, and yes even bar brawl! <br /> <br /> Yes, the representation is bad, for this reason it was not ten, as the line of the story received a lot of criticism. I think it's completely original. Many of the films in this genre do not have the same lines as the original story, or color dialog. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
