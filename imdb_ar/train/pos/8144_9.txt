After seeing both "Fear of the Black Hat" and "This is the Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that, although they are similar, both films should really be seen. There will be several times in the "fear" that will make you hysterical. No wonder both films are like a huge cult. Fear will soon be available on DVD. Hire it if you need it, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to get it yourself.
