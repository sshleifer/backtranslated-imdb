The payment of daisies is indeed a milestone in television as a technical form. Everything seems to be hailed by Amelie and Tim Burton, but what in this world where new ideas are obviously rare will ensure that you do not care whether they are new or not. It's just fantastic. <br /> <br /> I've been captured from the beginning and smart writing and direction to the backgrounds and dialogue make this exhibition more impressive masterpieces since The Shield and The Wire (well, not quite good) comparisons but the beauty of daisies is that there are no comparisons on television) . <br /> <br /> Really addicted and absolutely pleased. Probably like one of the Piemakers pies that are mentioned in these exciting ways.
