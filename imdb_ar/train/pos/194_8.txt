Probably the most entertaining "behind the scenes Hollywood movie" ever, especially for a look at short comedy factories such as Keystone. <br /> <br /> Marion Davis must get a medal of courage to play a role in which she behaves poorly in front of the camera is part of the role. Lots of engravings for movie buffs.
