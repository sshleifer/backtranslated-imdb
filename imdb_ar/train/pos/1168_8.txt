Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian professional killer or professional killer, decides to leave the job, and his former employers do not agree. As far as content is concerned, this highly moving motion picture does not contain a film; in terms of absolute entertainment, it is fun ?? It's very melodramatic, violent, very brutal, the car chases remarkable. "Arzenta" is a modest film, but very lovable, much better than the current trash in Hollywood that got the same rating. It comes from Delon's short film, which jokes with Italian cinema B in the 1970s. He carefully uses the character of the powerful Dillon man, who belongs to the gallery of evil thieves who made him in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Dillon made this film, and that he had a role in making a good Eurocream. <br /> <br /> The result is very good, with a good introductory song - making this look great for the Italians for the film, which is considered an artificial work, where music plays an important role. <br /> <br /> In the highly attractive Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out The Erika, Blanc (31, in 73) looks like an unnamed whore. Meanwhile, Sandra Sandante's girlfriend plays the role of Carla Gravina (the star who left the films practically after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" was filmed surprisingly? Visual vision is ambitious, some exotic expressive angles. The film is directed by Doshio Tesari, who also produced Zoro (Comedy Dillon). Needless to say, these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zoro, are quite different. The first is the melodramatic violence bloody action film - the second is a tepid comedy, more like a parody, although it is wonderfully coherent and skillful. Duccio Tesari has directed films such as Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of the Devil, The Bloodst Butterfly Butterfly, ¡° Viva La Muerti ... Just! Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
