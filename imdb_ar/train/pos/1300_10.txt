I first saw a section of this DVD in a hifi show in November 2006 in London (I have not really been so generous !!). It was through the advanced Arcam system, it looked great with DTS. I had to get this DVD. I will tell you that this is the most exciting music DVD I have ever seen. The performance of Cream in their time was just trivial and sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a music DVD. No matter what kind of music you love, this music will definitely grow. It is a tremendous brilliance for its performance that will make you see it again and again. Even new musicians do not cut mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
