I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student, and the majority is a waste of normal time on American television. This one, however, was well crafted and plotted and was a very nice twist in the end. After seeing only Richard Dean Anderson at MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance instead of the series of A-B expressions he normally offers. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zunega a long time back to The Fly II. It is also good to see Robert Guillaume in a leading role again. I can not say that I took Jane Jeffs seriously after Penny Hill days, but she managed to adapt well to her role. All in all A highly recommended film.
