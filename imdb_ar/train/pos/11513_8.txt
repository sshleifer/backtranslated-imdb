One of my favorite programs in the 1970s. As I recall, it was aired on Friday (or maybe Saturday) on Nine (?) Here in Australia. Daren McGavin and Simon Oakland were both great. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually reached its climax where Kolchack was forced to take part in the fighting along with some kind of supernatural opponent. To their great satisfaction, the book made concerted efforts to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode in which the opponent had the spirit of an ancient Indian commander, of "Aad", as a huge electric current that began to kill people in the city hospital. The final confrontation Kolchack saw a short-circuit "Power Monster" attempt amid an explosion of sparks and flames rise. Well ... you had to be there at that time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always mobilized a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his roles and this was one of his best. Definitely worth a place in the TV Hall of Fame. In the words of Tony Vincenzo .... "Kolchack you are on IT" ... or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "in it"!
