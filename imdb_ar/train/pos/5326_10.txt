"The Birth of the Beatles," being an American television film released in the fall of 1979, was by far the best film to tell the story of the four Liverpool players who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As he said from the perspective of the former Beetle the best house. The performance of the entire cast was excellent, but Stephen McKenna performed as John Lennon and Rod Kolbertsson as Paul McCartney. The film produced the rock and roll era legend, Mr. Dick Clarke. Who produced a previous year in 1978 another television film, stood the test of time from Kurt Russell in the lead role of another musical legend, Alves. This film was directed by an unknown director named John Carpenter who continued to produce other successful films such as Halloween, Escape from New York and The Thing. The same could be said for the director of "The Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Richard Markand. He went on to guide other play films such as "Star Wars Return of Jedi", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story of Fab4, which I know is "Back Beat," which was released in 1994. However, critics did not care about it, and the audience did not care about it, because it did not have a long life in theater. Beatles is a very charming and simple film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend, the struggles and hardships they have experienced and ends at the top of their success when they arrive in New York City and appear at Ed Sullivan in 1964. I highly recommend this film.
