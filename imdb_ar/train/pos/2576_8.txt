I'm from Christopher Reeve the Generation, it's fair to say that he was the best actor to play with Superman so far, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in this role, and George Reeves makes a very good show to knock Chris off the top, Shorten. This does not prevent me from enjoying this film, but it has a lot to do. Contains all that the film needs, a plot with a beginning, a middle, and an end, in addition to all those parts written intelligently. The film is steeped in acting and stories, a noir film but with tights. The story is both dramatic and meaningful, it is a film with a message that is not very conscious. I'm still amazed that this was filmed in 12 days, glory days in Hollywood, when we did not have to wait for only 5 years to see if the film would join the hell of development ... The movie is polished and expertly produced by Lee "Roll ' em "Sholem, known for output with both speed and effectiveness. Never allow technology restrictions to slow it down; in fact there are some creative things that have been done to create a flying effect, including putting a camera in the lever lever and shooting high and traveling quickly to make it look as seen from Superman's point of view, Action, and a long shot of superman animation. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an added bonus in the first season of the George Reeves TV series. There is a DVD worth owning on its own, and the entire movie is included on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give blood today bless God!
