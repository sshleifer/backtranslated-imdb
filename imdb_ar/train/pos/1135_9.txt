I saw this first in the movie theater when I came out, and the audience was in the film which made the experience more enjoyable. These are a wonderful collection of characters, many of them big names, few of which have been recognized as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or you like them in other movies, to add them to your watch list. Some scenes actually remind me of the kind of comedies like The Birdcage or Even The Clue, a kind of exotic comedy that shows up automatically, with some professional performances from these beloved actors. The film has done a great job in giving you some insight, and perhaps very realistic, about the daytime soap culture.
