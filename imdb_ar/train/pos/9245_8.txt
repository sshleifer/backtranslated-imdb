Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on the screen and this could be their best film together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be both cheese and predictable, but that's not what I like in the film. I love seeing Harlow and Jable together and in this film it was simply fantastic. They obviously really enjoyed working together and that's part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> Skillful dialogue, great text and attention to detail are the other things that make this movie a good movie. I liked this movie the first time I saw it, and in every subsequent viewing, I always noticed at least one new detail. For me, this is a great movie sign. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script are better than most films of this time period (early thirties). I adore classic movies, but I admit that most are average and sometimes do not care about me. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a 'pre-code' movie. (The Hays icon was not applied until a year later on Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be produced under the icon. Well, it was possible to make it, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God, the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we missed this gem.
