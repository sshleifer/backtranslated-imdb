Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel sympathetic to. Although their home was dirty, this is somewhat understandable given their mental illness. On the bulletin board, a poster wrote that "Little Eddie has the coping skills of an eight-year-old child." Reminds me when Big Edie says in Little Edie's 2009 drama: "If you're stuck, it's only with yourself!" These women were everything. Beauty, talent, intelligence, firm faith in their opinions and actions. Maybe if Little Edie were not tough on herself the first time things did not work out, and she lost her hair, her work, and her love of life, she would have done it. This is somehow related to what I think is her mental illness: her inability to catch herself when the times are difficult and she sees that good times are waiting for her. The world will never know what happened if she does not listen to her mother's call, "Come home, Eddie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, these women are unsafe in a way that is understandable and somehow miraculous, tragic, and beloved, even in their very dirty home. These women were unusual, and their interaction with each other brings humor and sadness. When Eddie is exposed to one of her emotional breakdowns, or I talk about what she can be, or how she wants to get out of her house because she feels like a little girl, one strongly urges him to hug her and tells her that "everything will be fine!" <br /> < Brilliant documentary! <br /> <br /> 9/10
