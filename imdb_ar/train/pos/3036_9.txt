The name says just everything. I watched this movie with my father when he came out and served in Korea, and he enjoyed great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this film is that it focuses only on a short period of man's life - it is interesting that the entire man's life would have made this vital picture so epic that it is amazing to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters escape the flawed characteristics of men, which are cheap shots. The theme of "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just words uttered by a high-ranking officer - it is a profound declaration of one man's devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, a liberal Beck has a better understanding of the man. It does a wonderful job showing the brave and diluted general with the human side of the man.
