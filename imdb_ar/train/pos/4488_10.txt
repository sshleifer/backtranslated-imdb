Here is my favorite cartoon Tom and Jerry are perfect for Halloween. I know it did not have much crawling, but it has the "trick" as in "Trick or Treat", as Jerry did with Tom with the blind window and the vacuum cleaner with a shirt held on it to make it like a ghost; but still want to put it on my list of Cartoon Halloween. In short, Tom was listening to the "Witching Hour", a ghost story on the radio, fearing a horror story being told. In the middle of the story, dramas begin (the hair finally stands, the heart in the throat, and the chills on the spine) happen to Tom. . . Literally. Jerry was watching everything and laughing at himself, thought to increase Tom's fears by intimidating him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a bit funny. You know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mami Toe shoes. The others are the only mouse, the mouse at home, and the nitty witty kitty. Also this is the first of twenty-five comics in which Tom talks. Loneome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quiet Please !, Trap Happy, Serenade Solid, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse, The Cat above and the mouse below. Directed by Chuck Jones.
