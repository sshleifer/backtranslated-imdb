I found "time on top" an amusing and stimulating experience. Acting, although not great in general, was quite acceptable and sometimes very good. A sponsor clearly aims at a younger demographic, it is certainly one of the best works in this genre (science fiction for children). Usually, I would say that Canada, the UK and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for kids, and Time at the Top does nothing to reduce this theory! I do not think that continuity and great representation are important for young people. The good plot and the fantasy scenario are far more important to them. Both are in abundance in this film. Special effects are good, without detracting from the story, or closing viewers off their own imagination. It was very easy to pump an excess load of SFX into this film, but it would completely destroy the "Raison D'etre" completely. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are very high in this film, complementing the exquisite wardrobe and historical accuracy. In general, this film is very satisfactory, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who try like me! Now, I have to read the original book, as soon as possible.
