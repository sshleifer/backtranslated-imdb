Hilarious, disgusting, confusing, wonderful movie. Reminds me of L'Or D'D'Or from Bonwell or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain - a lot of strange characters hiding and looking for ..... What is it? I laughed almost all the way, all the while observing the periphery of the puzzling and sometimes terrifying reactions to the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertaining through and across, from the beginning to courage and poisonous luggage all the way to the end, if the end. I just wish to remember all the details. Sometimes it bothers me. <br /> <br /> Frankly, however, I have only the most positive memories of this film. Since it does not seem available to go home and watch it, I suppose I'll have to wait a few years for Crispin Glover to come back with the big slide show (and then "What's it?") ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost immediately after my participation In a fairly devastating car accident, so I was a bit surprised at the time, which was perhaps a good state of mind to watch the arthropods of the Prophet's Hadith, the delay in supernatural fashion and divine glamor in his proper, full-bodied state, girls wearing thin clothes from the ground like the wonderful wet DADAist dream. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement of life as we know it? Of course everyone expects art to be just that. I think the truth is clearer in absence and in negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to learn, but it is much more valid than the lies that others feed day after day. Instead of one "What is it?" Of more than 5000 films such as Titanic or Sleepless in Seattle. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Mr. Glover (in addition, a fun man to watch on screen or in his Big Slide Show - clever, funny, quirky, and outrageously hot). Make more movies, write more books, and keep the nightmare alive.
