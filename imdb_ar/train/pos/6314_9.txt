I went to the cinema with two of my friends and I chose this movie from the hat, and I do not know exactly what to expect. It has turned into a very fun and funny experience! It's an excellent film with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. It is clear that all the characters are made in the style of "Italian Comedian" Alan Ford, but that did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of losers made a very unique and enjoyable film. Sam Rockwell has given a very good and convincing role, and so is Messi. I hardly know him. But the real star is actually Gozman. He played a part in his life in this film! Scene When his character Cosimo dies in the film, he is so funny that he made me choke and I almost die with him! Highly recommended to all fans of "Alan Ford"!
