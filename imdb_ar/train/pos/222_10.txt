Neil Simone's comedy comedy that evokes laughter from start to finish. The late Walter Matthau is the hideous comedian who was persuaded to join with his former partner, George Burns, to participate in the final reunion show on stage. Agent and nephew, and both have the same amount of chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's angry personality - he is exactly the same as he always is, but he is also quite different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like the absent-minded old man, is as funny as Matthau. <br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want some crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and Graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: What about a regular cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I do not feel comfortable. I've got coconut, pineapple and Graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Well <br /> <br /> Matao: They're in the closet in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or what about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I did the black color, the eggs knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> To see it in the film to understand it! <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun, sweet, hearty, warm, hearty comedy with heart and some memorable quotations of all time. <br /> <br /> No longer makes them like this anymore! While all comedies are modern, cynical and stupid, this tends to the basic direction of what comedy truly represents - funny characters, intelligent and funny dialogue, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedy friends ever, there is directly with "planes, trains, cars", "deadly weapons" and "hard way". <br /> <br /> You may find it difficult to find this in order to rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 Stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
