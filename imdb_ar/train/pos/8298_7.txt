Better than the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL has a great view (Uric, Luci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown, Joe Rigalbuto, Solay Mun-Frei) and a major conceptual update of the familiar Faustian plot. Urich is as gracious as ever, and Luchi brings with courage all the top in all the charming roles of women. A kind of mixed version of STEPFORD WIVES and THE LIVE, the film is committed early by its horrific Miltonesque movie and fans of horror will not have many complaints until the mystery is removed. 10/07
