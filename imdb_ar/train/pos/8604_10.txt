I know that a lot of people do not like this movie, but I think it's wonderful. I can not say much, but the film is a film feel good. Beautiful songs, beautiful costumes, beautiful sounds, and there are a lot of ridiculous lines in the film, especially as Bregita learns what the community does and does not do. If you like musicals, I tell you that you like it!
