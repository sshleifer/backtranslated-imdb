The Ghost Train is fun for those who appreciate the typical humor of the 1940s. It merges World War II into the plot but not as far as I thought at first, the characters are a unique combination that plays its roles fairly well. Askey, who plays Tommy Gander, is what lights the story for parts that can be portrayed as boring or "drag". <br /> <br /> The story of the inhabited station is already frightening even today's standards today. It's unique, and the way the characters communicate with everything wonderful to enliven the mystery is The Ghost Train. Gander is a nuisance to all other members, while the rest are fairly well-matched. It is always the focus of attention and can be described as "annoying" but it is by those who can not hum in 1940. His humor is innocent and childish making it look sweet. <br /> <br /> If this movie is not for Askey / Gander, this movie will be shorter at work, enjoy it and the result will not be effective in my opinion.
