Come on, people. This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening ... The rich have done more crazy things than this. It was fun. <br /> <br /> I watch comedy for entertainment, to escape the pressures of the world for a short time, and not to have to take anything seriously. This film fits perfectly for this purpose. I judge the film based on its own merits, and I am not about to compare "Christmas Survival" with "Fires in the Saddles." I have seen that people who are completely dysfunctional in their jobs turn into lovable people who can easily live in the street from my home. It will remain on my list "Favorites ..... Must be viewed for the holiday season". If you just want to have fun for 90 minutes, watch this moment.
