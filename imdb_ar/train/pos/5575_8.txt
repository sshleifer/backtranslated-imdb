I did not expect much of this, but I had to admit that I was rolling on the ground and I laughed several times during this film. If you have not been grossly abused in the first 10 minutes, this may be a movie for you. As previously, if you are the type who will enjoy watching the Amanda Peet mixing cards for an hour and a half. Sure, it's not a great deal of comedy, but given Andy's low-budget composition, that's good. To settle the pitch for comparison, imagine all studio movies with their budgets upside down by 100 or so and see what you get! Glory to Peter Cohen and his network to see this through. I look forward to his next effort.
