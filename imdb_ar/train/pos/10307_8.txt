I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It is not preaching, it is not based on morality, nor should it be controversial. It is just God. No God is possible, regardless of religion. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays the role of Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is usually stuck on the lighter side of the news and desperate to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor position . This is what slowly drives his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the last straw is executed, he hastens to not laugh, but screams in the face of God, which in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for him, so his sin is to help others, as he continues to miss his power. At the same time, his constant arousal of his life makes him more selfish and leaves his relationship on a dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a long time. But as a plot, it works fine. A step-by-step fashion in which we face the challenges of being much better than combining our problems together, they are able to hide themselves fairly well. <br /> <br /> As you probably learn to hear about this in the first place, Carrie's ideal representation remains a personal figure (which fortunately is enough), and controls and gives an atmosphere to the scene of the film according to the scene. Whether they admit it or not, the role has been written or rewritten exclusively for Carrie. Without it, the humor will become flat, as humor is half the execution. The humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrie, it would be good to feel "a wonderful life". <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is wonderful, and no matter what some say, do not act like the only excuse for the third act. At least, do not think so when you see it. She makes a strong performance and makes you forget that you are watching a movie, and she and Carrie feel strongly as a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see the film to understand it), has a nice feeling, treats the idea appropriately and better than expected, and generally should not have been called a slap together just to save Carrie's career (which was not going to Anywhere)
