When this was first broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our first VHS recorder. I still have an aging bar that I try to watch every year. That was the year my first child was born, and Carol's Christmas vision in this incarnation brings back wonderful memories of the happy times - which I spent hours with this film playing in the background. I finally broke down this year and requested a DVD, which stopped me from writing a short reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens is beautifully captured here. George S. Scott is very amazing and absolutely believable like Scrooge. The cast support is equally amazing. This, in my opinion, produced flawlessly. Small details add a lot to the fun. Play the game Scrooge's nephew and his wife in playing with the party guests elegant element. (I re-established it with my high school English students as a short break from work in class!) Originally sponsored by IBM. (By the way, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original IBM ads ... which shows how computers have evolved in 21 years.) Conclusion: Carol Christmas is an immortal story, and this delivery is timeless classic. Enjoy ... God bless us, each one!
