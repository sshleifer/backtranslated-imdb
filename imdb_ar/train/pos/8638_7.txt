David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of reporters who want to go to California, but they can not afford it, so they ride a "partnership" with other young couples (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save money. (Forbes) is a photographer, and what they do not know is that Beth (Earley) and Lewis are a serial killer and a friend agrees to what he says, I do not care about a house as a rule, but it does justice to psychological roles, and the scary thing is that it performs well; I already knew people like him before, no, not killers, but with the same mentality. However, as the road journey continues, They lack money, but it seems that Earley always got the money in some way .. I do not mind that It leaves dead people here and there to do so. Lewis does her turn, one that excels, a waif that is incandescent and has a good heart, but she does not understand that she does not have to be beaten by Earley when she does something he does not like. As things begin to get even more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be turned off at a gas station. Unfortunately, at this point, she sees a news bulletin telling her exactly who is riding, and then things go downhill Them in a quick clip. This is not the biggest flick in the world, but it's not bad ... I've seen what was supposed to be the "unclassified" version but I wonder how much was excluded from the workbook, because that seemed a bit nervous to me. This does not make a family taxi or anything, unless the Manson family. 7 of 10.
