Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes of all, with a narrow lead over Basil Rathbone's great course, and perhaps this is the best adaptation to the short story of Don Connell. <br /> <br /> The lengthy amendment includes some new plot lines that are well suited to the surrounding drama and increase Milferton's hatred. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances in all respects, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick are fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a wonderful piece of drama.
