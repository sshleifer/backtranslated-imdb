The film "Itch in Time" by Bob Clambet is seven minutes of crazy work from a very small hypothesis. Elmer Vood tells his dog that if he scratches himself again, he'll get a scary bathroom. Unfortunately for a dog, fleas make it relentless to stop scratching. The cartoon moves between the progress of the fleas inside the dog's fur and its desperate attempts to overcome it. In a gorgeous sequence embodies the fact that the itch frustration can not be scratched, the dog changes its color from brown to blue to red to dotted plaid! Surrealism seems ironic, but it excites the indescribable feeling of itching in a way only Clampett can do. There are many other elements that make the "itch in time" pure Clampett. There is a grotesque concept in itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of fleas that chew on dog meat. There is unrestrained violence that raises his head in any scene that shows the cat. It is worth mentioning that there are dirty jokes including a huge shot from behind the dog that causes a wolf flea whistle and a hysterical sequence where the dog tries to scratch itself by dragging its ass along the ground. He stopped for a moment to address the audience: "Hey, I'd better do it. With a very limited concept, Clampett managed to make "An Itch in Time" a unique cartoon based on detail. Like an early episode of "Seinfeld", "Time Itch" does not mean anything very funny.
