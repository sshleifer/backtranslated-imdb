If you are under the age of 13 or older than 13 and you are very drunk, you will enjoy the war of war. If you are a serious fan of all types of anaerobic motion films, you will enjoy the D-war experience. Otherwise, do not bother! I watched the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and that made me feel good. After the film ended, all the children (my nephews and friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. The acting and directing are shocking. Very simple story. But because half of the audience were children, they screamed, screamed and chanted every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to convey to your kids, but except for the final sequence of the battle, D-War is disappointing. I gave this movie 7 out of 10 because the kids loved it so much.
