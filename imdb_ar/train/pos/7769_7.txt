Lauren Bacall was living through the illness of Humbert Bogarts husband and death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of Jomtien in 1950. Dorothy Malone is in excellent condition and won an Oscar for support. Robert Stack was nominated and shortened his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a little soap from another time but equally important as most dramas. It is amazing to what extent drunkards can drive in this film and also how quickly Stack is stacked in a couple of early sequences of films. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is very good and the production is already very good. Hassan. You can say that Bakal distracts you during this film as if it was well represented, but it seems emotionally drained in some sequences. <br /> <br /> Sexual references in this film are so mild that many young viewers today will not realize what they are. The film does a good job of telling a story, and in fact leaves a sequel to make in the end, although nothing has been done at all - although writing "Beyond the Wind" would be a good title.
