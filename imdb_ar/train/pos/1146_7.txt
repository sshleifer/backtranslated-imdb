This film revolves around the fictional soap opera. It's fast and very funny. To say anything else would ruin the film. There are many conspiracies and sub plots in the film. This film features a cast of actors with the most important stars of the day. They all give over top performances. This film is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is ideal for lovers of either the daytime soap opera / opera or soap in the first times!
