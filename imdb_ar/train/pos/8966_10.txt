This is a wonderful film, making the 1950s a beautiful and elegant look. Kim Novak is interesting and charming as a modern-day witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the wonderful supporting performances, from Jack Lemmon as her annoyance from Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as Mexico's Magic composer who works on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as minor bats as well as Witchy Aunt Queenie and then there's the cat - I have no idea how many witches I've launched The name of Pyewacket cat but they suggested a zillion. James Stewart seems to be out of place, but as far as his character appears outside the game; in this strange sub-world of magic and sorcery. perfect. It has a perfect happy romantic ending, which we believe in because the movies of this old game have those happy endings. Surely Gillian and Chip have a great chance to be as happy as Rose and Charlie Allent at The African Queen (another great movie)
