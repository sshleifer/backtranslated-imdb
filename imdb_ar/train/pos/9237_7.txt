This movie is very good half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original film. I have seen the series a good movie, but here, they have compiled "Life Legend, Parts I and II" and "Fire in Space" together. As they did with the first film, but with other episodes. But still, is a very good film. The end is just weird (do not see what's going on with Pegasus). But I still think it is very good. The actors and special effects were good. If you do not see it, check it out. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Green, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stover.
