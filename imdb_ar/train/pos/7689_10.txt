This was what black society was like before the rift epidemics, gangs, and AIDS that came to life in the 1980s. A respectable and diligent family struggled to get all the shocks and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the 1970s. Still full of hope and rising above the civil rights movements of the 1960s, the times were difficult but still worth fighting for. Keep your head on the water and make a wave when you can. This exhibition shows how black society struggled to work together as individuals and families before they began to prey on each other and everyone to survive the horrors of the Jewish neighborhoods. It is sad to see how black ghettos were at that time and what they are now.
