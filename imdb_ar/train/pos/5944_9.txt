I'll say this to start with: ... why, oh why, can not WB do what these short film directors do? Sandy is obviously a wonderful manager and deserves some credit from the World Bank and the capital. But I think they were on the brink when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 could make a champion champion. The World's Finest is one of the best short films I have ever seen, a video clip or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a genius choice. Let's face it people, Superman is not a great model. It may be handsome, but it is not. I do not know what it was some of the comments above, but Superman is really fat (have you ever read Superman comedy?). I think that this fact alone is only on my floors ... it seems like a clear choice to get someone who has a real muscle mass to play a superhero instead of a beautiful face. Same for Batman, Bartram is in an incredible position, and Batman is excellent ... I do not know men ... if a bigger budget is allocated and his own film ... I think Bale and Bartram will be Neck and Neck. Bottom line, this is one of the very few Super-Hero movies with actors actually looking for the segment. <br /> <br /> The Acting is also lovely. I do not know what everyone is talking about, O'Haren is not that bad. He's a damn damned as Superman, Bartram ... well, it's Batman. I mean, come to people, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what would you expect? Everyone else is very cool, except that Two-Face seems crazier than usual ... but hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lewis is also very hot. <br /> <br /> The SFX is very sweet. I mean, seeing Superman lift the car up ... man! , How wonderful. In contrast to the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I had to put this over it, because Mike actually looks like a fly, and so easily. Flying sequences have left something that is required, but again, with a larger budget ... Oh, and even he used the Batmobile! (Probably a model, but it looked convincing damned). <br /> <br /> All in all, the only fall of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. WB refuses to recognize that Collora is a reliable manager, and must be regardless of the type of project ... but no, he (like most Marvel projects) will continue to get these inventors who show almost no consideration to the masses and what they care about, View these gambling videos. Thankfully, Superman's return was successful, or it would be dangerous. The best game in the world, and in my book is the movie Superhero.
