LOVE AT THE TOP - The wrong American title for the wonderful French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is an authentic film, the fact that it dates back to 1974 is more spectacular. This film was too advanced for its time; even with the highest current standards, they achieve things that look rich and new. Filmed by the great director Michelle Deville, he defies description in the way he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex, and irony in one perfectly original mix - leaving in the end a big but subtle surprise to make it all gone By suddenly sad and more understandable. Cast wonderful, as well as writing and theme. But it's the delicious Deville tone, which keeps you always unbalanced but unattractive, that has pushed this "lost" movie to a very high level already. (The interview written with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
