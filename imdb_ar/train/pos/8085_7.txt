One thing I can say about this movie is too long, too long! I bought this movie recently two months ago with a vision of a new version. I was happy when I found that it was made in 1978 because the 1970s (although I did not live in it) is actually one of my favorite contracts, especially for music! When I watched this movie, the story was very good at first, but after about 50 minutes, it started to become very boring and repetitive. I will admit that the animation did not fascinate me! It was not something I had ever seen before and was very impressive. But the film frankly could have been a little better, he had a lot of talk and story about him more than 15 to 20 minutes of scenes just fought. Then for the last 5 or 10 minutes, I picked up the movie and got alright again but it ended unexpectedly. In my opinion I thought it was too long. I know that 13 minutes in two hours and still long for animation, but since it was boring for most of the film, it seemed like it was for 4 hours !!! But overall, I think it's a good film, and I'll see it again on one of "nothing days do." I will see a new one and I hope it will be better!
