A group of American students and their teacher decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite repeatedly warning them of the dangers of being lost on the beaten path (by a local creepy Irish man), they do just that, and end up on the outside side of a family of innate carnivores (descendants of the family of pancakes) the notorious Sawney Bean clan, according to For a silly plot of the film, the sticks were lifted from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Island). <br /> <br /> If you think that porn stars plus low horror in the budget are automatically equal to tons of nudity and awful representation, then think again: The Evil Breed is full of adult stars, but in fact, there is almost no nudity Which one might expect in view of the "talent" involved, and the representation, although far from an Oscar worthy, is bad (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, whom we know Frenchmen can do, but the Irish are bad). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in a wonderful style with the brutal carnage of a couple of love. Camp: After briefly having sex under the canvas, the enhanced silicone huti was dragged out of the tent and torn into two halves; the man had cut his arms and legs and roasted to spit. It's a great start, and bodes well for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things begin to fall dangerously: we have identified the main characters, an annoying bunch of only twenty people begging to become cannibal food, and are exposed to a fair amount of wasting In the form of some terrible false fears, a lot of facts about the deadly depression of local Irish idiot Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, a postmodern, postmodern conversation about horror films conventions (How Smart!). <br /> <br /> Then, as it seems as if the movie will never improve, the Christian director decides Viel to be serious: a man collides with a knife in the head and there is a sexy scene during the shower featuring a pretty blonde girl Gillian Leigh (not a porn star, But I'm sure there is a profession there waiting for if I want it). After that, things get better quickly with cannibalism beginning at the top of the meat-eating tools, and the film turns into a real bloodbath: Gary recently hit the sickle (about time!) And choked his bowels; Jenna Jameson is torn and open and has silicone breast implanted by cannibalized cannibals; Taylor Hayes is seen as bloody and bruised naked with a dead fetus between her legs (in particular, she has been caught and used as a breeding stock). <br /> <br /> All of this is so strange that seating makes things less interesting and you get the final Evil Breed Rating 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB. Very turbulent production and interference in the studio led Christian Vail eventually to abandon the project. The shootings were repeated and the injustice was severely cut for release in the United States. The good news is that although the film does not flow as it may be, and cursed by a terrible end, it seems that the British DVD (the version I saw) remained relatively intact with respect to the spots (only 13s of the film was cut in total).
