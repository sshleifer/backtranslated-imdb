I've seen this movie years ago on television late at night. At that time, I went under the title "Stairway to Heaven". Even when I was young, I remember being deeply touched by the story and the visual effects of the trial in court shocked me (those who saw it knew what I was talking about). This fantasy! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is directly in line with the greatest classic classics: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film has been rated highly by IMDB voters and rightly so - more than 51% of voters are 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated it 8 or above out of 10. I was surprised that it was not included in the best list 250 films until I realized that a few people saw / rated this movie, compared to those on the list. Unfortunately. I hope this movie will be released on Region 1 (North America) DVD, such that 1), I can buy it, 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
