The 1986 Italian-French edition of a film of the same name evokes the heat early, and does not allow us to get out of the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Petistales) who can not close his eyes to the mysterious beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Marocca Dietmers) who lives next to the school. One day, he follows, and his steadfastness pays off. There is only one problem: it deals with an initial character (Ricardo di Torrebrona) who may have committed or do not commit a heinous crime, and if repented, they are likely to be left with a slap on the wrist. Also, the young woman is "funny in the head", which is confirmed when she discovers that she was seeing the boy's father, a psychologist. Julia's emotional instability is matched only by her wonderful sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the floor go, with filaments and bad and bomb performance from the Detmers, who plays us like yo-yo (as do the boy) from scene to scene, with enough suspense to keep us guessing up - and even after - the end. Available in versions R and X (!)
