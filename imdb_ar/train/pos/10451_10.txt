"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be one of the best 5 movies I have ever loved. Dialogue and representation are great. I love personalities, their ideas and their ideas. Of course, the romantic Vienna, presented in the film is absent (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and not all places can be reached in just one night either (especially if you are a stranger and the first night in Vienna). But this is not a point. The relationship between the two letters is much more important, and this part of the story is absolutely unrealistic. Although nothing happened at all, the film never tired. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a bit skeptical about the version that will be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
