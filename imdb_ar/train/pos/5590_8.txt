(There is no need to summarize the plot, because others have already done so.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find fault in the film, where we feel as excited as the cinematic experience today. Against this backdrop, it seems that a film like Ecstasy has wandered into another planet. I think there are several worthwhile reasons for that. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera slowly revolves over the hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a calm and serene sense of the natural nature of the world that integrates men and women into a fold. These things together reveal a style and dimensions almost completely missing from today's technology-based cinema, where rapid editing tends to shift the audience's attention and focus. In addition, the story is transferred to the eye and not to the ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what is happening. This is far from the current craft fare, where visual images seem to be counted only when they excite audiences. But perhaps the most troubling - the film is sometimes serene, not in the sense that silent films are quiet because we expect them to be. But in the sense that characters rarely speak when we expect them. Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. The first must choose a professional image to convey the narration, while the latter should think about those images, as they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of this is intended to downplay today's film - industry. It is simply to point out that a film like Machaty's comes out of an aesthetic quite different from the one we have today. I do not claim either to be better or worse. However, Ecstasy is claimed to represent a largely lost view of the cinema experience today, as these reflective values ​​are routinely dismissed as slow and tedious. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautiful beer garden scene with the final lift shot rising to reveal the magnificent painting below. The slow pans in the countryside are well expressed with their existential celebration of life, nature and innovation. These are scenes that do not overwhelm you, but instead - quietly available half-chance - quietly accumulating in an unforgettable experience in its own way such as the diversity of the spine "jaws." <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes very heavy, as happens when Machaty is stacked on images, especially in the final sequence that reaches the action. It is difficult to know what this subversive presence can do. The symbolism may be related to the heroic dimension of the hard work of the hero who tends to love and people in general - a subject that is then promoted by influential Soviet cinema. However, its presence here is somewhat exaggerated. <br /> <br /> In any case, I must admit that I initially caught sight of the brilliant Heidi Lamar in the buff. But now I have to admit that in this process, I also got more than just a glimpse of the forest.
