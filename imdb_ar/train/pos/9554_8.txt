Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedy movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood because it lacks the values ​​of "social commentary" required by many of today's films (1969). <br /> <br /> Characters are more than just satire of ordinary people and are played by all actors for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines brightly, like Lord Foppington, with a hair so big that it does not fit the door. <br /> <br /> The plot includes the usual things of the 18th century; false identities, frustrating romances, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn. <br /> <br /> She answers the questions: What happens when there are 4 hungry and eager sailors on vacation in a small British coastal town? Who is involved and how does all this turn out? <br /> <br /> Despite the poor performance of the box office, it has great costumes and excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater of the same musical name), wonderful, vibrant and clearly authentic groups. <br /> <br /> Its release on VHS or DVD is no longer a disgrace, as many bad movies are shown daily.
