"Mouse at Home" is a very classic comics by Tom and Jerry, faithful to their traditions but their own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, very amusing and very entertaining. The artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This is not just about trying Tom to pick up Jerry. Butch lives in the same house trying to catch the mouse too, because "there will be only one cat in this house in the morning - this is the cat who gets the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon. For me, for example, when you see Mammy Two Shoes the two sleeping cats grow up and sarcastically say, "I'm glad you enjoy the nap," and she hopes to be satisfied because she is not satisfied, two moments. Another funny twist is when Tom disguises himself as Mami Toe and criticizes Butch with a fried pot, and then Butch makes Tom himself. Of course, even funnier than this is when the real Mami Toe shoes appear and the two girls think they see each other disguised as Mami and then hit her on the "background" - Laughter. She naturally feels crazy and once she feels crazy, she does not bother her. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he expelled her too.
