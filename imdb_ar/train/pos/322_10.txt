This film is not pornographic, it was not supposed to be pornographic, and unless my uncle ran for the president of the world, he should never be considered a pornographer. <br /> <br /> Now that this problem has been resolved, I can say I highly recommend this movie, where its problems are still widely available. It's funny, great acting and raises serious (weird) questions. <br /> <br /> I can not quite understand why this movie was abused, and that's probably why I'm not planning to visit the United States at all. Lina is the real leader in the riot and modern confusion and confusion and curiosity and intelligence are the main features, they are angry sometimes, but we are not all?
