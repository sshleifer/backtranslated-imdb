First fast "shut up!" For those who say this movie stinks. You can not go to every movie that Citizen Kane expects. This was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only drawback to this film is, I do not think there was enough chemistry between me and Julia Steeles. They should have had more about it. Other than that, the film is a good fun. Salma Blair needs to eat something. She worries me. But it still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for an appointment or fun on a Saturday afternoon. Go and see. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 of ****
