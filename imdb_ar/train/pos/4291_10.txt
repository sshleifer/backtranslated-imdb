From the opening shots of the main actor, an early look is given on how many men's lives are managed by women in them, and the humor that comes through everything that goes on in everyday life. <br /> <br /> Director Eric Lartigo explores how many European men feel they have full control over their lives, but without the help / support of the women around them, things can not seem to work. The use of a facial image throughout the film is great, and his intelligent status for the prominent member of the family (the mother) appears immediately. <br /> <br /> While there are more than enough laughter in the film, it still deals with sole parents / adoption and family power in the community. Really rewarding to watch, and again that the only French seam is able to make. <br /> <br /> So far one of the best 50 or so movies that I have seen this year and deserve a starting rating of five. I look forward to adding this to your DVD collection when it is released and strongly recommend it to all ages.
