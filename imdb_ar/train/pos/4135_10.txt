It's a very charming film, one of my favorite romantic comedy films. It's very funny and the actors are wonderful. Although Lawrence Olivier is often associated with his work from Shakespeare, it appears in this film that he is in no way confined to playing classical theater. He manages to move from a cynical divorce lawyer, who tries to avoid women and their treacherous ways, to the puppy of Lowwick, who falls for Ms. X, played by Merle Oberon without bothering. The dialogue is clever, witty, refreshing and charming. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well. I strongly recommend it.
