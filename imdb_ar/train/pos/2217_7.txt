I usually suspect watching movies or mini-series based on novels because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it would be useful to have a producer and an executive writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> The crew is fantastic. I can not describe how much you enjoyed watching a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Setting up the site ... I was expecting to see the houses and houses I had imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was a bit different. However, it was not enough to make me not like the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: You will not be disappointed if you have done so. 8 of 10 Stars! <br /> <br />
