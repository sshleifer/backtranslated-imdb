I saw the movie with two grown children. Although they were not as smart as a partner, I think they were fairly good. In the film theater surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no voice so I know that all the children love it. There parents also looked engaged. Cause death and apparent death of characters at the right moments and comments. Hopefully people realize that this film is made for children. As such, it was successful although I loved it too. Personally I liked the scrubs !!
