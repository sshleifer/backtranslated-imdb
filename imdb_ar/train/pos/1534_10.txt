I love this show as it is full of adventure, love and intrigue. Well sometimes love! It is very good to watch a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It's very good to play Dick Van Dyke in a television role where I saw him in Mary Poppins only. The combination of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very appealing to the audience. This is an offer you have to watch!
