It is very hard to say what was happening with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the film could have been without studio intervention. Orson Welles's first interest in the film at this stage was to raise money for his play; in fact, funding his projects was what motivated him to look for representative jobs. He made a "lady from Shanghai" for his former wife Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohen was afraid of Rita and stopped the film for a year. <br /> <br /> The plot involves an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Elsie (Hayworth, stunning with short blond hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal lawyer Arthur Panister (Ever Sloan) who paralyzes inside as he is outside. He rents O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a network of murder and deception. <br /> <br /> "The Lady from Shanghai" moves at a fast pace. I agree with one of the posters that criticized films today because it took some time to build a plot. Still, this movie continues. The scene at the Fun House is wonderful - Wells wanted it without music, and I think the studio cut it down. it's a shame. Photography in all parts is stunning, atmospheric, bold and very stylish. <br /> <br /> Wells was an excellent actor, a young man with a personal charm, a great voice and superb technique, but in many films, he almost does not trust himself or take the time to develop a character. Instead, it depends on external factors such as dialects and fake noses. One of the only times he did not do that was "Tomorrow Forever", where the director gets an excellent performance and deep hair. In contrast with the "coercion" where he shows that he is the master of purely technical acting as is the phones in his performance. Here Willis performs a quadriplegic duty - as director, star, co-writer and narrator. The practice of sport was quite unnecessary and a strong look was a quick way to characterize. However, he is always committed. <br /> <br /> Supporting players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, brilliant and smooth (sang by Anita Ellis once again called Anita Ellis) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen existences. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty. <br /> <br /> Any film directed by Orson Welles is worth watching, and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this makes the viewer frustrating, as is the "Ampereks Ambersons" - as does any work done by Willis within the studio system. He was a great artist who should have been given a freer judgment; he was not. It was a strange split - he needed more freedom, but as some of his subsequent works show, he needed the studio structure. Unfortunately, he could not get both.
