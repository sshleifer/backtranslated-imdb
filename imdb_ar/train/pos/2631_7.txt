If The Lion King is a serious story about the little lion who grew up to avenge his father's death, The Lion King is 1 1/2, quite the opposite, full of sleepiness and joy. The lion narrated the king's story by Simba the little lion, 1 and a half from the point of view of Timon and Pumba, which is less than the ideal duo made up of Mirkat who left the house because he could not dig tunnels without burying friends, neighbors and a pig who had an odor problem. The film is a bit short in content, but Disney does a good job filling in the time with various graphics from Timone and Pumbaa while "watching" the movie with us. My favorite is to sing which happens in the middle of the movie, be sure to watch the Bounce Mistakes! Disney announced a one-and-a-half advertisement for the "rest of the story", although it is not. It's just a different perspective for The Lion King, without all the serious things that dominated most of the second half of Disney's original classic. As Nathan Lin as Timoney and Ernie Sabella as Bomba for their vocal work, and without their efforts, the film may not have worked. Sing, enjoy, and laugh at us. They also give us a reason to avoid the hot tub using the beetle.
