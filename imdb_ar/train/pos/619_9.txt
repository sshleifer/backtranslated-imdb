I was expecting this film to be decent and maybe vulgar, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I've never heard of him) played an incredibly good leadership role; he was serious and romantic, and my friend and I who watched the movie with me fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Clare Danis, whom I liked before (I love her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her more. Her behavior was wonderful, and I could not even say she was American. The chemistry between them and Charlie Cox was very good, and the choice was very perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert Dino and Michelle Pfeiffer were well; DeNiro as a gay hacker ... priceless, priceless. I laughed hard in this scene where Septimus comes on board ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played Wicked Decent, I like her as a snippy mom in a hair fixer. But she had an appropriate amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the film. In general, it was funny (but not at all slap!), romantic, the special effects were not quite repetitive but when they were, they were wonderful; the veil of Reiki Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also in good shape. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies such as Princess Bride or Lord of the Rings. I have kept my attention all the time and will buy a DVD when it comes out!
