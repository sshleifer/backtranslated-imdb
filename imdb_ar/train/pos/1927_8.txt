After the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought about this most interesting program, which although it was only short term, had a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout. Not generally visible for more than 40 years, it would be worth watching again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was an extract of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, which is riding the famous rocket sleigh, usually referred to as "the fastest surviving man".
