You are waiting to see if the new version is better or worse. Audie Murphy has been rated 3 (I'm a hardcore student), the second-ever film I've ever given (worst of all, "Battle at Bloody Beach".) If you're curious (give this movie a rating of "8" I am a student in the tough class.) It's a civil war story for dissident "soldiers", if you want to call them, against the North. People like Quantrell, the men who rode with those outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original version was a watercolor, very clean cut, while still terrifying the horror of what these guys did. In fact, movies like the old version are better viewed by mature audiences, which can tell the story. I would be more prepared to evaluate the original "R" and this one, with its harsh nature, is GP, because the newer movie gives a very explicit version, a message that is easily decrypted by an event more than the old version. <br /> <br /> Since the early 1960s, filmmakers have boasted about "realism," but few of them offer. Instead, they only offer awesome sights, awesome costumes, and terrible events, but with stereotyped cardboard characters for the comic book, the weak spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers realized this mistake. It is evident in the superior Western style that we usually see today. This film is an example. It provides realistic settings, but it also gives us personalities we can believe existed in that era. <br /> <br /> It contains a number of calm, making sitting completely difficult during some, and contains some unexplained positions. But the unwarranted positions are fine as long as the entire film continues to hold, and the characters are interesting enough. <br /> <br /> It starts a bit, but it actually gets better. The main character is personal that we can identify, and at least we have some sympathy with it. The Audie Murphy character of the early film has no sympathy, and is a very ingenious character without motivation. <br /> <br /> Trace character in this film lines a real antagonist hero. There is a motive, a way of his madness. We never feel that it is really "true", but we can understand where it came from. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of actions in the movie. There is also some humor. One good sight is when the heroine tells the hero that she will not lie to him and thinks about it. <br /> <br /> This film succeeds in doing what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and writer team got it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Full success.
