Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but unfortunately this is not the only thing he has to do. According to his very wealthy father, Arthur must marry wealthy Susan Johnson or he cut off family money (worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not like Susan (although I hear she makes some good chicken) and she just fell on top of waitress Linda Marola. Arthur is an interesting colleague. He is really a great child, born in riches with at least one person taking care of him every second of every day. The work is to massage Arthur in the wrong way - he likes the fun, feminine, and drink of course. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of complex of Jakele and Hyde. Although that puts him in all kinds of problems, it's funny to see him on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great in this film as Arthur, who won Oscar nomination and won the Golden Globe for his performance. Moore is great with the comedy aspects of the film, turning the already ridiculous lines into unforgettable comic gold, but also wonderful in moving Arthur to a wearable and personal level. Moore has some help in the stars involved - Lisa Minelli is as wonderful as Lena, the energetic character that Arthur can not get enough, and John Gilgod is as wonderful as Butler Arthur Hobson. Gilgod won Best Actor Oscar for his performance in this film, and there is no doubt why. Hobson enjoys a dry, hard, solid pause, but he is always looking for Arthur - and Gilgod is perfect in this role. Arthur's 1981 film by Steve Gordon is short and simple, but he laughs a lot.
