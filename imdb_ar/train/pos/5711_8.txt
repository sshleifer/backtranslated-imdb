In "Le Mémoire", René Clare, one of the greatest film directors and great pioneers, has created a jewel of light comedy, a very light and technically touching film that has influenced subsequent filmmakers such as Marx Brothers, Lubitch and Mammolian. This story, a masterful story of a poor artist who won huge sweepstakes but frantically searches all over the city for lost tickets, is basically a tool to support a series of brilliant comic scenes released in the dream world from the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this film is that, although it is located in the center of Paris and contains nothing that is impossible in reality, it achieves a sustainable atmosphere of imagination / imagination, where it seems very natural that Sing people as much as they talk, or that the dispute about a stolen vest must take the form of a football game. Another unforgettable element is that Le Million includes what might be the most extreme opera ever seen in the movie ("Those Laughing Sopranos!") And the joy is also: Clare has assembled an amazing collection of actors Are all sharply different, each of them accurately illustrating the deadly satanic "French bourgeoisie" of the genre, so that the film looks like a collection of Daumier publications coming to life. <br /> <br /> The suit takes some time to start, Emotionally they can even be in a light comedy (as, for example, in many of the movies of Lubitch.) For these reasons I am grateful But they should not be distracted by an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Do you see this in all the ways? It is highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential motion picture or just a fun comedy.
