Most of the war films produced in the United States during the Second World War were very interesting to watch, but they suffered from serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for propaganda to raise morale at home than anything else. I do not touch these films because many of them are still famous. However, because they often lack realism, they are prevented from being truly wonderful films. A good example of this is John Garfield's Air Force - the B-17 takes half of the Japanese air force on its own! Pride Of The Marines, however, is a welcome visitor - scoring high scores to film a true story in a reasonably accurate way. When I first saw this film, I thought it was not a real story, as it seemed unlikely to be real. However, after further research I found that it was actually fairly true in the amazing story of two men who did much to win the Medal of Honor. This is the case where the real life seemed incredible!
