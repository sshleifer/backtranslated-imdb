First, let me say that "before sunrise", like all movies, is not a film of all tastes. It seems that some people are less intelligent in understanding this fact, but it is remarkable that this kind of explicit hatred is generated by this small and harmless film of some people. For me, like most people here, before the sunrise hit me and a deep hole in me, I was really amazed, I was moved by my inspiration. It is a film that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the unforgettable emotions and emotions you might imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings it has received. <br /> <br /> The film works as a company of two fragile souls who are beginning to recognize each other. It is very intelligent and inspirational, not so much in how a conversation necessarily relates to the next topic or the importance of the Jesse and Sillen discussion topics, but rather the nuances, the obvious responses they raise from each other. It embodies true, romantic, but fleeting, human feelings that began to thrive in Vienna's luxurious environment. It convinces us that their trivial relationship may be the greatest compliment in the world. What happens after that night is open to discussion, but I never doubt that they will not come back to each other again. <br /> <br /> The obvious comments made by RockytheBear and the user described below are hopeless examples of an ideological dissident who is unwilling to accept and respect those who love this film. <br /> <br /> Watch it and it may change your way of life.
