The entertaining vehicle of Jim Belushi, a modern version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caen plays an angel of sorts that allows Billows to see how life would have been "made big." Jim is at his best with a good story and cast support. It looks like the real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar rival but a good warm heart fun.
