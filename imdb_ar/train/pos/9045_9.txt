There are a few trivialities to be noted about an early scene in the film where Homer watches the December 6, 1957 attempt (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) which showed the attempted launch of Vangard, which failed. <br /> <br /> Then read or dictate a letter to Dr. von Brown offering condolences on the failure. <br /> <br /> Vaughn Brown at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville was working for the Army. The Vanguard project was carried out by the early NASA team, which was soon to become Goddard Space Flight Center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed to Jupiter, which was essentially a US-made V2 technology, but launched a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> Homer may have already made this mistake because of the reputation of von Braun, but his team did not fail in his attempt. In fact, Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first booster aircraft with an American rating, used for the Shepherd orbital flight, in addition to Grisom. <br /> <br /> This is why this kind of movie is very good, hopefully we will inspire people to read these parts of trivia and identify them, in this process learn what has been accomplished and be inspired to do more.
