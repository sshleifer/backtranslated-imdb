"Erendira" Amazing and wonderful with its magical realism. The film "Erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude." Erendera constantly dreams and accidentally burns her grandmother's house house. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forced her into prostitution to pay for the damage. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the subject seems harsh, the film does not take advantage of sexual activity. This is done in a mature artistic way. The film also contains some amazing costumes. Among the more surreal aspects of the film are more highlights, origami birds that turn into real birds, and golden orange with diamonds in the middle.
