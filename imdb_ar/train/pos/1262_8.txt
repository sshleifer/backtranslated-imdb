A promising young college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is being sent to jail for killing a innocent young girl and is in progress. Sean Connery plays the role of a "happy-luck" lawyer, who is stalked by the young man's retirement and begging to take over the case in the hope of releasing her grandson. Lawrence Fishburne plays the role of a police officer who was well involved in the case and is determined to expose the theory that Conrey may be digging to try to free the boy who and the whole police department have committed the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Cabshaw, Robbie De, and Ar Lynn Theben participated in this dramatic drama.
