The film begins with something less like a dead, dead or dead motor: strange activities are performed underground while police officers discover their bodies. But when a police officer is killed, someone gets involved in Tatsuhito ... and when he discovers that his brother, Shihito, is also involved, things become very fast. <br /> <br /> Miike's Shinjuku Triad Society's previous work is still full of its usual habits of violence by the Brotherhood and Sadism, although it is not one of the most selective or inflammatory pieces. Instead, it is a fantastic collection of pulp fiction, while Tatsuhito digs his way underground, a labyrinth leading to the triad leader of homosexuals selling illegal bodybuilders from Taiwan and maintaining a brothel almost of young boys. Especially the character that kills the policeman at first). Tatsuhito's brother is involved in the community, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and uses similar violent and sad methods to penetrate into this dark world. <br /> <br /> What is interesting in this little work is the relationship of Tatsuhito with his opponent, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, who later returned to Japan and was isolated from it. Wang is a Chinese foreigner in China, killing his father and developing a wing of crime in Japan. Wang is also an amazingly Shakespearean personality, and he's strange enough, and even less you start to feel sorry for him while his final encounter with Tatsuhito comes. The same Tatsuhito is a similarly tragic figure when forced to face his lack of ability to control his brother. Although it is illogical to say that Miike's films are mostly successful in terms of shock value, it is sometimes easy to track the extent of Miike's ability to create bitter and unenthusiastic characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
