If not in the whole film, Andy Griffith once again plays his best role in this CBS television movie. The plot is the death of an easy figure for Griffith and his hope is that his wife and children are scattering his ashes as he called it (Mountains somewhere). Although it will never be shown on the TV and will never be shown on the video, if you have the opportunity to see it - take it.
