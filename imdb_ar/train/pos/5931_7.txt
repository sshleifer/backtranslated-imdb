Although written by Stephen King, an overstated writer if there is one, it is actually a fun B movie. The vampire creature, the incestuous creatures that live in a house lit by candles and draining the life force of the virgins, great scene of the cemetery, heroic cats and very virgin. The soundtrack contains Enya music, an idea that I found beautiful ... I'm sure King is disappointed with this little film, although he had a crazy dialogue and ideas, all from a real potting pot. (Although the Sleepwalkers, if understood correctly, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). However, those touches of sewer odors show that the ghost writer is not used after all ...
