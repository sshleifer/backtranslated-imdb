It's a very silly film. It starts with a soft pornographic sequence, and he ventures into a strange comedy at the art gallery. He adds a shock of discovery in the hotel room and then offers random murder for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The following is a strange and surreal (the stopwatch scene in particular is superfluously unnecessary), culminating in the "evolution" of the end of the revelation which is as evidently unfair to the viewer (see the trivia section on the face) The determination of why it is deliberately unfair). The film is about insulting as many groups as possible - transgender, insane, stereotyped, stereotypical stereotypes - on the metro - and treating the viewer with an outspoken outspokenness in the closing scenes, where the characters explain endlessly to each other Some have great details, over and over again what just happened in the film. Although the female characters in the restaurant scene in the end are fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is fun to watch: despite many many flaws, the whole package just, well, works.
