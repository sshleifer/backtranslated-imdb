There is not much in this story - only two men use very different ways to deal with the memories of Vietnam. But what is lacking in the hypothesis is more than compensation in realism and realism. It is a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and common experience. So we get romance (unwarranted - just another very real piece of this story). It's worth watching.
