Based on a true story of how a man before his time - the great American poet Walt Whitman - made a big contribution to how Western medicine deals with people with psychological problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with psychological problems, he began to connect with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of time (inhumane methods and harsh cruelty), Walt rejected these methods, treating patients with compassion and dignity, and encouraged others to do the same. The story of interactions with psychiatrists, patients and urban dwellers is full of drama, humor and wisdom. :)
