I did not expect Val Kilmer to make John Holmes convincing, but I found myself forgetting that he was not the pornographic legend himself. In fact, the entire actors played an outstanding role in this highly undervalued film. <br /> <br /> As some have already said, look for a collection of two discs and watch the documentary "Wadd" first; it will give you a lot of background information about the story that will be useful in estimating the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem dissatisfied with the LAPD crime scene video that is included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that may be listed, one of which is that John Holmes' murder trial was the first in the United States where the prosecution used the footage. If you do not want to see it, it is easy to avoid; it has been clearly identified as "LAPD crime scene footage" in the list!
