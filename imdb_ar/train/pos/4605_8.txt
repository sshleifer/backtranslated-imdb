This is not one of Jackie Chan's greatest films, but it is also one of the greatest Kung Fu films of all time. <br /> <br /> We've anticipated amazing, exciting, dynamic and innovative works in Chan Movies, and this one set the standard for others to follow. It's two hours of exclusive entertainment, which is impressive all the time. <br /> <br /> In addition to great work, we have a viable story and believable personalities, with Chan taking what seems to be a more Western approach to writing, mixing eastern precision ways (ie kicking ass). <br /> <br /> In general, it's funny, serious, armed and pioneering. Any Kung Fu fan must, while at the same time accessible to the audience of the film community.
