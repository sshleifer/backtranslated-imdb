When I found this movie in my video shop, I was expecting another cheesy American vampire movie in the same context as "The Lost Boys" (1987). To the surprise "To Die for" really good film. It is a very small film. A bit cumbersome at times, but there are still enough elegant sets and surprises to satisfy vampire lovers. This is the perfect combination of romance and horror and it is sometimes surprising. strongly recommended.
