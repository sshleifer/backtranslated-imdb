This film brings back many of the old classic cinema memories, as actors did not have to take off their clothes to make the audience watch their film. <br /> <br /> First, I think the main point of this film is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely the film industry. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of comments regarding the movie Sweet and Sickness of Mind. In response, I think this is a fairly correct analysis, but considering that it is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been significantly reduced. HSSH could not be seen in some places. <br /> <br /> But in this film, when the emotional moments come, you find yourself smiling, wishing the novice couples all the best and hoping that nothing bad will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another important point is the performance of Shahid and Amrita. They both behaved very well, especially Shahid who looks great in the film. Amrita seems simply stunning and must be taken seriously as a major star in the future. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole, I feel it was very long. It was possible to cut off some of the center and may have a greater impact. I also think that music, although it is compatible with the film when you see that the positions a bit old and could have benefited the film in the case of more modern soundtrack. Although the songs of Muji Haq and Hamri Shadi Men are wonderful. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely recommend this romantic film, it looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I will not go into details, only if you do not see it. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are prone to crying, Take wipes!
