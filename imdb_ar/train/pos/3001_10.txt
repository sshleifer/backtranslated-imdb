Good yarn cracking with all the actors give great value. Michael Kurtz at his best. Lots of great twists and turns and probably the best in the Philo Vance series. William Powell seems to be wonderfully relaxed and at his best. Pioneer for thin man series. Recommend to everyone. Is the whole number?
