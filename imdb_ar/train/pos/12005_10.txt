It was the best film I've ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this film because you are able to feel more about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a wonderful and changing film for life that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I have watched this film with my family and I can testify that we all have changed the heart. This film allows people to understand how difficult the life is for the Prophet and the extent of his ordeal. After I saw this film, there was no dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was affected by what they saw and I have not been the same since I saw him. I highly recommend this film to everyone.
