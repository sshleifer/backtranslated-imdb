If you love plot twists, this is your movie. It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next. Nothing seems or ends as you think. The characters are all brave and attractive. Crate at its best. Dennis Hopper once again shows his evil side. GT Walsh is perfect in his recent performance. Laura Boyle Sizzling. Dwight Yoakum makes the film for the first time in a great way in the inscription. I label this film as "I'm having a really bad day". Not a slow minute in this film. A real sleeper. This film is taken lightly, and unfortunately, it is ignored.
