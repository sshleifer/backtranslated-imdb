For Troma lovers or Cyberpunk type mixed with a little blood shedding this movie for you! There is a large amount of blood that is thrown within the boundaries of this film, as the effects can be wonderful and terrible. This plot is ridiculous and refreshing, and it is not restricted to what we expect from an audience of films these days. All in all, it's a good movie for lovers of this genre. We also recommend movies like Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for this strange Japanese film approach, full of wonderful mystery and bloodshed. Of course, when you watch this movie, you must have knowledge of both.
