Faye Grimm is the continuation of a story that began ten years ago with Henry Bean Hartley. I have not seen the previous film, and I do not know whether this is a good thing or not. I can only consider the current film with its own advantages. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hall Hartley's style of making movies is something you love or dislike. His combination of action, drama, humor, humor, and irony resonates with me, and Faye Grimm is no exception. It contains an atmosphere of clever, sharply written parody that has made me and a lot of the audience at the Melbourne International Film Festival laugh loudly. During the first half of the film he was relentlessly handed over to a dead end. It is a method of humor that unfortunately lacks the cinemas and a welcome comedy of the courageous teen that Hollywood pumps like pancakes. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the film, humor began to recede when the film became an international spy / plot. Whether this is Hartley's intention or whether the ideas run out is unclear, but I think some editing or rewriting to reduce the duration of the film for 15 minutes would have kept the momentum of the original film. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, especially Parker Busy and Jeff Goldblum, who spent most of the screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played good supporting roles. The film was fantastic (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (by Hartley) was also good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it a lot. If you like the previous Hartley works, you might like this.
