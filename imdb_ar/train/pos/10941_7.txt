Sarah Silverman thought about showing her own program, she was worrying me at first. The films she appeared in were not very funny and a little humor in them. However, I was very surprised by her real vision shining in the Central Comedy Jewel. I can put it on par with the likes of Amy Sidares in "Strangers with Candy" - Sarah's character is a real social scientist, comparable to the character of Cedarys Jerry Planck. Support Body. The character of her sister is good; sometimes funny, but in the end means not stealing a pleasant presentation. However, the rest of the representatives are very unequal compared. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad that Comedy Central has given Sarah an opportunity to show her unique and crazy sense of humor and self.
