This series, probably produced at the most appropriate time for the events of the Second World War, is a wide range of values ​​that stand above anyone's presumption of criticism. <br /> <br /> The timing of world production in the war in 1974, nearly three decades after the events of the war, allows for an accurate link to the events in a way that is not crowned by the remaining propaganda. Thirty years can be said to be supported by an impressive array of individuals, from some of the highest military and political figures to field soldiers, civilians and death camp survivors, to witness the unimaginable inhumanity that civilized humans can achieve. Most people interviewed or close to their senior years had enough time to think about their experiences, and in most cases they had enough time for any publicity and enthusiasm that had affected them in the past had receded, leaving only the memories they had seen And what they did. <br /> <br /> The information provided by these survivors, remarkably enhanced by the attitudes and expressions they offer while telling them about their roles, gives their stories a greater impact. Names such as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer and Gertrude Junge ... The list is too long. <br /> <br /> Today, during the lives of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, they are young people chanting the same kind of promotion of military and national war as it led to World War II. The series of DVDs we discuss here should include the substance of mandatory history in schools, so that the lessons you have learned should not be wasted on this terrible cost in those days, but those who have not seen directly a terrible price should be taken. <br /> <br /> I've almost finished watching Disk Set 11, after watching most of the series when it was broadcast by a local TV channel more than 10 years ago. I have not lost any of its importance; it has in fact become more than a wonderful history for the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating does not seem to apply to this presentation. I think the value of this string goes beyond counting.
