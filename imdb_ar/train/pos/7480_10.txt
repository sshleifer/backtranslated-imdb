This film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. Captures the imagination of the masses through his role as David Iames. His character can contact us all in some way. The story line is highly intelligent and keeps the public on standby throughout the entire film. I have never seen Cruise movies very much before, but after I saw this he shows me his true talent. My favorite part of the film is the end, where it all came to a great conclusion and I discovered the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely try it. It's one of those movies that I started watching as soon as I saw it to the end or it made you think and regret it. My opinion is that you just have to buy it and take a risk that's what I did and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise you once you see it, it will stick to you and you'll love it forever.
