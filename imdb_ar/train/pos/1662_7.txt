Artemisia can be considered a treason or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> What can you tell on average? <br /> <br /> In authenticated history, Artemisia Gentile has been exposed to the thumb, and continues to assert that she, like Mary Garard and Gloria, has been eloquently confirmed by Stein. <br /> <br /> In the film, under various tortures, she refused to condemn her lover / violator. <br /> <br /> How can the film deviate a lot from the date received, yet are you still aware of the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not hard to find. In the film, the director and actors made a big gap in the historical record, with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a different conclusion from the record. <br /> <br /> Let it be. I find _both_ the record and the film convincing. <br /> <br /> In both film and (looks) in history, Artemisia was a painter, above all else. <br /> <br /> For that vision, framed by a magical film, I am truly grateful. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a film forcing my eyes on it. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
