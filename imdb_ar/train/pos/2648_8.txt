Truly a tale of two arrogant brothers and their respective fall of grace (through drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, a genius announced by James Franco, is your sensitive but intelligent man. The other brother is the doctor of the future who works hard and becomes less appreciative because he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the pressures of living according to his family's expectations for both children. Is not too heavy because drug superstitions want to be so, all in a largely realistic form of family dynamics caused by drug problems. I recommend it to anyone interested in such personal studies and I commend James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a love act.
