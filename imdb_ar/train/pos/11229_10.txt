With the number of representatives who worked on the project have a wide range of representatives. Nice CGI spacecraft in places but its green screen needs some work. Anyone who hears about Adobe After Effects 7, should buy it to have a better key. <br /> <br /> The stories are well thought out and a lot of the elements of the trip are in order to keep them in the right context. But the idea of ​​kissing players makes me wear the loop. I'm not gay but I can not help guys kissing amusing (I do not mind women). Anyway ... for the fan series, these are good things. With a slight improvement in its green screen, the representation and some of the steering ratings saved this amazing series. Anyway, I would recommend this series to from I enjoyed both TNG and DS9.
