This is really a wonderful movie. Some of the songs of timeless classics and dance by Fred and Ginger have become among the best songs ever. But basically, all the films are unique and Ginger are the same. After singing and dancing, the other characters in the film are making the film work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His relationship with Harriet Hilliard and the sub-plot of the film is why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this film, he does not detract from it. He has a winning personality and a wonderful smile. Randy's top ten favorites. It's great to see it as something other than a cowboy. Well, he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, mature Victor, and so on. All Fred and Ginger films contain sub-charts based on other actors to fill the gap between musical numbers, otherwise the movie must be shortened by about half an hour. I wish more people would appreciate Randy and felt the need to defend him.
