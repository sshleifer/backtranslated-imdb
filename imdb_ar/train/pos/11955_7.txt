Allow yourself to be transferred to a different kind of old school story. Scoop is a classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's latest inspiration, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared last year at Match Point, by Allen), is amazingly able to reduce her kitten's appeal to violent sex and turn her into a natural looking kind of student with glasses Nerdish clothes but they still fail to make the audience believe how true that heavenly Hugh Jackman figure can laugh at them severely, given the background of the property (do not worry, no spoilers here). There are no major shifts to Johansson's character here, as she constantly plays the same character despite writing the script in another way. You even forgive the apparent lack of her region to someone, and continue to have an affair with a suspected serial killer, simply because he is His Royal Majesty Hotness Jackman, who rejuvenates to see no wolves and wolves. <br /> <br /> It's about 70-year-old Allen. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way he always has; as if he has never been exposed to modern filmmaking, which is probably what makes his quiet and simple films attractive. It does not seem to be aimed at a particular market; it is as if Allen makes films with his own taste, whether the audience likes them or not.
