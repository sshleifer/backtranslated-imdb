I made my first comment on this film about five years ago. After that, the ideas presented in the film were still mostly fantastical, if they could turn out at all. Not anymore. Now, politics, society and the media in The Running Man seem very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were absent in 1987 (the year in which Run Man came out) present today: <br /> <br /> Anxiety, as Richard Dawson's character Dimon Kilian described it, Traditional ". See <br /> <br /> Entertainment in extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort on the part of the contestants. Check out <br /> <br /> cameras are everywhere. Check <br /> <br /> Travel restricted to citizens in the fancy of the government, controlled by the central computer system complete with encrypted passports ("tickets" in the film) and punishable under the guise of national security. Check <br /> <br /> Increased mixing, on the border with incest, of the government and the media. See <br /> <br /> computer-generated graphics developed enough to handle real movie footage (such as "Digital Mat" for Ben Richards' image on a double trick). See <br /> <br /> Sentenced conscientious objectors or detractors from the current administration. See: <br /> <br /> The stagnant economy widens the gap between rich and non-wealthy; increasing numbers of marginal groups interact with the big government's tightening; civil unrest brews under or on the surface of almost every major public event regardless of its origin or intention. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Then again, it may be just a film based on Stephen King's novel. But just to be safe, I'll move to Switzerland.
