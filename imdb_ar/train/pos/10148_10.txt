I had given this movie a few stars, because it was simply a "life-long" show that was actually filmed at the site represented by the story - here, New York City. Most are filmed on this channel, whether they are "tuned" there, or in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia or Los Angeles etc., in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian regions. <br /> <br /> But if there is ever one that deserves the highest rating - 10 * on this site, this is the movie. Certainly not for originality, this story has been accomplished several times, in many variations, with many quite similar to this specific one. It is also often done on the big screen, with huge stars, past and present, from Carrie Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al., Deborah Kerr, Doris Daye, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 people, just as it is prominent, from past to present, from the top of my head, which can be added now, and perhaps there are many other people who can be taken into consideration. <br /> Not on drones, but my point is, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best kind that I have seen. I caught it by chance in the middle of Friday, at a time when I had only the TV because I was taking a few hours after a very hectic week. I have never run through this fire in 8 years since I made it. Although potential clients did enough to be known to most, they were not known to me. The only actors I knew were Felice Newman (Anna's mother) whom I had seen in some things since her youth, and Michael Respoley (Henry, Charlie's favorite friend), who was prominent as "Gramma". <br /> <br /> The opportunity to meet and connect the best friends of both groups, as a sub-story friendship, with their association with Anne and Charlie, which were only revealed later, is much of the work. Type, but there is no difference between pleasure here (in fact, it enhances it). <br /> <br /> When reviewing some other comments, I fully agree with the most positive comments. The key word that describes this film is "indulgences", in hats. This characterization describes performers; personalities; chemistry between and among all characters, in any combination made, and all supportive and even secondary roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with the "Hardest Edge:" "Rounders;" Survivor Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfiles;" even classics like "Casablanca", "Gone with the Wind", "Citizen Ken". But to enjoy the exclusive and uncomplicated, this place was wonderful. With a small portion of their budgets, was equal to the results achieved by "You You Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle". Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have been better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the participating stars and support staff here were equivalent to those in these mega-movies as well.
