For anyone who wants to get an impression of the Soviet vision of modern Russian history, this huge film is a treasure. The story begins at the end of the century (1900) in dark brown colors of old pictures that improve to black and white during the middle of the century and even full color when the story approaches the modern era (ie the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, characterized by the arrival and arrest of anarchist during the cesarean period. He later joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communism to his village. His son, through local beauty, fights the Germans during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry starts and deals with some of the Soviet economic ideals. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but it is perfectly logical and very well made. It can be seen in three parts.
