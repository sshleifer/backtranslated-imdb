Winchester '73 is a wonderful story, and that's what I like about it. It is not your daily gorge - it uses a gun, which moves hands from different personalities - as a mechanism to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays the role of an Indian captain, and Jimmy Stewart plays the role of a leading, heart-wrenching and powerful man. Shelley Winters plays a role in confronting the realities of her husband and the wild West. It is important to note those politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this film without remorse. According to today's standards, it is still very violent. It's a great story to watch. Enjoy!
