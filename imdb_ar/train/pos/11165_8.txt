She speaks four words about why the film was made - "I did this mistake." The massive commercial success of the Maywest Copper Studio convinced that Melodramat Gay in the 1990s was a viable idea. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written adventure that accurately targets the characters of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Berry and George Raft are excellent as friendly competitors.
