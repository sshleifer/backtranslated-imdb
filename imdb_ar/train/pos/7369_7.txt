Personally I could not get into "This is not a love song", it is a wonderful movie and there is a wonderful story of it. I found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, since there is a close relationship that depends on each other for life. At the same time I hope the relationship is more than it is. Hyton is in love with Spike, but Spike Ibsen is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. Acts of treason, on both sides, have a great influence on both men. Both were destroyed by the fact that the other had fled and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
