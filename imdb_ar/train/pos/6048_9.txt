What a little class of British cinema! It's about time. In addition to a comedy to break it off! <br /> <br /> Anyone looking to regain some of the freedom from his miserable youth will prove the movie path of this card. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of "Withnail" and "I" and "Easy Rider." The film works at a strong pace and does not allow you to drift for a long time ... Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters portrayed by the actors. I was a bit interested in Phil Daniels at first, but luckily, half way was won in the most fun of the whole movie! Overall, I found myself laughing through the film most likely disturbing some people around me. Well, <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. This will become a British comedy of worship. Worth a visit.
