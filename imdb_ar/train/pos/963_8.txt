Takashi Miki is one of my favorite directors, and I was worried about making a film for the kids, because I hate to see him moving away from his favorite movies: visitor Kyo, Gozo, Iso, the killer, and a trio. In recent times he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he succeeds. This is still his first film that I have seen take it in this direction, so I was nervous. From the coarse I bought it without seeing it and I was happy because I did it. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for kids and adults should like it too. The whole movie reminded me of many of the films I loved as a child: a never ending story, a maze, a return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those films because they did not treat children like stupid and this film either. The ethics behind the darkness exist, but, it's also silly like any children's movie. Personally I was not bothered by CGI and prosthetics. I feel that they are well fit and do not think that children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this. But, I suggest giving her a chance. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I thought it was. He continues to produce his own Miike movies outside of these films, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those new people on Takashi Miike who want something light or sexy like this, I suggest this from other Miike movies: Zebraman, Happiness Katakuris, Sabu, The Bird People in China, . <br /> <br /> Takashi Miike's good work! 8/10 Stars.
