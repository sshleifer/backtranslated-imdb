Another in it does not make m such a class. This story is still a family with some real skeletons in her wardrobe eligible for good cleanliness, and sometimes more fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone at their peak as troubled Hadley brothers, took the roles and ran with them. Malone won the Oscars and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, where both honors were honored. It's a fairly nice balancing act. Bacall and Hudson can not be called bad actors, but they have better parts and played them more convincingly than they do here. It's very hard for me to accept Rock Hudson to play the opposite sex with blood as he does here, but that's more than personal bias than anything else. But this is not far from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is great and this film is highly viewable. If I wake up some nights and come to this movie I said I saw him. It's well worth it.
