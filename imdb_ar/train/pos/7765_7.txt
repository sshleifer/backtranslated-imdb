Douglas Cirque directs this over-dramatized drama about the unhappy rich. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are children's friends with a different outlook on life. Kyle is the feminine son of the oil giant. Mitch works for Hadley Oil. They both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore, but Kyle has the means to dazzle her feet. Sister Marley (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the town's town-town and the Mitch torch, which always seems to be cleaning Hadley's mess. His ambition is slightly higher, but the stars make him a film to watch. I was more impressed with Malone. Rounding out actors: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Leerch and Robert J. Wilk.
