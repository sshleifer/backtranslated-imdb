It has been almost 5 years since the release of this elegant film. I have watched this movie almost 10 times and it is a great effort by Gautham. From my point of view, I feel that this film is almost flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - No doubt .. Classy.Jyothika played its role as a maya very well. Personal fits very well. The personal that attracted the attention of filmgoers was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. Wildly and fearfully Jeevan won the Best Villain Award at ITFA 2004. Actor Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> A lively script, quite timed dialogues and a wonderful novel by director Gautham. Harris Jeyaraj are all bashing charts while BGM fits the film very well. The business photography of RD Rajasekhar goes. Peter Hein designed the stunts well. More importantly, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with the right doses of motion and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies are not able to compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
