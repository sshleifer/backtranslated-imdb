There are several factors that make it easy for me to recall that I still believe that this is the most important science fiction film ever produced, despite some representative and outdated dialogue and so forth. <br /> <br /> First, there is a measure of imagination in the description of Krell, a human race domiciled by humans on the planet, all now dead, who were more advanced by a million years of human beings (us), their technique, Especially the 8000-cubic-mile machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there are sound effects and music that can not be separated from one another. It creates a strange feeling, unlike "2001", which contained classical classical music. <br /> <br /> Third, the "monster" is not the strongest and most lethal at all; it also depends on true science and does not violate the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and more importantly, the film Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made, and incredibly successful in making an honest and clever film mercilessly. A logical statement about the limits or ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity), regardless of how long we live as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, he expects our inevitable fate.
