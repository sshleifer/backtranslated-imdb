Personally, I enjoyed cutting it accurately. This was the first time I saw an Australian flick. The genre is usually restricted in mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the usual comedy and drama coming out of Australia, I loved being able to see a local horror film that was not a freak in anything. I did not think it was already a parody of other films. It was supernaturally terrifying like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what I did last summer, so there was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it is time to try Australian films to enter mainstream species. <br /> <br /> The film cut was original and scary enough and in the end it was just fun. I will give him seven out of ten and I will not treat him as something serious. I did what I expected to do, and scared me and scared me enough times to be satisfied. I enjoyed it.
