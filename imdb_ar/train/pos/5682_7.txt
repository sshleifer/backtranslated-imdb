The film has the character of "who he is" supporting players: Josh Lucas, Dylan McDermott as Hollywood countryside, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes's life, and Eric Bogusian as a leader in Tins Town. These characters play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the murders in Wonderland.
