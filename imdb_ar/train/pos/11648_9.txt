There are people who claim that this is another Mexican "violent violence" film. They are right, but more than this film is an invitation to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth hurts you or tired when you have already accepted the model of living in the Third World as the only possible goal. One of the most important things in "Cero y van cuatro" is the open call for deep reflection on our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how Mexican society was spoiled when the Talawak episode appeared. I still do not understand viewers who witness mass murder. I almost died when I saw some pictures. Irak or Rwanda was not just a small village near Mexico City when the frenzy was unleashed with tolerance for the media and the government. I was shocked by the similar situation in this film. Other stories were good portraying other instances of corruption, betrayal, trust, betrayal and violence, but I consider "Tamales de Chivo" the best, <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some "cabrun" and "pendejo" yelling. These are meaningless compared to the actions of people. With a few exceptions, are all perfect examples of human waste. As in real life, the Secretariat has become the exception rather than the norm in our country. Moreover, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
