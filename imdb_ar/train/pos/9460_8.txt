I liked the story somewhere, one poster said that there are no families like the ones filmed in this film. Well maybe there should be. I thought everyone really looked like a man and a friend. What casts first class. What a wonderful music on soundtracks. What a nice thing, it is nice in that, but most of all, I will say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> I really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. It was as real as a widow who devoted himself perhaps to being a good father first, at the expense of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Was he acting like he was recently? Why, yes he did. <br /> <br /> You will see, this is what was ideal in this film. The actor who played this character made me believe that he felt something, not just acting as if he was feeling something, and he conveyed to me exactly what he felt, and what he felt was rejected. <br /> <br /> He denied happiness. <br /> <br /> Denied fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Denied love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is a pain beyond imagination, and many who do it will never feel like that again. <br /> <br /> A beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten.
