Indian cinema classifies cops from two broad categories: either being of the kind or the bad guys. The sincere people are always screaming at the top of their voices and fighting the regime, while the bad policemen often have bad luck but end up suffering. <br /> <br /> This film at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of the police and their lives. The trend takes an inside look at the life of an ambitious young cop. Music is interesting and editing is a trendsetter as far as Indian cinema goes. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes slow and the dilemma faced by Anbu when it comes to Maya sometimes overpriced. But I still give this 9/10 simply because it contains many primitives for its account.
