10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am currently a British Indian doctor in India. Beckham took me out of the word "I'm very impressed with Liverpool, and I personally think Owen is really great." Since Liverpool and Manchester United are contenders, I was sure I would not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some Friends, I had an early flight in the morning, so I thought, "What the heck, let's give time by watching this movie," because that was a late-night show. <br /> <br /> What a fool. I think that using Beckham's name is to attract public attention (which had a backlash in my case !!!), but then I can not think of a better title for the film. <br /> <br /> Nagra, Knightley (dropped a great dead), and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football and Manchester United (or England for that matter) I am only 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but I am a child in the heart.This movie has produced "Star Wars" from my first position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly there are not many comments on this film by British Indians Like me. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
