Someone who mastered the difficult task of integrating sport with romance. In fact, sports are intertwined with romance such as oil and water. So, to put the two together on the screen successfully ... Well, this is equivalent to split the corn. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I generally do not like romantic comedy ... but I love sports and most movies about sports. This film was a very good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I can really appreciate the ordeal of comedy where Ben Rytman (Jimmy Fallon) was a crazy Boston Redsocks fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of Babe that has plagued the Redsox game for 86 years, and they know exactly how attractive the baseball team of Redsox lovers is. The Farley brothers did a great job of capturing it and making the film a good comedy. This film was very good and could attract many.
