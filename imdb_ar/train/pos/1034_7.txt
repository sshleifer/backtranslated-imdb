I think this film may have been much stronger when it first appeared in 1943, although at present it seems so great and so immutable that it can not be elevated to greatness. The film was set in 1940 - before the United States entered the war directly. Paul Lucas plays the head of his family very hard and generous. He is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding arrest. The House of Davis is his wife, whose understanding and long-suffering she has been able to educate and raise children without him from time to time. When the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the United States and for the first time in years, they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was also very ideal and decent - making it look like a clear positive advertisement instead of a real family with real problems. Although this had a noble purpose at the time, it seems to be a liar today. In particular, the incredibly strange and misunderstood dialogue that the children used did not resonate. It was more like anti-fascist rhetoric than real children's voices. As a result they were very annoying - especially the youngest ones who came out, sometimes, as a value. About the only person who seemed real was the house of Davis and her extended American family as well as the Romanian Roman who lived with them (although he did not have a clear tone). <br /> <br /> It is really hard to believe that the radical Daschle Hammet wrote this famous dialogue, because it does not seem true in life. The story was based on the play by his mistress, Lillian Hellman. The idea of ​​a basic story and painting is good, but dialogue is sometimes bad. Overall, an interesting masterpiece and a movie with some excellent moments, ... but that is really all about it.
