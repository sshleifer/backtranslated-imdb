OK Clara Bow's silent film of 1927, is a secondary film from Rain, where Bow plays the role of half-Hawaiian daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the firm English engineer - Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his interest, but both women get a big surprise when his wife (Patricia Dupont) appears. The predatory wife is ready to divorce until she discovers that he may be on the brink of luck. Bow adjusts the fragmentation of her fast. <br /> <br /> Bow has a character to enjoy from some wonderful scenes: her inaugural nude bath, Hula around in a grass skirt, and a dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is wrong. The credits of the film (from my DVD) include Patricia DuPont in the role of Ms. Haldane --- and not Margaret Troix as contained in IMDb.
