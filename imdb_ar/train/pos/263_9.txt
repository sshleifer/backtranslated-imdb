Poirot / Suchet's choice was strong for television obscurity. The characters were alive and well behaved. The plot and the main setting - Student Inn - were excellent. Japp was something special but for me did not distract attention from the story. One important point, many Poirot monitors do not recognize good representation or good characterization. I also think they are somewhat deficient in their judgments on some Poirot secrets. Finally, I have read some of Christie's novels - nothing in recent years - and I find them disturbing because many viewers are angry at the changes in the novel. Please, viewers, keep in mind what is presented to you in the film, not what you think should be there. However, Poirot's secrets differ in quality, but not as much as the reviewers and residents you think. With the exception of The Five Little Pigs, which were fantastic in plot, character and theme, the longer Poirot films are not good or bad. For the record, I saw all the longest Poirot / Suchet movies. Finally, movies that do not contain Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are not good or bad because of their absence. However, the presence is either disgusting (always with Japp) or unrelated to the Hastings. Lemon in the middle.
