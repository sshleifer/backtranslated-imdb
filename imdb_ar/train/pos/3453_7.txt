Although this film contains a first class list of great actors, excellent special effects, and a story line full of surprises, it was not picked up to distribute the studio and went straight to the DVD. It may contain a lot of "anti-police force" information, or it may be a very large number of workflows released during an abundance, but whatever the reason for the loss of large screens the opportunity, fortunately, the new concept of direct release to DVD allows Us to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The feature is old: the rookie reveals a reporter from an inner circle of corrupt police - in this case, FRAT Team (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of well-trained police were created to clean the legendary city of Edison from Low crime point, drugs, prostitution, etc. Working under the guise of the temptation to sell confiscated goods and seized opportunity Now, 15 years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for killing, drug trafficking, innocent terror and so on. The leading dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes horrifyingly real bands!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL) Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving that he can be a sensitive actor). Journalist Paulack (Justin Timberlake) realized "a bad mistake" and told his theory of fraud and corruption to the president of his newspaper Ashford (Morgan Freeman is always good). Gradually, Ashford Ashford and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, who is also a consistently high-profile actor) convince Pollack in this report. The closer we get to Pollack, the more surprises and bad events occur and the story unfolds in a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks charisma that takes the lead, especially in the company of such seasoned actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the blended machine well for a film that runs to the end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's a film that makes the edge of the seat movement flow in a message. Grady harp
