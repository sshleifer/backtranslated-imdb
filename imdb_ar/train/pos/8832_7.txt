"Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Marianna (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American film star), and four young men, Glenn, Sasha, Kecha and Bob, all of them from 15 to 17 in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia . The five are committed and crazy friends of jazz, blue jeans, or anything American seems to be. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship between adolescents is impressive, and ultimately sacrifices are made willingly to try to help one group that has experienced unexpected difficulties. Following the change of communist policy, they went their own ways and reunited in 1985 (the year before the film was produced). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Translations of one thing were difficult. Especially at first, there have been a number of dialogues that have no subtitles at all. The speed of the conversation may have required this, but I was not always able to read the text and understand the scene, which made me not always understand the personality in which it was involved. I saw the film (video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us truly understood part of the story about getting streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This "Yugoslavian Coming" has been moved with the youthful feeling of weakness, idealism, and strong ties that are loyal to one another. There is something very important, and it was interesting, keeping me guessing to the end about who these characters were in the face of the cast in 1953, and what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would like to make it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films directed by Jovan Asin (1941-1991).
