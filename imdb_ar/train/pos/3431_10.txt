Simply the best Estonian film I have ever seen, although directed by Finnish director Ilka Yarvi Lattori. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a group of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. At the same time, however, this is a summary of the circumstances of many Eastern European countries at the time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell into disarray and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions may be better in most of those countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new countries had to fight corruption and organized crime left behind by the Soviet era as an inheritance. (And many are still doing ... at least at some levels ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and a well written text. The actors are very good, especially Gori Garvitt (probably the best known Estonian actor, playing Snoot's role in Tarkovsky Solaris), playing with the old gangs who are slowly fed up with his way of life. But the most surprising performance comes from Monica Mager, a child actor who plays Terry, a teenage girl whose existence in the plot is absolutely necessary. (Not even named in IMDb-credit !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that can be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pemidos does it. Unfortunately, the other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievement. His first song, Kotia päin, was highly artificial and the latest, "History Made Made Night" was just a weird mess.
