The performance was good, I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, who I liked in previous films. The movie was a wonderful family film, nothing that would make you worry to show it to young children, a good story series, lots of laughs, stimulant and fun. If you want to entertain children without being bored to tear it fits your bill. Baby satisfies, not difficult for a parent to watch it, too.
