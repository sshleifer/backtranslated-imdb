This was the worst film I ever saw, but it was also the best film. Original science fiction movies are supposed to be bad, and that's what makes them fun! Line, "I love my dinosaur meat well done!" Probably the best quotation at all! Also, the plot seems like something out of the dream caused by the pot. I can imagine it now, wake up the book after a long night of waking up and play the dance revolution, then gather ideas for it: The Marine Corps arrived at the strange planet, which is full of dinosaurs and has a medieval role protecting a scientific team studying the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, it fits into the full checklist of Sci Fi: Medieval dinosaurs move through space to terrible action <br /> <br /> So watch this movie but do not buy it.
