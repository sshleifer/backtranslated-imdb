I really liked this film and promised to see it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Ms. I heard Detmers performance - she was like a hungry cat on a gus, playing with her frist. She is criticized in a state of anger and lust, with a "very small" lover, smashing hundreds of mother's fiance's mother cut off beautiful China on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful touches. Maserati, exquisite wardrobe, flower boxes along the rooftops. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the reading of Antigone. <br /> <br /> I had a sense of "O story" - that is, where people indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure. As you walk around the magnificent apartment in Orange, you feel comfortable - and why not, what is rein in "Satan in the flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real treat!
