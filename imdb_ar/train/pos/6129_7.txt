Note that I did not say it was better ... just more fun. Lack of social and realistic comments helps keep things going. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that this was not a Troma movie, since it contains all Troma's brands, including the transfer of acidic fluids and the trauma resulting from the evil after each murder, a ridiculous rape scene In the bathtub (a kind of hard-to-annoy, because the rapist is a snowman), the mute deputies. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, observed to have no legs or feet, leads a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Although it is supposed to be close to (or less) freezing, no one is showing a breath and there are no signs of the exhaust of the car while the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you of more fluffy peanuts or styrofoam than actual snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl gets her boyfriend's temperature just a few hours after her brother was horribly killed. You talk to him to storm the house of the corporal, from all places, in order to get him. But first, I told him that he had to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's teenage head was cut off by a skier runner, his father argues with Sheriff about whether Tommy, a cousin, has a relationship with her. Sharif asserts that Tommy did not fight with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet tall than Tommy." At that moment, someone aligns in the background, "Not anymore!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, Sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made of cloth for a long time. This is much better than a Tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or wrestlers wrestling with stuffed blacks. If I were a representative, I could not keep a straight face at this stage. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun movie. There is not much blood.
