When you are in a depressed or depressed mood, go to watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment, and it is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and human perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know Turkish and either Danish or German, go to watch the movie anyway. Half of the dialog box is originally Danish, synchronized with German in the translated version, and the other half is Turkish, translated in Danish or German, respectively.
