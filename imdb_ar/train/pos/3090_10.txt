I am very upset that ABC is giving up another offer that has the chance to be a real winner. This presentation is very good, and the writing and the story were fantastic, a real original idea of ​​the show instead of showing another boring reality. The molding was amazing! The characters and actors were not only direct, but this group of actors is very talented. The concept and idea is really a new and wonderful idea for a TV show, where many of us share this whole idea of ​​"communication." I really liked the characters of Stephen and Laura Whitney and Damian. But frankly, there is not one person connected to this show I did not like, even those who were only in a few episodes (Shiri Appleby for example). Acting and characters are very easy to love and very talented !!. I wanted ABC to have given this offer a bigger chance, and it did not cross the offer midway, and it was not announced enough. Really unfair! For everyone!!. This show showed a great promise. I will let ABC know what I feel and will continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. I worked for Girico. (By the way where is Episode 13? I want this last show!). Please support the show and send emails to ABC, we can do it! This show is worth it !!!
