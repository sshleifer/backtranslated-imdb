"Accurate hatred" is one of the best films to come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it's a wonderful movie by any means, but it's definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film "Hate" tells the cruel adventures of Eric Severs (played by director Kallio), a child who has been abused and is now growing up, and begins to listen to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very visually nice. Creative Picks, moody lighting and fun to look at. This film actually contains the value of production, unlike the recent versions of Michigan like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Nice shots and pop-up shots show good use of the $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> However, "hate" stumbles in the same places where there are lots of other local movies, this in the story section and characters. Basically, things just happen. Eric Severs does not develop at all. Basically, he was always crazy, people have started to notice it. Walk around the movie in a fun way with very little twist. Also, the end is very sudden. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror film, when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die, and "hate" is certainly accomplished. As the number of bodies rose, people in the theater began shouting "kill her! Kill everyone!" When people shout on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is where "hate" succeeds. it is fun. In the end, that's all that matters really.
