Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) comes to his son's place unexpectedly. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) was surprised to hear that his mother, Moriel Kleinmann (Olympia Dukakis) had left his father. Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters try to find Morel while Ben and his father go to see a farm for sale. But this is not the end of their journey. The road trip turns into a long treatment session between Ben and his father. Raymond de Felita is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the script and did a great job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is very amazing. He has worked with the script for twenty years so no wonder that this is a good who would be the best man to play the father of Peter Falk? No one, I can tell you that. I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter to be part of it. Peter was a representative making his father laugh. Peter certainly laughed in this film. Go fishing, how the old man beats the younger player in billiards and then beats him. The film is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times. But this can be the case from time to time. You can not tell a better story than her story here.
