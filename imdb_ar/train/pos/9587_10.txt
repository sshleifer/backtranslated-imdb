Fifteen years later, Paris is still burning. This classic in black gay films, there are directly with other gay black honorary films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This core work captures the culture and community of gay blacks and Latins who have not enjoyed any other work before or since then, including all gay Harlem's Renaissance and retrospective performances. It's good, but that's the best thing I say is that the only "real" movie you'll find on the subject is the film Relentlessy Cunty, which comes to Hollywood, a nonstop camp (just like we do) All this for his white film (obviously it was possible to be the sister of Gorel or Miz Thing in a previous life). I can continue, but I think you got the idea now: I love this movie!
