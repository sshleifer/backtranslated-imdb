"This is not a love song" is a film we have seen, which in my opinion is a film with a very simple story but a complex background story. If you scratch the surface, you will find a movie chasing two men running across the countryside from the farmers, after committing a murder: - "Looks like he is leaving completely." <br /> <br /> However, you need to look deeper until you uncover the real sense of this real kind. As he suggests, it's a love story between two gay lovers, full of trust, deception and betrayal. We are not told about this "love" directly through the film but the events that occur through the exit, for example the way in which Hayton behaves towards Spike almost screamed love relationship untouched in our faces. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a good example of why British films are not dismissed as "nonsense" because they are implemented on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good film with a complex story, it is certainly an acquired taste and may not be suitable for Hollywood fans.
