The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought to the screen again and will be noticed by many in the intellectual world. The director puts us in the companion of Alexander's story, a church study that is absent from chess addiction. Nastasya spends his holiday in a marble-floored resort where the chess tournament is hosted. Alexander meets by picking up a piece of queen falling through the pocket of his coat. Magnetic attraction develops as the mother proposes the following day to alarm the husband. We arrived and questioned Alexander, we have reached the past, such as Ala Godfather, where we see the young Alexander, a child prodigy. He was taken under the wing of the school teachers and used his genius for 10 years to get large sums. Thinking Alexander peaked, abandoned him but becomes a legend. The old teacher returns to cause harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In the dangerous chess game where the World Chess Champion is one of the ways of eternity, the chess clock ends and the game ends the next day. On that day is a wedding Nastasya, interferes with the old teacher Alexander is sent in a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, clutching her belly and looking through her coat of love and find his strategy for the game and follows the moves. Although the film is sadly swinging from its Russian roots, the low-back dresses are beautiful, but Alexander plays a wonderful role. We were unable to play at all, and the only hint was The Luzhin Defense after trading the queens, and the king isolated the opponents with 3 paws and the king, sacrificing the castle for a mate. Nastasya is a great match, but she feels that her conclusion deserves more intensity, but perhaps the emotions were realized in the check of the chess game that meant him more than her. Luzhin Defense is elegantly awarded the honor of Navokov, and the complexity of his work in the images is a global event that should not be missed.
