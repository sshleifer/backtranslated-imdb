First of all, I liked the music score of Bruce Broughton, very lyrical, and this alone is added to the magic of the film. The best aspects of the film were the three animals, expressed by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field, and the late late Don Amish. While Fox has the furthest lines, Ameche plays an interesting figure instead (Voice of Mind), Field adds wit in a character she always sees as she tells the opportunity. People were not attractive, and sometimes the film was dragged, but that's my only complaint. This is a nice-looking movie, with pretty close-up footage of Canada, I think. Although the film itself is too long, there is no dull moment at all, and this is what distinguishes sound work and well-written text. All in all, a charming and perhaps undervalued movie, with 9/10 of me. Bethany Cox.
