This film was like any film by Jimmy Stewart, clever, charming and very enjoyable. The performance of Kim Novak Kjillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be humane, wonderful, and her pleasant expressions, and every move and all her wishes create a unique Gillian that has left us hanging on every word. You should not fail to mention the praiseworthy shows of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lancaster, where the affectionate writer in Scotland was obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the beloved aunt who could seem to stop using magic even if it was forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are performed beautifully and the chemistry between them is great, but again when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any bad leading lady!
