I just watched the world premiere of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it completely. Here we have a welcome rephrase of this kind which is widely believed to have been led (certainly "embodied" widely and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director, a comedy! And, yes, I think it is better than "Shawn the Dead". Very reliable, and perhaps most important, shows are Dylan Baker, Carrie Ann Moss and young actor Cason Ray, who I think will see a lot of future features. However, I must admit that I enjoyed the role of Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor to Mr. Theopolis, where I played mainly a moving version of Victor van Dort from the band Cors Pride (or those who saw the film, will not "read this better here as Corpse Pride?), And of course the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his less vital role, but somehow radically behaves as a distinctive character, thinking only that he would not have had it if Peter Stormar had not committed to Prison Break Thursday.) I can only speculate that script writers should have been inspired by a lot Inspiration from "Day of the Dead" "Zombie." I'm not keen to reveal the details of the plot during the comment and I will not start now.It is enough to say that Fido is not one of the most scary zombie movies with which you can rely on Romero. The film will make you mocking constantly, and despite the great dose of bloodshed and violence, the delicious sense of humor, which was well promoted by the surrealist environment (though (I had to think well again to be sure) it was designed by director Kory and his partners In the screen, which goes a long way toward making this sound like a feature Rated PG-13. I urge you to go see this small jewel Canuck. I will definitely buy a DVD as soon as it appears by next summer.
