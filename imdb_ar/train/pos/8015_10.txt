I saw this film for the first time in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still shocks me. Muppets are very cool and they deal with business in a refreshingly naive manner. My favorite scene is when the mice start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit in a fancy restaurant. This is an intelligent and funny film for children and parents alike. Kermit lives, Miss Pig and the rest of the gang.
