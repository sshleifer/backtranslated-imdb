From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did you get rid of them? The display is not the same as before. Its way is worse. <br /> <br /> It was the best episodes with Carmen in it. You can not replace someone from the beginning! Like South Park without Kyle or Childs Without Chucky! It's not right! The daughter they just replaced is, Love! Sei. It does not fit into the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and the daughter could not replace her. She was a wonderful actress. Way better than daughter. Get her back, or you will lose tons of viewers.
