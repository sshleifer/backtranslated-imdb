Joseph does not remember. Mankowitz by most of the day as one of the best directors in the history of Hollywood, but this film proves that it is. Mankiewicz has already made a great success by presenting American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, as well as his success in adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar. He is doing a great job in this wonderful Broadway play of great photography and style. Marlon Brando is ideal as Sky Masterson, even if he is not able to sing well. He is the only actor who can take it off completely with its composure and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good like Sarah Brown and her scenes with sizzling Brando with great chemistry. All the supporting actors are in turn, especially Sheldon Leonard in the role of Harry the Horse in a very funny game. However, Mankiewicz must be given the most credit for bringing a fine music in itself to the screen in a way that feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musician and works on many levels that should not normally be.
