This is where the term "classic film" comes from. This is a wonderful story about women's courage, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan was sold to her unyielding husband, whom she had learned over the years. (Yes, true, Pearl !!) <br /> <br /> Louis Reiner was the beautiful star who won Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what is lost of Oscar) at The Great Zigfield. She really did not show her talent, if any, other than her strange beauty. But in the "good land" show she can really act! Her beauty has been wiped out and she has no great fashion either. People say they did not show any real feelings in this film. Like hell. Her character Ulan is shy and shy, with inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the film with her eyes and body just to express her feelings. Example: Those scenes during the fall of the city and when the thieves were shot. If you say it does not work well in this movie, you do not look! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni explains that he is capable of acting well. His character is not a favorite figure for me. He never saw what it was, until the end of the story. Sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own beauty. The greatest thing is, the beauty of the interior, like the pearl. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie, watch it. You'll see one of the best films made by Hollywood's Golden Age.
