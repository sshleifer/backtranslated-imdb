The Woman In Black was a British television producer first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve in 89, and again in 1992. I think he toured American television on A & E. VHS was released in Britain in the early 1990s but has run out. An American company released it on a DVD later, but this version has also been sold. According to the author's website, the rights to the film are now owned by someone else and will not be released again, and there are informal collections of shoes sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie recently on a message board and I had to check it out. I found a copy on eBay for about $ 28. Be sure to be a fake from a seller in the Far East, although the DVD says "Made in Canada", ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can not actually make bootleg ratings in rare or out-of-print versions, and you've lost legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the film. It is a piece of time that was identified in the 1920s, with all the original and exotic British settings of the time. Black women are very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very low but effective and scary. There is no gore in the soul, or violence or special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create chilling moments. It is a classic chilling film. It seems that the film itself was made in the 1930s except for color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror films, I am afraid that this film is always a lost gem. For me, it puts itself as a favorite over the ages.
