What can I say about this film that has not already been said? Well to tell the truth a lot of it seems very fake like some slaps and kicks. How Charlie Shane Although this was real I do not know. I'm sure they'll hit and knock it harder if that's the case. But scenes with piracy and hot oil look very real. The last needle in the eye sight is amazingly surprising and probably the only thing in the film that shocked me.
