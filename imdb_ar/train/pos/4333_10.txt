I saw this in the preview - wonderful movie - wonderful descriptions - clever and intelligent dialogue - the actors were wonderful - Peter Falk would be an Oscar - Paul Reiser was enchanting - the photography was wonderful was the razer in the theater when we saw the movie gave a vivid account of the film industry - His long dream was to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationship between children and parents, and more specifically between him and his father - this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion - the supportive actors were chosen and the film was given a sense of family - I recommend this movie to anyone who yearns to see the smart drama and wonderful shows
