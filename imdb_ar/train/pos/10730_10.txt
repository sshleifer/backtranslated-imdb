Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at the same time as the Challenger explosion. Which really put the crimp when to take it out or even if it should, and take it out. I'm glad they did it. I first saw SpaceCamp in a movie in the car. Which greatly boosted viewership. <br /> <br /> While I heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skirt. I did not hear about others in the film. So it was a great shock for me to find all these young people acting and behaving well! Of course, Kate Cabshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the scenes, where these children were shown how to act as a team. Scenes of children preparing for a trip can only hope. The actual launch of a spacecraft is, of course, old news for us. However, this was a different one. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most cherished films I might have escaped, but it was great for space jose like me. After renting maybe for 30-40 times. Finally I found it available in a certain shop and bought it. Now, if it just comes out on the DVD. Maybe I'll get it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 of me.
