I have not seen a film with Nolte yet I did not like it. However, I've been told that he made a lot of movies and watched a few of them. In my mind, I keep his images here and those in the "red line". We have a full range of proxy talents. When it is necessary to shout screaming like a wounded lion. His best moments are those I admire in actors: when he is immersed in gestures of face, hand and body without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors, to a large extent, has no appreciation of what any representative can do without speaking, without conscious appreciation for the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of representatives relies heavily on computer magicians. Of course, it's just a sign of the times we live in. If Chaplin lived in our time .... who knows, he may also become a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I have not read Vonnegut's novel that comes from this movie to the screen. However, the map has not been brought up yet so we can not follow the path that has been put, even with all the surprises. Of course at first it seems useless. However, it is not impossible also. <br /> <br /> Think of it for beginners: Spy in the heart of the Third Reich: An exceptional life for Fritz Colby, the most important American spy in World War II by Delater and Prichard (see Amazon for more details). Consider: Secret History: The Breakthrough of the Reich: American Spies Inside the Nazi DVD in Germany (see this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) It seems to be the production of a history channel. <br /> <br /> So, is the story ridiculous? Out of reach Yes, impossible, no. Return to the plot. The Nolte character is recruited and accepts a dangerous mission impossible, and unfortunately the text does not give us enough reason to accept it. Was this a kind of negativity, he absorbed this role as he says because it was the best story ever written and had to play the role? This is hard to imagine. But, it's been an unusual time and people have done extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> Acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent, as people have pointed out that Alan Arkin, always wonderful, is very good at role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked at the end of the film (no - I will not spoil it) and made me feel scared about this choice. Did this person know that the road was finally over and talked about all that was necessary and that any other chapters would be added to a life already filled with many scorched pages? It's hard to say that it really shakes. <br /> <br /> Nolte offers one of the best performances you can expect .... The movie buildings make you wonder about many things. It's very entertaining and exciting. What films should be wonderful. A bit long but worth it. By the way, the music of the films contains selections from one of the best live composers: Arvo Part.
