Together with his favorite photographers and Clarence Brown's liberating assistant, Star Beckford and director Turneyor - wonderful beauty and intelligence of this story about the isolated islanders of Scotland - the same area that Michael Powell will be doing 20 years later - is his first major success. The visions of wind and waves, silhouettes of sun lovers not only complete the story, but the story of the struggle against hardship. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of the proud people to their roles, and Beckford is as wonderful as struggling with her own duties as clan leader and hesitating between comedy and thinking, here with her father Thor attacking the islanders wandering to the church and sitting there with Walking stick to her guest in her hand like a mace, her lover is discussed, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> Learn if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the group. I tried but failed.
