No movies caught my attention like this one he has. As you can see, I wanted to watch this film again for more than twenty-five years. The only time I saw her was in her teens, which may be the year she was released in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the film is that he touched those deep feelings so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to see him again. The plot that this film provides by the human element of searching for and searching for the Father / Son will surely touch every human spirit you see. Why do not this film get out of storage and display it often like other less depth films, I do not know. <br /> <br /> PostScript: A copy of the film was received and after seeing it again he was pleased to see that my memory was held correctly. The rating reflects the content of the film. You want to watch this movie on a DVD like seeing this 1977 production on the VHS tape the user took away from the overall quality.
