There are some comments about this film that say it is a bad and silly film and an excellent actor like Pierre Friesnay should not have accepted it. <br /> <br /> I think, quite the contrary, even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so wonderful that it transforms the film into something excellent. <br /> <br /> It may be his best performance in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself contains a very controversial scene about wine-making at the clubhouse. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe that a priest? So one is damaged? Can be converted by the blood of Christ, the scene is probably strange. But for someone who grew up in a Catholic context, he is very exciting even if he is very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the young priest is very shocking. But he behaved very well. Pierre Friesnay turns the mad crime into something understandable in the timid madness of his character, the tortured Morand, who has returned to his duty in this terrible way.
