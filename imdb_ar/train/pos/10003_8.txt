This is not Mel Brooks' model film. He was less enthusiastic than most of his films and already had a blueprint to follow. Leslie Ann Warren made the film, a wonderful and wonderful actress. There were some moments that could have been a little more embodying, and some scenes that might have been cut to make room for it, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and watch. Overall acting was good, Brooks himself did a good job without talking about his character directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but both "Fume" and "Sailor" played their part well.
