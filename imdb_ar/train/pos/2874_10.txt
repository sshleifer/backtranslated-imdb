Cinderella is a pretty young woman who is treated harshly by her evil father's wife and her children. One day, a ball is held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella does not have a chance to go, because her father's wife and sisters will not let her do so. With the help of her fictional godmother and her friends in the animals, she is out of the ball, with a warning to return home by midnight. In the ball meet the handsome charming prince. When she hits the clock in the middle of the night, she runs the house, leaving behind one of the glass slippers. With the help of her friends of animals, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince later married, and lived happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, which was released 56 years ago, has achieved great success at the box office, and continues to attract the masses to this day. It has a well written text. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes," "That's Love," and "Great Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," help story the story. This was my favorite film and it did not lose its charm. Disney real masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10. The latest DVD version is the best way to estimate this movie, including features, deleted scenes, music videos, old radio programs, and a hard copy of the movie!
