This game contains everything: nudity, good fighting scenes, humor, movement, explosions, and so on. She also starred Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer suggested - although Olga later turns to Ingrid in the film (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> It will not bother me to go into the story because it did not take long and was not very fun. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Genti) is interesting - watch the scene of the towel stealing to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were good at the same time, and some really bad characters spoiled the effects that seemed to have been made by the team that performed City of the Walking Dead (a strange colored blood flowing from neck wounds) ). <br /> <br /> I advise low-budget trash fans to check if they can track a copy - it's very rare and I could not see anyone bothering to reissue it to become more scarce in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I d recommend it only to the blind Belinda Maine scenes! That lady fox!
