Delivery is a wonderful tale, full of fun and sometimes disturbing to James Dickey, turned into a wonderful film by John Bormann. It concerns four businessmen, motivated by masculinity and manly behavior, who spend a weekend in canoes in the mountains. There, they face every aspect of the darkest man and all the worst forms of human misery ... poverty, theft, and even physical harassment! These four men were planning to travel down the river in search of adventure and excitement, but their journey would soon turn into a humiliating journey across a violent mountainous terrain, far from all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most nightmare movies I have ever seen. About everything that happens to these guys, you pray that you will not find yourself in a similar situation. Pure pure cinema, delivery film is also very important film. The best film by John Bormann (followed closely by Zardouz and Axlebor) - and still - is a very moving film and contains many memorable scenes that have already appeared in countless other films. Just think of the brilliant musical result "Dueling banjos" and, of course, the gay rape scene "unforgettable" sex. All actors offer (haha) offers an ideal representation. Especially John Voight. Must see the animation!
