I really enjoyed this film because I have a great interest in American history ... the years before the war and civil war in particular. I recently purchased a collection of previously viewed videos from the supermarket and I was very happy to add this video to my collection of videos. Though not the caliber of civil war films like "Glory" or "Gettysburg," it offers a lot of history about pre-civil war brothers among West Point students. <br /> <br /> This may be gray uniform, youth, or military discipline, but I am intrigued by the story of the Cadet Corps from about 1830 to the brink of war. I imagine how you should have been sitting in a classroom with other young people, learning how to make war, then putting lessons later to use against your classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes that graduated in 1861: one in May and the other in June. The film does not mention the truth of this, except Henry A. DuPont, the first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, the last grade of June class. The two chapters were not about war, but the result of a return to a four-year course, a few years after a five-year course (I think the first class was five years old and the other four). As the film depicts, students were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonso "Lun" Cushing. James "Beauty" Stuart (JEB Stuart, class 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this film is "Santa Fe Trail" because it was supposed to be a 1940 film, while it was fun, and fascinating history. Trainees from several different classes graduate together. JEB Stuart and George Custer were portrayed as the best friends who are side by side in stopping John Brown's 1859 rebellion at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Chester were not friends, but they were enemies during the war. They encountered each other (for the first time, I think) in Gettysburg in 1863 (Stewart was in Harper's ferry raid, but Custer was still a student at the point when he signed). <br /> <br /> "Custer" plays a part in "Class of '61," although his co-authors, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton, are fictional. I think they depend on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look for. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really enjoy this movie or any film that provides a window in the middle of the 19th century America.
