The original title means "birth of octopuses". I must admit that I do not fully understand this title. The title in English is "water lilies". But after I wrote this, I read the comment by another user: "The title in French also suggests:" prieuve ", or octopus, indicates that an individual has to reconcile several pressures at once. Thank you for the clarification. <br /> <br /> The primary theme is the first sexual feelings of girls, when it is not clear whether they are gender-oriented or otherwise. It's no different from boys. I think both Florian and Mary will end up feeling different sexual feelings without any additions. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is a water ballet. Sometimes girls have their heads down, and there is nothing above the water except for their low legs and legs, which they will wave and toss in the air. For people like me who have never seen such things before, it was wonderful. - Florian is the captain of one team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Mary told her she wanted to see when Florian was training. This seems to be their first contact is not just normal. Soon they will walk together. Florian takes Mary to a garage where a boy waits, then goes with him for an hour while Mary waits for her return. I took for granted that the couple slept with each other. But we will learn later from the film that they are doing less. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that a few users will find anywhere else. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals a garbage bag in Florian. You find an apple, often eaten. And Mary begins to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" (afternoon breezes) by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). This is about young female adults, and lesbian women are clearly in love with a heterosexual woman. He also steals a garbage bag for the lover, and finds a fairly well-fed apple and the rest. <br /> <br /> Florian Marie later told her she wanted to get her first orgasm. Mary says she can not do this. <br /> <br /> But Mary later says she is ready to do so. She masturbates on Florian. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director is only capable of making such a good psychological presentation or study ?? I would like to quote from Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Florian played the role of Adele Hannel, who performed an excellent performance as an autistic girl in Christophe Rogia's "The Little Devils" (2002). ? Very understated film.
