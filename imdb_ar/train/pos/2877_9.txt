I do not think I need to tell you the story. Because it was said for years and years. So I will share my feelings only. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then I was a kid from Disney in a good way. Animation now looks childish and old-fashioned, but that's part of her charm now. Now, in the High School Musical era and the images created by the computer, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of Disney's first films. Thankfully I was born before I even got to know this classic. It seems that no matter how old I get, I go back to that five-year-old boy and watch him on VHS. It is the true Disney charm.
