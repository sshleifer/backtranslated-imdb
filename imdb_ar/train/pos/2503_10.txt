I'm picky about the movies I see. I heard about the baby moon quite by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and have been a fan of Gackt and Mizer just recently. <br /> <br /> I finally discovered that the movie was being re-released and captured without the second thought. <br /> <br /> Since I am very important to films, I will admit that motion scenes can be somewhat volatile at times ... but it is supposed to be, as another user suggested, the perfect calm before the storm "Without the spoilers, the film hit me hard, because you realize that the limits of friendship are boundless and, as many say, the true friendship is loyalty and marriage, even death is part of you. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt showcases why they can adhere to the depth of their lyrics, their passion for music on the big screen and in the process creates an ideal film that reaches the spirit of the person and evokes emotional reactions. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I realized that it would probably remain in a severe rotation with respect to my group. I want to encourage anyone who reads this publication to take a movie if you want to stay away from the current Hollywood trend in the film ... This takes a completely new direction using Yakuza's classic film elements and how you can make a mistake in the appearance of Rio Ishibashi's film " Suicide Club "in Takashi Miyake? <br /> <br /> Man..I can not say enough about this film, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
