Wonderful! The kind of movie you can watch 10 times and I'm still happy at the nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this is Visconti's first film, I'm shivering to think about what will happen if I get the best from one film to another. The only other thing I have seen (at the time of writing) is "Death in Venice" - which is unbelievable at all: more dazzling than "obsession." One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, but her story was not included in Ossession. If you click "Miscellaneous" on the links to this page, there are movie clips on those sites. They will not really judge the film's experience: such as great camera movements, this beautiful combination, these wonderful faces, such wonderful characters as the development of the great story, the first film adapted from The James Post's The Postman Always Rings. Twice. "<br /> <br /> I can not believe that this was done in 43, eight years ago Brando was supposed to have made a realistic representation of the world with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). They probably did not really feel everything (I do not know anything about it) - but they represent some of the best and most realistic and realistic presentations to date in the cinema. "Eight years before bringing Streetcar Named Desire to a new sensation on the screen, Ossessiony was exciting! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes, I am superior, but Ossession was so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The reason that Ossessione did not cause the effect of Streetcar e It was made in Fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini, and was cut back in America American viewers did not see its full glory until 59, eight years after Streetcar. <br /> <br /> I will not say more about it - just write to tell you that it is one of the best, most beautiful and famous The movies I saw at all, and I tell you to go out and watch them! Like another reviewer, I'll buy it once I find it!
