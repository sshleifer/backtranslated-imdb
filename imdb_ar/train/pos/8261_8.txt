The appeal of a passionate and naive but unmistakably emotional man, in this case embodied as German and French miners who were forced to close off after the Great War thanks to the new frontier, disappointed the German side, as the French are the leaders. But when the fire starts on the French side, the common decency of German men leads to help, safety and even friendship. This was an appeal that would fall on deaf ears within a decade, as a certain man by Babest would break that piece and turn the Great War into an introduction. But it is clear to me that Babst truly believes or wants to hope for this kind of basic humanity, because this film radiates this optimism, while his most generous and vocal adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacks the necessary touches to make this work a success. . Also reinforces his sincere faith in the fact that the characters here are not simple careers, but real people, with real families living in our home. These are ordinary working-class men who only believe in the value of caring for and treating your fellow men. On this day of individual opportunism, I will slightly ease my compulsion to get a positive message representing a point of view that I think we can aspire to. <br /> <br /> (Note: It is clear that the end has been cut on most publications, where the French are rebuilding the mining gate and closing the men again.) This is a wild turn of events, and maybe the movie made a better film overall, but I was I will regret to calm the positive feelings of the final sequence, so in short, I am glad that it has been cut.) {Grade: 8/10 (b) / # 7 (of 11) 1931}
