This eerie film was a misfortune of being released at the same time from the highly acclaimed "Amelie" film, both of which were played by the leading Audrey Tautou. Laurent Verod, the talented director produced one of the most interesting films that came out of France in modern memory. <br /> <br /> The film is an opportunity, as its title indicates in English. The French title refers to how butterfly wings create chaos over the Atlantic Ocean as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, which is unbelievable by looking at these colored insects. From the beginning, the director intersects with all the characters that the person sees in the film, and how they relate to each other, which is difficult to imagine, but seems to be in the context of the film works well. Meeting opportunity in the metro determines the tone of the film. Mrs. Jalsa asked Iris, who would work, to tell her what her zodiac sign was and start reading from her paper. Irene, she seems to cross the roads and find her soul mate on the same day. After Erin leaves the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman tells her that he has the same birthday as Irene. They seem to be heading to each other from the start, but unfortunately, they will not reconnect until the final frame of the film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tutu is as awesome as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, has little to do until the end, but he seems to have a presence and play well. The talented young actors make a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as the butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> Look forward to the future films written by Laurent Verod because it seems to be a heart-shaped outlet in the right place and ear to the way humans communicate.
