Although Lang's version is more famous, Borszag's work is not without interest, far from it: His "heavenly" sequences are better. The metaphor of the train (probably borrowed from the end of the film "la roue" for Abel Gance) is convincing from the "top above" heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Hanan Borzaj's character appears in Mary's character and love behind the tomb is one of his favorite themes (the end of "Three Companions"). Entertainment The park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we're in poor Mary's house. I do not think the large groups of cheese, they are simplified at fault. The exhibition from afar almost feels the science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Borsage never forgets his social interests: on the celestial train that ascends, the rich can not stand with the dispute, but as the "Chief Justice" says: "Here there is no other difference." <br /> <br /> It is not a major work for Borzage (not the Lang version), but to find out if you are interested in the career of a great director.
