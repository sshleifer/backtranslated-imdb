The wonderful thing about Withnail & I is that it embodies that it was not long in college and life can go either way with all the other finishes. Freebird is something for those who probably never thought of higher education and went directly to work at the age of 15/16. I know that some of the wide sheets hung the knife in this film when it was shown in cinemas, but I saw it in a crowded house in Haylesham and everyone seemed to enjoy it really. I grew up in a forest of religion, which brought me back directly to the days of mushrooms and drugs (I had some great colleagues - I hate to think about everything yet - perhaps running the local council). I've seen it several times on a DVD and I already see the movie as an old partner that will stay forever as part of my collection (how can I love this movie and the Dambusters - does not seem true somehow) edge towards the second half of this film I think the viewer social interaction with the locals Are done brilliantly. I like the group of three outstanding characters, and there is really some brilliant writing here along with some quoteable lines, and I dare say I am honest to be honest. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (shame, it's a curcier). Someone told me it was originally a play, I'm not quite sure how to do it but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespeare touches / references that seem to appear throughout the film (also spotted Ref Dylan Thomas as well) and like all the little gems, there will always be small things to discover like the final scene giving a signal to Easyrider as they start their next trip. All in all a really modest piece of filmmaking (I love it!)
