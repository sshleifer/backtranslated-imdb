There's something about every film "hammer" I see that really takes me to a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" films, nothing can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those types of films. It's adventures deep in magic and hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
