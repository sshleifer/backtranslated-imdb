I did not read the other comments on the film, but from the average rating, I think it is unlikely to be too complementary. <br /> <br /> I saw him for the second time with my children. They loved him perfectly. True, the adults were not rolling around the earth, but the sound of enjoying the children made it seem so. <br /> <br /> It's a real farce from Brooks' tendency, with so much moral content - how sad it is to be loved by our money, not by who we are, and how volatile our friends and partners are. There are many other films on a similar theme, no doubt, many of which will have a more playful or emotional impact on adults. It is hard for me to imagine such an impact on small family members, so for children, 9/10 is mine.
