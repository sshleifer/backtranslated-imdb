Men can criticize Lollo if they like (or lollos - she gave her name in colloquial French), but the ladies have a bit more delicious at Gerard Philippe, who is not only beautiful but I can act. Do not be deterred if your version does not contain subtitles because in this simple love story of love and war, in which everything is fair, there is no need for it. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Felipe's palm and tells him that he will marry the daughter of the king. After that, the story became quite clear of the Gallic gestures, running, jumping and sword. <br /> <br /> On the minus side, the clarity of the story and the weariness of her face becomes quite agitated, and it is annoying that the French themselves seem too superior to Hollywood so as not to bother even trying to make sense of her exciting stunts. Of course the non-French-speaking part of ooh-la-la is missing, such as: virtuous girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: Dear, what made you think I'm interested in this bagatelle?
