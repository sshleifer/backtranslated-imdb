Wacky hackers penetration, babe, safe, baby. Add them all and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of before. <br /> <br /> Even with an existing star force (at least minus ... well, b-plus?) this movie got a little publicity. <br /> <br /> Does not diminish its genius. <br /> <br /> The brilliant writing, strong delivery and a group of authentic characters. Some classic lines are real, and the evolution is enjoyable in the end. <br /> <br /> This is not some "Nutty Professor" comedy extenuating. These are bad-life bad guys. They speak the bad man's language in low life and do the bad guy things in low life. But they do it for entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comics I've ever seen.
