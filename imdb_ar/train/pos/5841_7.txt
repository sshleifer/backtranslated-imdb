The story of peace-loving farmers and townspeople who are fighting for land, water, law and order, respect and subordination of long-established livestock interests and their rented guns have been better improved earlier (Shin) and possibly later films as well. There are some good motion scenes and overall layout of the story, except for the disappointing ending, well executed. Law, order, and religion have established roots in the city, but the old system of cattle engines, cowboys, and gun breeders still exists. The clash between the two takes place in a well-organized ambush where the city's population is directly entangled in a trap. Gunger, the former fighter, plays the man who avoids the townspeople who need his rifle experience.
