I was very impressed by this small, self-made image. The story, which revolves around a pair of social outcasts who meet, become friends, and provide each other with a support system that seems to lack children, is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. The music, mostly by underground bands, was used extensively, as was used with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. The shows (the book and film director's offers) are the best I've seen in the last couple of years. If you feel like a square-shaped day in a round hole, I really think you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook."
