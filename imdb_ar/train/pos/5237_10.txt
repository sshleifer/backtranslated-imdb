Are we all creating our own reality, or are we? This is the fundamental question behind this very original examination and ingenuity in the phantom nature of reality. Oriental and Buddhist philosophies are mixed with the visual distortion of M.C. Escher, this remarkable message enables us to face the brain question of "who are we and what is our place in the universe?" , Turning it into 100 minutes of fun. The film focuses on Bart, a writer struggling with the script for his film The Sea Who Think. While sitting on his computer, work begins in illustration as it is nothing more than a description of sitting on a computer, writing a script. Before long, he was stuck in a mystery surrounded by everything he wrote became true. Director Gert De Graff deals with his theme with a sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of amazing visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perceptions. In the end, De Graf defies audiences on several levels to ask whether anything we see, touch or taste is really what it looks like, or whether our full understanding of the universe and our place in it is a hoax our senses have played.
