This was a classic film. I would say that this film captured the best working man who learns from his mistakes. If we can get along and learn how everyone has done in this film. It has been an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can make you lose something important in life if we can not find the "BIG throat" and ingest the pride.
