An excellent farce! Which, of course, is all that is meant to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, and there is no slightest attempt in this direction. Can you take the plot already, or have occurred at any given time or location? It is unlikely, because, after all, this simply, just a film, the films stem from fiction, not from reality. The only goal of this film is to entertain, certainly not to educate, entertain, with the fun and fun reality of the wind. I think most of them agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for entertainment, I want what is now described as "forbidden thinking," a mating game in all respects. For a few laughs that laugh frankly from time to time, this is a wonderful fantasy.
