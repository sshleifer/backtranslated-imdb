There are some wonderful photos and a beautiful heart here for a range of landscapes and animals, from the Arctic to the tropical and everything in between. The camera techniques are diverse and situational from close to aerial work. Editing is enormous and commentary is also in place, with a correct tone and some dramatic and wise facts about our world. Where the film is located slightly in an attempt to cover and integrate four axes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and fishing / fishing interactions across multiple environments. In the end everything gets a little bitty and disjointed. In general, it is worth watching especially given the problems covered but do not expect to get the Oscar material.
