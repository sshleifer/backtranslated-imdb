I love Peter Sellers, most of the time. I have never seen him filming Brett from the top layer until this film. It pulls it well, although you see parts of Inspector Clauso in the mix. It will not be so interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected young Hawn to make that strong performance. Its timing was great and its expressions were priceless. The way you alternately shoot the vendors with a spoiled character and seduce him is beautiful to watch. I rarely saw verbal sparring from a film of that era. <br /> <br /> Do not drop the last 30 minutes of the movie. We should only fail to see the first 60. Naked mortar for a few glorious seconds ahead of time. enjoy it...
