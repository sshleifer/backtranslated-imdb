After a brief introduction, a masked man stabs and cuts the throat of an older man on an abandoned Australian street. At the turn of the 20th century, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they leave the house. They managed to get a loan to get the upper fixer on one of Sydney's luxury streets, but it turned out that physical dysfunction was not the only problem in their new home. It may be inhabited. <br /> <br /> 13 The Gantry Row combines a somewhat memorable clich√© story with a good-to-moderate direction by Catherine Millar to slightly above average shock. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawbacks seem partly because of the budget, but not a complete excuse for that obstacle. A critical problem occurs at the beginning of the movie. The inaugural "thrill scene" is characterized by subtle alterations. Freezing frames and a series of shots are used to cover up the fact that there are not many actions. The thrill of staging must be created, not the "fix it in luxury" luxury techniques. There is a wonderful atmosphere in the scene of the site, lighting, fog, etc., but the camera must slowly follow the killer and victim, intermittent back and forth from one to the other as we follow the street and show them increased proximity. Tracking and reductions need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better. As it is, the scene has a strong sense of "made for television" and a low budget in it. <br /> <br /> After this scene, we move on to the present and greatly improve the flow of the film. The story has many similarities with Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget dictates a more precise approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively creates many creepy scenarios, often exciting in nature rather than special effects, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take the old iron plates, which are attached to an inner wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror lovers, the first part of the film may be a bit heavy on real drama. At least in the first half of the first hour of the film revolves around Julie and Peter in an attempt to arrange the financing of the house and then try to settle it. But Murph writes a good and intelligent dialogue. The material works so well enough that it is often as impressive as the more exciting aspects that arise later - especially if you experience similar problems while trying to buy your home. <br /> <br /> Things settle down and things get weirder, although the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. Offers help create tension. There is no abundance of death and destruction in the film - there are many nightmares of repairing houses. But no threat really poses a goal. <br /> <br /> The point is human relations. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house is more metaphorical and a catalyst for tension in a romantic relationship that may make it corrupt and potentially destroy. Being in a luxury neighborhood, and the relationship between two successful yogurt shows that these problems not only affect those who can blame some external problems, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a Mujahid employee who has "normal" friendships at work to someone who has more despair when he becomes fragile and plans to reach something more liberal and meaningful. At the same time, we learn how these professional friends can be shallow. Julie goes through almost a nervous breakdown, but eventually finds liberation when she frees herself from her failed romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although the 13 Gantry Row never surpasses its hustle and bustle made for television, like a TV movie, this is very good, with great ambitions. Anyone who is fond of haunted house movies, psychological films or horror / thriller films with a little more metaphorical depth must find plenty to enjoy. Sure, it's not worth spending $ 30 on a DVD (this was the price I was asking from the local PBS station to get a copy of the film after it was introduced), but it's worth the rent, and certainly worth watching for free.
