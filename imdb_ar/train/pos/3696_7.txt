Although I live in Minnesota, I have been studying in France recently and have been exposed to this exotic jewel for a film. <br /> <br /> This film was amazing, at the very least. An innovative and unique film, each of the different directors presented something different from their interpretation of love in the city of light. The first instinct is to try to contain each of these small stories in a comprehensive story, as much as can be done with love in fact in 2003. This attempt, however, makes the charm of each individual piece obsolete. When filmed in nominal terms, taking each short clip as his own single film, the stories of love together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes strange - somewhat confusing - and each individual slide may be difficult to follow. However, for an observer who pays close attention to each of the sectors, the short lines become clear soon. The confusion is almost interesting. Keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next. He leaves the viewer wondering, "Has this really happened?" So far leaves them satisfied that it has already happened. It is the kind of film where the viewer can not decide whether they love him or hate him when he leaves the theater. The initial reaction is to go and watch it over and over, just to see this individual life gather together in a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make a multi-lingual film adds something to a group of people who can relate. It adds to the reality of the film - here, talking English American tourists, French Parisians, and so on. The number of people involved in the film leads to an understanding of the universal language of love. <br /> <br /> From illness to supernatural, love of parents to love of couples, this film covers all the rules of romantic storytelling. In every beautiful and strange way, each unique event somehow falls somewhere to tell the story: a story of all kinds, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
