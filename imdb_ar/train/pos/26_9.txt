When I was a kid I watched this several times, and I remember the song "Happy Cat" often. All the songs are wonderful and do not really forget, unlike many of the children's musicals, where the songs are suspended for no real reason. The scenery and costumes are luxurious, and the representation is very good, which is not surprising, given the cast. Christopher Walken is very ugly, does not need stupid makeup, or a cat costume so the viewer thinks he's a cat turned into a human being. Jason Connery is very cute, like a shy and confused son, Corinne, who falls in love with the beautiful princess Vera and the daring. It is a really fun and enjoyable film, as unlike most fairy tales, characters are given to characters. Some of my favorite things are when Puss makes Corin pretend to be drowning; on the ball when everyone starts dancing on country dance, because "all the rage is out"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dances on the table (he's a very good dancer!); Vera Corinne with all the things she used to do when she was small, like pretending to be the daughter of a mill. I recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairy tales. It is actually a movie you can watch together, because it will not push adults to the top of the wall.
