I think the dark angel is great! The first season was excellent, and it was a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 machine he escaped from creating Manticore, trying to adapt to normal life, but still "saving the world". It is being hunted by the manticore throughout the season which gives the serial some additional spices. <br /> <br /> The second season though it suddenly became a little weird compared to the first season. Kinda's plot disappeared, and the serial lost a bit of its charm, mostly due to the appearance of all the alien "creatures". Do not get me that the second season is good, but with a large part of a lot of "manticores". However, they managed to return to a promising new plot in the closing episodes of Season 2, which I had a lot of hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really hope that they can start making new loops. And with James Cameron behind it, there can be no mistake. In conclusion, I would say it's a wonderful series, yet I still hope in the third season!
