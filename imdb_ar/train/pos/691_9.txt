You'll come clean. The only reason I discovered about this DVD is that Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it would be different ... maybe not in a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading a few reviews there were about this in short, I was actually excited to see it. I was sent to my copy as soon as possible and received it after a few weeks. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an insomnia who often suffers from circumstances that make him doubt what is the reality, and what is in his head. I will not give up what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be scary in realism. <br /> <br /> The output is wonderful, focusing on what is necessary for the story without letting it lose any moments of entertainment or exciting moments. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this wonderful film 9 out of 10, far beyond what I thought could be achieved.
