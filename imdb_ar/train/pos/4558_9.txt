I believe that my left is a wonderful autobiography about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The displays were smashing and the soundtrack was fantastic and the choice was perfect. I thought Christie (Daniel Day Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he was saying most of the time. In addition, when he threw a fit of anger, I felt a little scared. Also, it is very sad that he suffers from Cerebral Palsy. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Daniel Dae Lewis, or the like, I strongly recommend this biography of one of the most talented writers and painters in the world. You are in real fun and fun time, so do not miss this experience.
