This strangeness of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lie at the time he did so. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment where the former tenant committed suicide. Becomes obsessed with finding out what has driven her to such an extent that he is dressed in juvenile events and re-represented in the way she might be. The film is somewhat annoying and has a terrifying atmosphere that Polanski excels in, but it is more than a rewriting of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other Polanski films that deal with the mood of the apartments. <br /> <br /> But for the concern ... Unless I read a lot in the film, I must believe that this was a reaction to the feelings of persecution Polanki felt was being described as sexual deviation and exile from America. I do not judge him in one way or another myself, but it is hard to deny the evidence in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
