New Movie. Tells the story of a childish fantasy, tells us how we are trapped in social attitudes and what sort of extreme measures one must behave differently. Or at least feeling: that you should break every rule if you want to break a single base. If you want to express love to someone you do not know, how will you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about the fascism of deciding cultural life about others and about what kind of culture is stored in our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the bomber the right to decide what is our choice. No one can drink morning coffee alone. Should we listen to the NRJ shout, see stupid newspaper headlines and street commercials even before our morning coffee?
