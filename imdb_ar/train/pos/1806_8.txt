I hope the children's films have been made this way; dark and deep. There was (get this) personal evolution (and Charlie is an example of a dynamic personality), developing plot, brilliant animation, emotional engagement, and a rational, dependable, and consistent theme. If this is not for a handful of dancing and dancing, you will never think it was a children's film, which is why I give it a high degree of classification. This film is an excellent film, not to mention a film for children. This leads me to my second point: it should be the darkest movie "children" I've ever seen, coming from a 22-year-old film. I will be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not quite terrified during the last half and some of the first half of the film, and it ends with one of the worst endings I can ever encounter (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those of you Futurama fans) Makes this movie good. Just because the film raises feelings in general and we do not like to feel it and assume it is bad does not make the film itself bad; in fact, it means it worked. Supposed to laugh good funny movies. The good horror movies are supposed to frighten us. We should be saddened by good sad films. My point is that good movies are supposed to convey to you, not just entertainment; <br /> <br /> Also, this incredibly violent movie according to today's standards for children's film, contains a theme that may not be suitable for some children according to today's standards. Parents, I would say watch it first. I usually do not say anything about this kind of thing, but I saw this yesterday and it was a surprise to me.
