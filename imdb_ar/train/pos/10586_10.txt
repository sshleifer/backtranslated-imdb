Oliver Stone has produced a film and one of the first films in an impressive career by Lloyd Kaufman (co-founder and head of the world's only real cinema studio, Troma, creator of Toxic Avenger) and the prestigious Amsterdam Fantastic Filmf Festival After collecting the money for this film on his own, Lloyd wrote this scenario with Theodore Gershoni in 1970, and regrets it too late to listen to the advice to make Gershuni direct the film instead of doing it himself, but at that time he was still He lacks experience in business and may be due In fact, it was interesting to see Lloyd's copy of his own text - as one of the most daring, inexperienced, and non-compromising original filmmakers in the world, and who is likely to be If so because of the powerful script, or the fact that it is also its own manager, SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent and impressive movement image and good wording deserves a lot of attention More than you receive. The tiny budget that was on the small studio (this was even before Kaufmann and his friend and partner for more than 30 years, Michael Hartz, who formed the Troma) treated him so well that the film seemed to be more expensive, and in fact he did not have a "low budget" look at all. The story revolves around Camilla Stone (like the mysterious role of Mary Wurono) and her lover, who ended up in circumstances that will not hide the failure to spoil a happy story. This leads to a series of cascading movements, mental games and a loosely inspired character enhancement from Hitchcock's Vertigo, at least in an innovative way. The atmosphere is more gloomy, however, some comparisons come from Nicolas Rogge and Donald Camille. In this mix, there is a very original and innovative animated film that makes it quite unclear how everything will end, along with a superbly synaptic subdivision with a reference to the former Kaufman and unfortunately unavailable FUSS, makes for an hour and a half very exciting. Certainly one of the best films in the Troma Library, is once again one of those films that defy the strange imagination of that its catalog is one of the bad tastes. The DVD features some recent interviews by Kaufman with Woronov and other leading lady Lynn Lowry (later seen in The CRAZIES by George Romero), giving some interesting ideas about what happened during the making of this favorite worship and some hints about what would be different if Lloyd directed it himself . Highly recommended.
