Once a year "comes" a movie like this and makes things easy for you. You have no effort to believe that it is good, it's just something. Enjoy it while watching it, and take it home with you. I can not say it is completely flawless, but it is close. Representation - a great, interesting story with thrilling elements. It is a small family story, very predictable, but not the secret itself. This is how the blind girl takes it. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like very much was the actress who played the mother's role and was extremely cruel and unnecessary. Kirin
