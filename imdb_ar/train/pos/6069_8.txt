....... played Kaddiddlehopper, Colonel San Fernando, etc. The man was very broad and yelling. I love seeing him interacting with Amanda Blake, or without Knots or anyone - he obviously had a ball and I think it made it easier for his guests too - as long as they knew before the time was not disciplined, 19 took some kind of production. Relaxing and comfort was obviously the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of young people like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, and possibly Jerry Lewis as well. The timing is fantastic, and the old hats kept the fans in stitches for decades, just fun about what he was doing. It was a sad little joker who played well - but in an impressive way. <br /> <br /> Personally I think it's great, having just bought a bunch of DVDs from his shows starting in '61 or so, they bring him stuff back in a loving way for me. I can remember seeing him on television at the end of his departure when he was finishing the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Check that out if you're a fan or curious. The riot was.
