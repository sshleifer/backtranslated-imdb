Ti% s and *, lots of boobies. Some of the wonderful, fun-filled characters gathered the teenagers' work in this gradual display of the Amercan Pie franchise. This sounds like a really old school. It's a bit like the Porkys of 2000. Some wonderful funny characters along with some very fun positions make this person a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original actors have finished with one exception, this movie is truly entertaining. Let's not get too excited, you have to take it as a teenaged comedy, but it is superior to what it is. The characters are pet and funny, the girls are hottest than hell. Fun and fun games, with some things I've never seen in comedy, they make me startled but laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore the traders and add this running and see what you are thinking. Do not expect classic American pie, but expect something that would make you laugh and interest you for an hour or so.
