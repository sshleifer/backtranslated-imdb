Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is about to reach puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life - especially involving a boy named Mark (Eliot Spears) who meets him in her dreams. <br /> Fantasy is very unusual with some truly terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and she got a PG-13 rating, this is not for children. Also, if you dislike fantasies stay away. But if you play a game for something different, it fits the bills. <br /> <br /> Directed by Bernard Rose with a good musical score and a few nice and frightening aftershocks. The only thing that prevents this from being a really great film is Burke - she's not a very good actress (not surprisingly this movie is her only movie) and it hurts the film. However, everyone is just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Spiers are very good like Mark; Glenn Headley (rigging the British accent very well) is also very good like Anna's mother and Ben Crosso scary and sympathetic to Anna's father. This is very bad - it's really very good.
