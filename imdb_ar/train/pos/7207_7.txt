I went to Deathtrap and expect a wonderful and interesting stir. And while this is something like this film; I can only think that it is just a poor man. It is clear that the 1972 classic film is an inspiration for this film. Especially with regard to the plot, but certainly with death. Casting Michael Kane in the central role only confirms that. The film is based on a play by Era Levine (who previously wrote Rosemary Pepe and his wife, Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sydney Bruhl, the playwright who was his best day behind. After his latest game bombs, Sydney found himself at a low level; this does not help when playing the Deathtrap game. Written by an amateur who taught him, and reaches the threshold of his house. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and soon Sidney begins hatching his own piece; involving an inviting writer about the amateur writer, killing him, then Deathtrap off of his own work. <br /> <br /> Despite all the clever shifts and turns, Deathtrap is located on one essential element, the characters. The film failed to present one beloved character, and it is very difficult to take care of the story when it does not write any of the players. This does not help with representation. Michael Caen performs as well and as well as you expect, but no one else is proud of him. Christopher Reeve is embarrassed in his role, while Diane Cannon is somehow able to make the beloved single character disgusting through an openly annoying performance. Fortunately the story is good. They are good enough to save the film. The plot is characterized by many twists and turns. Some work better than others, but there's always enough to make sure the movie stays enjoyable. Film director Sidney Lumette deserves some credit, too, because the film's style is a huge plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I must admit I enjoyed this film; but it could have been much better.
