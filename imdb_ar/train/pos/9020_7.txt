The Theory Of Flight is an attractive personal study of a brahan who longs for freedom from boredom and the middle spirit, and a recently ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of ASL, confined in a wheelchair, wants to make love before death. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter exudes intelligence, challenge and independence as an ASL patient who is already dependent on her for her care. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, who was sentenced by community service to co-sponsor, complements Helena's sadness with sad sadness and creates an emotional love story in which two people try to help each other find happiness before time runs out.
