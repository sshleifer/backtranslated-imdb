This must have been one of the best films that came out of Hong Kong a long time ago, I was impatiently waiting to get my hands on this movie just to look at the title. Many wonderful actors in this show, I was especially touched by Sam's unbelievable madness and Edison's portrayal of a deadly machine, which reflected his perfectly normal image. I would definitely recommend to those who are looking for an elegant packed movie and motion. However, I must warn you, it is also frustrating film, since each character in the film is deadlocked and their own problems, struggling for breath. It makes you think about what life is like.
