The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first of all an adult son and his father, but also this son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-biography of his relationship with his father. The film is funny, moving and thought-provoking. This led me to reassess my relationship with both my now deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been better. I hope Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be honored at the film awards next year for their efforts - Valk for his performance and Razer for his text.
