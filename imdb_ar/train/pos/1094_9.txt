This is one of the few comedy films that I can watch over and over again and I still laugh out loud. Elsewhere, I read complaints about racism and sexual discrimination from the right prigs, politically correct. It is not here, unless gender discrimination is defined as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family using a colorful maid. <br /> <br /> The lines were joyful, and not all threads were better. Melvin Douglas is particularly cool. <br /> <br /> If you have thought or tried to build a new home, you will feel relieved to know that no matter how furious the process, no matter how much load wolves may feel, you are not alone!
