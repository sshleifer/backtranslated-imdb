After racism, rural mass migration - also known as rural migration - was another social-political issue in the 1960s. WestSide's story dealt with racism through Valentine's Day from a technical point of view. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural migration through a tragedy of friendship from a psychological point of view. It has a very painful end, where we witness one of my fellow destinies. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger subtly presents the secret ideas, dreams, illusions, fears and assessments of two cities in New York City. While Joe Buck dreams of all the beautiful women in the world to plead with him to share a fantasy love, poor Ratsu Rizo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in Florida's clean and sunny state. Accordingly, he becomes an impostor to turn his imagination into reality; Ratsu becomes a rapper to raise enough funds to migrate to Florida. Besides Ratso helps Joe find his way to do whatever he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, share medicines, share an uninhabited home, share their profits, and share their destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women plead with him to enjoy. Furthermore, Ratsu can not see Florida because his heart failed to defeat his illness while on the bus he was traveling in. <br /> <br /> The Might is always right, and Feeble has no right to daylight. Hence, the "midnight" gives a realistic vision. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no Midrorama at midnight cowboys. Every aspect of every personality is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of the socio-political issue, rural migration.
