"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been a masterpiece for good reason - it's really one of the best films ever produced in America. Both technically valid yet fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when it was first released. But be careful, it's also one of the most sad movies ever produced. The characters are memorable, sophisticated, and ultimately tragic. Directors should be commended for not giving us the end of Hollywood, which was mandatory in the 1980s. However, this is why I cherish the years 1967 to 1977 for the American film. It is a time when dark and innovative films can be produced, and most of all, by the big budgets that Hollywood can offer. All this ended at the time when Star Wars was released. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger's direction makes material work useful. It combines simplicity with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films that show these narcotic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged well. Remains as strong as it was now when it was first released. Representation is what makes this masterpiece. The characters' backgrounds are never completely explained, but the performances make them perfectly sophisticated. Both John Voight and Dustin Hoffman are never forgotten or sympathized (despite their sometimes shameful behavior). In addition, as a fan of old exploits, I liked the scenes on the 42nd Street. "Midnight Cowboy" is nearing perfection and one of the most powerful films ever produced. (10/10)
