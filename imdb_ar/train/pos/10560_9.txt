Jamie Kane is constantly racing your eyes in this story for a theatrical producer struggling hard against the upcoming "talk" movies. <br /> <br /> The story of love, deception, women and dance is presented in such a story the way that you are a viewer never treated a dull moment. The direction of the audience in the rehearsal rooms was very good. The story never got lost in this hectic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material here have become a bit outdated, but that does not matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time frame, it's great to see this alongside many other clouds of movies released during that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a scene for painful eyes in this film, and he never loses his desire as a never-ending producer of previews of movie theaters like intros. This way he tries to save his ass from getting out of work, he was a Broadway producer before he started this. Joan Blondell is as wonderful as Nan interested in abandoned love, and she offers such an extravagant performance of films at the time, it is great to watch a woman portrayed as a powerful woman for change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I faced with the film was mass production at the end. These were fantastic in themselves, beautifully designed and beautifully produced, but they did not seem to fit the story. The only link that connects them to the main story is that Kani had to put 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I have had a hard time believing that this was what the girls were doing during the entire film, and that these groups could fit into the cinema. In this way, "sitting on the backyard fence" was more suited to the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, the production seemed to drag this dangerous story to a halt, and that was not a good thing. I was tired of seeing the first musical sequence and then realized that there were two others going up. These sequences got a lot of bickering from the audience as well. <br /> <br /> All in all is a wonderful film with a sour ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
