First of all, I loved göta kanal 1, it has had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the boat which always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, still acting with the same guy in göta kanal 2 movie but in my opinion Not a funny mania performance as it was in the first film, in fact you do not notice it much at all. The thing that made me think about this movie is the choice of boats, in this film there are only racing boats, it is certainly fast but those do not make waves like the big floating palaces used in the first movie, I loved this movie the best ones, Another of the scenes looks silly when a man suddenly jumps into the canoe to get out of it to evade the "big waves" of those small speedboats. Really minus. You have to accept that we do not live in the same Sweden as in 1974 anymore. This film also contains a bit more violence than the first. Although the film was fantastic in all. I've just focused on some of the drawbacks I was disappointed in, but the rest of the film was on my expectations, so go! It's worth the money.
