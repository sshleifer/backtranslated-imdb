Some may feel that the evaluation I have just made is a bit generous, but as far as this film is concerned I think the directors have done a good job by providing them with, it's also a tasteful film! <br /> <br /> My direct idea was to direct contact with a classic cult film "The Thing," the foreign parasites from outer space, spread over a human host and then destroyed the wreck whenever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film honors this movie and other horror / unfairness, yet intelligently maintains its own authenticity, but these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat and then compete the fallen! Just kill and choose a human when he needs a new host! Then choose another battle with another infected host! Even this film is designed in a love story, but I will not say more than that or else it gives a lot. <br /> <br /> Great! But as I said of the acquired taste, so do not be surprised if you do not like the film. It's a low budget, yes, it's blood thirsty, as foreign beings / creatures turn to their limbs into weapons that look crude, ie saws, drills, blades and even the individual gun of all except competition there. I found myself being exposed to what I see but at the same time lurking on the screen wondering what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you love gore, you love foreigners, love fighting and maybe even a bit of love thrown somewhere, then I should recommend this movie as you should see. I wish I had encountered this earlier then I did!
