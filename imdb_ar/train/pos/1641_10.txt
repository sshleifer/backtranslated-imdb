I've seen this 25 years ago on a TV show. It was very hard to see. Very real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was a heart rupture. There is no time for flirtation: we threw the pot together and put our shoulders on a grater and make it work. This was based on actual women's memoirs, which I read many years later. She said in her memoirs that her parents died when she was small and everyone who bothered them and their sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. I learned to be lazy, which was not like the lady. She was afraid that no magician would want to have a woman with cruel, hard-haired hands, but the husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to cut her, and she was happy. They were both Armenians and worked together to build a new home. So, very sad when the child died. Of course, if they have today, I'm sure it will be fine. This only makes the tragedy very sad. I was crying hard. But then they came out and pulled out with a new wheel successfully. Spring is on its way, and life goes on. In her memoirs, she had two other children and lived.
