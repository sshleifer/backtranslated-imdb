I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the truth about long train travel, bike ride from the train station, soup stalls and other well-illustrated typical scenes, I have certainly added to my appreciation for this film which I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted in bright colors, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Sue's tricks were mostly hidden; I found him highlighting a character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making her sublime, a bit contrived but most tricks directors were so nice that I was completely pulled and just dancing with his characters. Or cried. Or laughed loudly. Wonderful. A +.
