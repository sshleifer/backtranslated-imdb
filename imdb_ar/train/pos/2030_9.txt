The Man from Snowy River II does not reinvent the wheel, but it is a beautiful, crowd-pleasing film that shows some wonderful observations. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River movie hit, (breathtaking scene, sweeping degree, sweet romance and cracking action) this movie truly delivers. This story picks up a few years from the end of the first, and Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been away collecting his fortune in the brood of stock horses. He returns to the place where he stopped with his well-fed Jessica, who is still trying to get out of her tight tits on her feather station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Denney). The frustration of Jim and the character that shakes the plot is the superior snake of the upper class Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eide) who has watched on Jessica. Add to this mix some of the social tension surrounding the property and the horse with a bad attitude from the first film and this is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is acting. Tom Burlinson fits comfortably into Jim's hat cap and a humorous sense of humor. Sigrid Thornton is a beautiful heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on the screen. It will not be easy to fill the hard shoes of Kirk Douglas, and Brian Deney will shout and chant, but he never feels authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is sweeping and fuzzy and the cinema can be the tourist reel of Victoria. However, there are moments of intense indulgence, such as that the director wants only one helicopter shot from another cavalry to show how wonderful the scene is without some personal human drama. There was enough more grit here, we Australian, we can take it! There are some very JAWSish moments with the pharaoh who defies faith. But the funny thing about this film is that in some bright cliches, there are some creative and creative scenes. Jim puts the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before his time) Jim and Jessica stay home, a wonderful scene where Jim shows up riding Alistair with his reliable whip. I can see why this character represents a symbol. <br /> <br /> Overall a very enjoyable sequel. Here is the hope that every person concerned wants to create another work. The man of the third snowy river: Chrysanthemum. I'm sure we all would like to see what Jim and Jessica do at their ranch. <br /> <br /> Aussie DVD contains two additional scenes. Useful if you are already a fan.
