This is not a movie you watch for fun, at least most people I know will not. <br /> <br /> It is a harsh image of both the body and mind that occurs in war well, and the characters seem reasonable, especially because you "read their minds", there is something often in the books and rarely in films, but done well in these Article. I would like to put it next to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Die Br√ºcke" with regard to leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could show it at school, plus the other two films - but finding a copy of it turned out to be very difficult - and that's a shame.
