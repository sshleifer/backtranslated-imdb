HLOTS was a wonderful series, what NYPD Blue would never have, on HLOTS real plots, real dialogue, and real relationships. With the return of HLOTS as a film, tying all the loose ends, it was good to have all the bands back together, so that a few of them had died (I would not say how) the story was fast-paced and emotional and full of soul was serial week in and week off. Killing, street life, network drama at its best! 5 stars!!!! Excellent and all. Thanks NBC for giving us in the end we did not get!
