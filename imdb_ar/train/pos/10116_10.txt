Excellent film and meticulous ... McGovern makes a lot of effort to research and document his writings and bear fruit. He is not afraid to tell the truth, although it may attract unfavorable comments and comments from some who want the stories to be clean, nice and bright. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Ecclestone, although he is not in a high profile role as played in Hillsborough. I found this film as precise, well-represented and well-presented as Hillsborough and I salute McGovern for his scathing writings. Well done and my hat is for the writer, actors and production crew. Wonderful movie!
