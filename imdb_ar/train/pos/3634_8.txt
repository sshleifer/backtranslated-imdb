I had low expectations for this film, but I was looking for something I would not challenge in the evening. I came out of the theater quite pleased and was somewhat surprised. It's a great baseball tribute movie, a great lesson about following your dreams. Dennis Quid is a brilliant performer through his role and has been influenced by his performance. Definitely worth the full price ticket and two hours of your time!
