The story revolves around Ankosh (Abhay Deol) - a professional marriage witness, in short, acting as a witness to couples in the Marriage Registration Office - and Megha (Suha Ali Khan) who fled her home in Nainital to marry her. Love interest of the turf (Xi'an Munshi). The story begins with a megaphone waiting at the marriage registration desk until it shows a turret, but for some reason it does not show up. So Ankosh comes in the picture here, which approached Mega with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for the post of his witnesses and ends up helping her to provide shelter for her. Ankosh is in love with Mega and she is also in love with him (or some kind of love). Both agree to marry and return to the picture. Unexpected circumstances occur, in fact I must say, the expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then .... <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of the film is a bit different from the films we see and I do not think this will be accepted by the masses , But if you are obsessed with me like me and would like to see something different, you will definitely love the movie. The film is just an innocent love story by Abhay Deol and Suha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel as though things are happening to the next guy. Play background music for the film also very good role, they are very good. The Delhi view is very good and gives a new feeling. <br /> <br /> So let's cut it down and sum it up. <br /> <br /> Story: A very common story that was performed very well turned into a great experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, it was also produced by Hamesh Rishamaya, so I did not expect much but I still loved two songs of the film including Qawwali. <br /> Representation: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent but must stay away from singing in the songs. Suha Ali Khan, is a doll, very nice doll I have to say. Again the innocent and natural representation of these two players fit perfectly with their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may have few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other representatives did their work well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I will also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie if you see in the theater, I recommend watching it in the theater if you are a strange film and accept uncommon stories. Wait for DVD access only. The film will certainly not be loved by the masses and the work it can do is publicity.
