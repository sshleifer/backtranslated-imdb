Red Eye is a good short story to watch on Saturday night. Great representation, great wickedness and unpredictable movement. <br /> <br /> Some people may not want to watch this movie because it spans 85% and 88% of the movie on board and speaks only. No need to worry that it works very well through the smart and intelligent dialog box. <br /> <br /> PG-13 seems to be a new ground for director Wes Craven. But he certainly absorbed as much violence as possible in this thrilling story. <br /> <br /> The strongest point in these films is her team. This film needed good actors to present dialogue and excitement. If they did not have these actors, the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams of average girls and wedding smashes. Celian Murphy of Batman begins 28 days later. This actor is Brian Cox from X-men 2. <br /> <br /> The speed in this film was great. Just when you think about going to boredom they throw a twist at you. Fortunately, this film is not long and does not seem so. Much better than Flight Flight Movie Plan. <br /> <br /> Here's my flight plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too long. <br /> <br /> 8/10
