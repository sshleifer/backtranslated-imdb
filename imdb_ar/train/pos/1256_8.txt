This is a very exciting and interesting movie. There are many plots and turns. The story or director opens question marks on the death row or alleged crimes committed by blacks. This film by Arnie Gleacher is well done and the wonderful sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this, do not miss "real crimes" or "Huri". My wife and I gave 8/10.
