Sixty-five years have passed since the last production was produced in Thalberg. But my fellow IMDB members, come on, this movie is definitely a masterpiece of the thirties! This is the first film I saw at the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). After looking at the scenes of this poverty, it was brilliantly filmed, often exciting, and always attractive, for me MGM was making the film at its best. What the public felt when they looked at the locust attack, the person who destroyed the palace, the terrible poverty and the wealth of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, Oscar winners had a glimpse of the Oscar-winning "High" Oscar Louise Rainer. It is great to see an actress who has undoubtedly made one of the most ingenious and playful performances in history that she has chosen to return to celebrate. <br /> <br /> Well, so she should not have won the previous year (Great Ziegfeld) but do not blame Lewis. The debate was only a decade old when it was issued, and its dialogue was limited. But as a couple, their use of visual and acoustic is memorable. <br /> <br /> On a large scale and touching, what can film lovers do more!
