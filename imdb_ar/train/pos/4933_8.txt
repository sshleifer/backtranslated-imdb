Refreshing 'lost' gem! Characterized by effective dialogue with excellent representation to establish personalities and involve you enough to take care of what happens to them. The characters Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Balance is his usual evil existence. Widmark wins the fighting scene, chasing the car for less than 60 seconds by the end of the "boogie", and chasing the long-shabby walk on the contemporary Hollywood chase chains. You know how you will most likely end up, but the thrill and attention goes on all the time. End of the chase is one of the most realistic you'll ever see. The film seems to slow a bit in the middle, but stays with it in the end.
