I can not believe a movie can be good in 1987 which is almost unknown in the West. Do not repeat other reviews here. The result is very good and moving. Literally means "Dawn Please never come" - When it comes, the beautiful ghost and lover will be separate forever. Twenty-four years later, Joel and Leslie are still wonderful. I enjoyed Joel the Good of Gambers and many of Leslie's films including Better Tomorrow.
