Directed by Rogerio Diodato, a real icon of many horror-loving filmmakers after he took out the famous Knepol Holocaust. However, do not expect to find any of this bad reputation in the movie reviewed here because it proves to be incredibly tame compared to playing more like a Conan-inspired stroll for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description may have been immediately put off by most fans of the entire Sword & Sorcery group inspired by Conan, but before you are interested in this, it must be said, this movie is very fun! <br /> <br /> It is often played in order to laugh and distinguishes two of the huge and very beloved heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. Berber brothers who seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch, B-Movie's favorite, has emerged as the main villain in the piece, and it is also wonderful to see the roles of George Eastman and Michael Periman. <br /> <br /> In addition, women are astonished to have them wearing proper clothing throughout the film period (a key element and much welcomed in this genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say, - This is simply a really fun and fun take on this kind and I recommend wholeheartedly!
