This film is very interesting, and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not film quality. Unlike the common hieroglyphs in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great way to humor. It has some good special effects, and exciting motion scenes. <br /> <br /> As a search for lost children, Murphy begins to search for a missing girl, leading him on the path that others believe was "chosen" - to protect the golden child. The little boy was born as an enlightened cross, destined to save the world from the forces of evil, but his life was in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and a beautiful, mysterious and mystical assistant / counselor. <br /> <br /> Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge members of the public interested in meditating on deep thoughts. One of these scenes is the test of the golden child, who seeks the character of Murphy to protect him, by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a set of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the baby is tested upon his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fictional story / comedy based on the idea that both are good and evil forces in our world which most people are not fully aware of. While accepting the premise of this conspiracy, we must abandon our touch with the imagined daily reality, prepare for the earth and the walls to collapse away, and reveal the world of evil that awaits us only to destroy us. <br /> <br /> This excellent film, with a good plot, good acting, and decent dialogue most often combines a serious theme with a healthy balance of martial arts fighting, and Eddie Murphy's humor.
