In Iran, women are officially banned from sporting events for men. In June 2005, Iran played an important match against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium to qualify for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and football fans like boys and failed attempts to enter the stadium being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo team), beach and movies are my greatest passion; so I liked this little jewel around a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi of The White Balloon, The Mirror and The Circle filmed the film on the day Iran beat Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the coolest films I have ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): Not available
