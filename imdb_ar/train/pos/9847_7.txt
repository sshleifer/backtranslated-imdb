I enjoyed watching this movie .. Despite the feeling that I got a lot of time, this movie was almost copied by Monsters Inc. Small children, other animals are trying to break this relationship, and so on. I felt this pretty much throughout the film, for me. <br /> <br /> Despite that, Scrat :) is a very funny character, even if it serves no purpose :)
