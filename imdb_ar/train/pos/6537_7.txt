I liked the kids I took into this film (four children aged 9-12 years and they would get 10 stars). Emma Roberts was a star performer. (Expecting to see more of the next generation of Roberts in the future). After being exposed more than others to Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not look as if she were working in the streets. I also enjoyed the support of Tate Donovan, Rachel Lee Cook, Barry Postwick and Monica Parker (with Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: A nice movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the book series, so my comments are based on the movie's merits.)
