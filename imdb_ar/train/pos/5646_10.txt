Recently when I was shopping, I saw a group of American Gothic, I thought "I remember it!" I used to set the alarm clock on backup and watch it when I was in CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30 am (I was 14). I remember that mostly because it was scary and really strange, no one was so scary as Lucas Buck (with character B !!) was not anyone at all. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was that they did the same on the TV box as on the TV. The episodes in a funny arrangement, I kept thinking when Dr. Matt left ??? - They made it very confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of writers, producers or directors (TV people in the background are money makers who still do the same thing - just look at programs like Carnivale and Farscape They do not like originality in the studios! !!!!) <br /> <br /> To the end - if you do not see this and call yourself into science fiction, horror, and supernatural drama .. you wonder = you should. They even said the same thing in SFX when browsing a group box.
