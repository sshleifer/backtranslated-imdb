This one has a lot going on - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and less amount of manure - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little hum - Kelly. It was the first real movie for Sinatra, where the product was spent product and I could see it on the screen (it was previously shown in two low-budget, "high and high" and "top step") but if they rely only on Sinatra tubes and Grayson patches In addition to the three-tone pianos we left with Iturbe, we left with a tougher film and a better display of Sinatra. Because he records all his songs from the duo with Kelly - we hate to leave, I begged her - to his own solos, what makes the sunset, and the magic you and I fall in love also easily. Although this move is still alive Sinatra's best musical of the 1940s on the tenth budget.
