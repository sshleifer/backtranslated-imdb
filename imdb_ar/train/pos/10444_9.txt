(1995), the third film by Richard Linkler, dedicated to everyone who was in love, in love, or never in love, but still dreaming of him and hoping To find it. It is one of the most rare films that / should / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple film without any visual effects, car chases or long, lively sex scenes. Two young men in their early twenties and two university students (the American tourist Ethan Hawk returning home after summer in Europe and French student Julie Delby, who is going to Paris to attend courses at the Sorbonne) are on a train. They are attracted to each other immediately even before they start talking, and they stand outside the train in Vienna, wandering around the city for the whole night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, this is the movie. It could have been boring and silly, but instead, it's a beautiful, honest, intelligent and moving love story that only gets better with every watch (at least for this scene). A high tribute and sincere praise to the director and writers for their two charming personalities, brilliant writing, interesting dialogues always ingenious, two brilliant performances, and a magic atmosphere that falls in love. Julie Delby, who looks like a Botticelli angel, is wonderful at portraying a young intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive.
