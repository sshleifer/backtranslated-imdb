In Micro Phonies the officers are at their best. In this short, the three workers work in a recording studio. They ended up having a look at Alice Van Doreen (Christine McIntyre) singing in the spring voice. The stunning sound of Mrs Bixby (Simona Boniface) hears curly in the clouds. Mo calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. And ends up going to the three parties where Curly will wear clothes. They play a record with the sounds of spring and all things go well until Mo destroys the record on a curly head. They end up using a lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes it and separates it. Alice Van Doreen was screaming and hiding behind a curtain to help them. All is well until Baritone wonders how Kirley sings without the help of a phonograph discovers Alice behind the curtain has been revealed the three sexes in the scams but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees to become a singer has been tossing the rib outside the room. Excellent.
