I have never heard of this, despite his association with George Clooney (who produced his company and appeared in the form of very funny support) and his Pacific director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we chose this in a discount box for $ 4.99 (CAD in it!) What a great surprise and fun. But then I see that if William H. Messi where you will not feel disappointed. This reminded us of comedy Ealing from England in the 1950s. Well, with more profanity. This eccentric movie is sometimes a funny film. The actual robbery made me laugh hard I was crying. Perhaps the most extreme use of lingerie in the film's history. Maybe these expectations were low, but I watched with a group of people and talked about an explosion. The best $ 5 I've spent in ages.
