After watching this movie, I feel I know more about USA. David Lynch is synonymous with the value of shock and strange in the way of strangeness, and these elements in fact are not missing from the straight story. However, in light of I have not seen of Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but in the end with a group of silly interesting characters with a depth in their lives can not be clear from their submission. The move was particularly a bar scene with two World War II veterans discussing events that occurred fifty years ago and how it still affects their current lives and emotions. If you're looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is the right movie for you.
