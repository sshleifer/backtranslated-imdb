This documentary was nominated for the Academy Award and it is easy to find out why. Even after 45 years, it is an impressive work. Why not be in print a mystery can only be explained to Disney. Good use of live footage and animation side by side. This was running as part of "Disney Vault" every few months or so, but I have not seen them listed for a long time. * Sigh * the most recommended.
