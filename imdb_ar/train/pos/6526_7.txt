I always enjoyed watching this when I appeared on TV at peak times every year in the 1960s. It's a typical Hollywood epic, a play, full of mistakes, but what's more, it's an armed film and a good-looking film. Cecil B. Demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law Anthony Quinn, who had a supporting role for Pelucci in '38 ', is the director of the first director and song of a swan he has never released before and will never repeat. DeMille has recently assembled a crew on its Decalogue to help Quinn abandon it including the producer / co-actor of DeMille's longtime Henry Wilcoxson project supervisor. Among other ten commandments, scriptwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, second director Arthur Rosson, two artistic directors Walter Hull and Hal Pereira, a group of directors Sam Kummer and Ray Muir, designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Moyer Lester, who as a design team received his nomination for the Oscars. A great team here from DeMille headed by Jules Brenner as pirates Jean Lafitte and Charlton Heston as future president of General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast is Charles Bauer, e. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Ingres Stevens. In just over two hours, it pulls in some locations but makes up for some excellent battle scenes. I'll give it 7.5 out of 10.
