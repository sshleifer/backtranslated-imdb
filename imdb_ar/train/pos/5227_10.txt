Men in White is one of the most entertaining, if not the most entertaining, comedy films. (I've seen so much!) It's about two men in suitcases who become "men in white" and then stop the invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic films, such as Men in Black, Star Wars or Dr. Strangelove. Anyone who says that this crappy film has something wrong in his head. There are lots of funny jokes and jokes here, and you may actually get your mouth to laugh hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - definitely will not regret it!
