In my humble opinion, this film has not earned the recognition it deserves. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, in Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and that was my favorite. I'm sorry because more people do not appreciate it. My grandmother read a book and read the book years before he appeared on the big screen. She gave me a reading after we saw the film together. The film and the book hit an emotional spot inside my heart, and I was crying for several days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to prevent our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, but our love, our families and their stories last for generations. "But when I am alone in half the light of the valley, all existence seems to fade with my being with my soul, my memories, the sounds of the Big Black Foot, the rhythm of four numbers, the sound of my life, And the river passes through the river was flooded by the great floods in the world and extends over the rocks from the vault of time, and in some rocks are eternal drops of rain, under the rocks words and some words their words. " . These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (by Robert Redford, who tells Norman McLean), are basically a Bible, in my opinion. Any potential flaws in the film have been overshadowed by the beauty and grace of story and cinematography. It was nice!
