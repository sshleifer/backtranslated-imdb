I say that the domino principle is a film that is not much appreciated. He has spent a lot of time exploring our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace. In fact, many others can deduce that the author of dominoes was just a principle that really knew what he was talking about. Troy Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sirhan Sarhan or Arthur Bremer may be even John Hinckley or Timothy McVeigh. To mention some of the conspiracy scenarios involving spies, big businesses and political assassinations is not a fantasy, but a sinister part of our complex existential history. God helped us, but the dominoes principle is more than fiction. If this caused a little loss of sleep, perhaps you should not take my words for it, investigate for yourselves.
