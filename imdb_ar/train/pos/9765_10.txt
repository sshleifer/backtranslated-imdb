I saw this little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when it was aired on CBS. I did not know it was in a theater at all. To evaluate it from the point of view of children, I will give it 4 out of 5 stars, because I was young at the time, looked a bit "my daughters." <br /> <br /> The climate scene where the Gazooks was tickling in broad daylight from everyone was a little annoying at the time but you outperform this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I re-discovered a Blockbuster video in 1995, I had to reconsider it! I still love it even though it looked a little "old". I do not know where the other reviewer got the idea that he was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It exists. Maybe it's on a DVD now, at least I wish it was. I want to share it with my children someday! 10 stars here, still a great movie for kids. (End) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found the VHS version !! Wu Hoo!
