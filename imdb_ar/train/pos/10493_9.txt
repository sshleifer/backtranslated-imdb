This film is a source of inspiration for anyone who is very busy, financially or emotionally. You will certainly laugh, the best medicine! Grace was left in a bad financial position when her husband died, she had to find a new way to earn some money, and that was not entirely legal which adds to the sense of humor. Even my friend loved him, so do not think he squeaked.
