Has this surrounding production failed to achieve its fundamental goal of adapting Allende's novel correctly? Of course yes. Bille August produced a shallow surface film where the essential elements of South American mentality are presented as side events, leading to total inconsistency. I can not believe that there is a whole production team could not understand the book! Of course, there is technical quality in this film and I think the actors did their best with what they have in their hands, but there is something missing. This thing was the most important part.
