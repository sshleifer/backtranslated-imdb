It is a great American martial arts film. The scenes of the fighting were impressive for the American film produced in the 1990s. Of course, fighting scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong films, in fact there are only a few American films that have good fighting scenes such as Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. When you watch an American martial arts film, you expect to see less impressive fighting scenes, but you still have some wonderful moves, which may be surprisingly good at times, or at least that's what I expect from these films. I was impressed by this film. Some of the scenes of the fighting were really impressive. The acting, directing and plot were good enough, so it's worth watching movies if you like American martial arts in the 1990s.
