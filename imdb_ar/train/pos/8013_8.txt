Yes, it is another wonderful Muppet magic film and I love them all. Characters, films and television shows (it's the best comedy program or television show ever) and all the artists who stand behind it. But here they made a terrible mistake rarely and I certainly talk about the strange end !! <br /> <br /> I think it is very dangerous to involve so much in the American drama and end the relationship of love with marriage !! We, like all poor viewers, feel free or perhaps happy to have no discomfort, distress and misery! So we all enjoy these stories that bring together gentle heroes as a couple in love without a legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Superman, Louis Lane, Dick Tracy, Tess, etc. So with all the former couples and their likes, I bet on it feel safe, serenity and peace. So when you look at what the makers of this movie have already done, you will be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> They have made the poor creature Kermit get married from his daily nightmare, the most disturbing women ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change by the standards of the American entertainment industry! It was natural to have a negative impact on the public who just refused to bless, believe or accept this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the opportunity to think or make a decision!). So it's no wonder when you know that this is the most failed film in his serious film, with a total of 25 million to 65 million earned from the first film The Muppet Movie (1979) five years ago !! <br /> <br /> Simply in this movie, they took Manhattan, and also my leg!
