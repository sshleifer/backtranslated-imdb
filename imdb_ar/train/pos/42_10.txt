Phillips has put busy in hell one of the performances, both comic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but the busy man stole the show. It was a nice touch after the movie The Smokers, which was a busy title, and it was not great. If you do not get busy filtering of any kind for this movie would be a disaster. Forget the smile Mona Lisa, see the house room.
