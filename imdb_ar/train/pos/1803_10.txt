My dog ​​recently died, and this was a movie I loved when I was a kid, so I had to watch it in an attempt to express joy. <br /> <br /> (Watch out for dogs, I mean spoilers). This film is not intended for children and is far from normal. He was appointed to New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog was not portrayed as an additional family member in this film, but as an adult with his own complex life. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not much different from his evil and brutal partner, Carves. He is driven by money, greed, and has just escaped execution, as he mentioned at the beginning of the feature. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Ann Marie and his intimate, bearded. Carvis will not listen to the ugly dog ​​with the big cups that happens to be closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carvis is trying to kill the hero, because he wants 100% of profits in their business and will settle only 50% - an unusual way for the German sponsor to die. Also, a crocodile from prehistoric crocodiles who ends up avoiding your life because you can sing is very unlikely whether you are a dog or not. This is a cartoon and that's why it makes sense here. <br /> <br /> Carface's way of revenge is through murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge and financial success. After he escaped death, he started a business by getting Carface, a very talented girl with the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole set of races, and Charlie tells her he will give the money to the poor - a hint: Charlie and Eche live in a horse farm, so they are poor. He uses money towards the casino / bar / theater, not the other "poor". The reason Anne Marie's ability to speak to animals is that she has compassion, and she listens carefully. She teaches Charlie's ethics by referring to gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to compensate her by buying her clothes. He added the ethics he needed to do, Charlie did the job, and Etti provided the building. <br /> <br /> Carvis uses violence and destruction of property to destroy Charlie's work, which is not protected by the government. Charlie loses everything and all that remains is this little girl. In the end he had to choose between her life and his life. Is the first to pay attention to self-preservation, and put it when the girl began to drown. Both the girl and the watch were drowning, and he had to choose either, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> Much of this film, which focuses on a person's ability to learn correctly from error over time, and the child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of their pet's death, is that it never shows anyone's death! The clock symbolizes his life, and the hour appears submerged and stopped. All deaths were suggestive, even for the wicked. I did not cry during this film so far, and I came out so much that I had to write it and share it with you.
