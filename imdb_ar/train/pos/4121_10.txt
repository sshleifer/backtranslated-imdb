This person tends to underestimate many critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was fantastic. It is a cross-sectional study of the poorest of Tokyo, living in a city literally made of garbage. Although it looks like just a bomb, the film enjoys a quiet beauty thanks to the great use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound made by the crazy young man who drives a fake cart across slums. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories were full, but perhaps the most tragic of them was the man and his little son who lived in a deserted car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build the house of their dreams. Moving and emotional movie.
