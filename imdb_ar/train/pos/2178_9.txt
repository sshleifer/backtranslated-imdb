With plenty of sunlight, gauze light and shadows filtering through the windows into the rooms, tracking the footage that travels through the crowds using a handheld camera, and quick editing and recordings very close here and there, photography is an interesting thing in this area, done. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie begins as a little fuzz about the beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the beautiful Lucienne named Louz Brooks - a little confrontation in front of the men walking by the swimming pool, and soon decide to enter France to compete in the Miss Europe contest, , Stuck to the mud (a very annoying fellow, really). When you walk on the runway, the 10 contestants show themselves in the swimsuit, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who gets the longest applause (I was wondering, girls can not move more slowly to prolong their length - and therefore applause - on the platform ?!). Soon Amir and Maharaja chase Lulu, but his lover does not like the attention other men or her fans give her (I think he only wants her at home, cooks his meals, and stay out of sight, eh?). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, and her presence helps in promoting this film, but it's really the way she was portrayed that made my interest more. A little distracting is the strange dubbed sound, which is a bit off. The print on this version looked very clear and filled with nice contrast though. When I watched this, I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the movie visually, and found the movie excellent and worth watching.
