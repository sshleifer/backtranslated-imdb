This film has scared me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother was watching him when he was back in 92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with her hand as her father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She was saying something like "Do not let me understand" or something like that. I asked what made her feel very upset and told me she was watching The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> Obviously I had to watch it and although I was only eleven, I was allowed to do so. She scared me. I've been safe from horror movies since watching this!
