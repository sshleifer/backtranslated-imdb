A wonderful movie with a slow start - give him a chance to get cooking. The story builds in attention and complexity. The characters and the storyline spoil expectations and appear at all the right moments. New York City's magnificent and real sites are a great antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the entire film is a hurdle to the HBO / Hollywood concept of New York City, sex and relationships. It is a rare film that treats its characters honestly and compassionately. loved it! With fantastic performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and attention to her love (I forgot his name!).
