Vanilla Sky is a remake in 2001 for the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). In my opinion, a more humane and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays the role of David Aimes, Ananius Anani takes others' feelings as a matter of course, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays the role of Brian Shelby, David's best friend, and often, he's the only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, who accompanies him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays the role of Julie Gianni, a fellow of David at times. Kurt Russell plays the role of Dr. Curtis Maccabe, a psychologist in an interview with David. All their interactions, and their consequences, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex novels ever. I will no longer explain the plot, because it is more urgent, the least you know. Ignoring all the people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you are interested, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but it is not confusing. In my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
