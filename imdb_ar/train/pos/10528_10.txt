I was very impressed with the Jane McGrath version of Jane Austen's "Emma", and I liked Rachel Portman's musical score so much that when I went to the video store one day and discovered that the two had reunited, Nicholas Niklipi hired him immediately without any other consideration . <br /> <br /> I have read this book, and for those who are overly critical of this amendment to Jane Austen, I do not know what McGrath could do to capture the spirit and the key elements of Miss Austin's work better, especially given the limitations on A two-hour movie (which some complained was too long!). As far as Gwyn Paltrow is concerned, I must admit that I did not know her well when I first saw it in the theater, and I was quite convinced then that she was an English actress! <br /> <I was surprised by those who criticized the film because of its fertile scenery. This is one of the things I enjoy and I look forward to seeing it in the parts of the period set in the English countryside. Beautiful film backgrounds are a major contributor to its attractiveness and success. If your idea of ​​flight fare is something more gloomy, you might have to rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the staff, and are combined with story and soundtrack entertainment that makes you not tired of repetitive views. McGrath is intrigued when designing the interaction between subtle expressions that are absolutely necessary in conveying complex romantic plots that occur in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing film can also be a clinic about how fun a movie minus sex, violence or even a wicked deduction. The story is often entertaining, affectionate and sometimes touching. <br /> <br /> I have seen many modifications to the works of Jane Austen's book, but this is definitely my favorite.
