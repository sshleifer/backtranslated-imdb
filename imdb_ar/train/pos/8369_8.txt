Hrm - I think this line was from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie that seems to have been translated from some languages ​​that were not quite familiar to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie starts with a black screen and reads the text "In the future ..." would be fun. This means that the hypothesis is so unreasonable that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "in the future" means that instead of fighting wars, countries have men who sneak into giant robots and pin them down to determine them. Well, this is not entirely clear, but it is probably something important Oh really. There are good people (obviously they are capitalists, ie we) and Commies! There are big robots to stop the movement. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effects budget was very small, so we do not get a lot of great robots. There are plenty of interior scenes with a cheap appearance, then fighting a large area near the finish. The space battle is particularly nice, because it does not specifically serve any purpose other than the remaining blow from the budget influences. <br /> <br /> With the money now spent, the climate fight turns to (and I do not do it) two players hitting each other with sticks. I can always laugh at a bar by re-activating the final scene, completing the last line that guarantees leaving any audience scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said, he is stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
