In 1958, Clarksburg was a famous speed trap town. A lot of revenue was generated by a sheriff's department in catching drivers. Who tried to bypass Sharif? Well, this gave Sheriff a chance to keep them away from Clarksburg Curve with the Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, two soldiers were pushed on leave trying to return to base on time until their death, if I remember correctly. Then one day, a stranger went to the city. Probably the coolest cool rodder in the world. Michael McCord. So his name is the name of the car, as in the McCord gaskets. Perhaps the ultimate hot rod. Black Flaming '34 Ford Coupe. The colors of death, evil and hell. Gets picked up for speed by the sheriff on purpose. It checks the status of the earth. He is the brother of a victim of Sharif. He knows how his brother died. Clarkesberg government supports Cherif. There is only one way to bring justice to kill his brother and fix things, "this will never happen again to anyone": re-establish the chase and settle the method of hot competitions to death. Come out to the curve and practices. Sharif knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... This movie is remembered by anyone who tried to control the maneuver along a certain route.
