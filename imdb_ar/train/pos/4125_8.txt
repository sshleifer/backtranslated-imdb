I loved watching 'Sea Hunt' again in the day, I was at the grammar school and back home to do my homework, and by 4:30 pm I would be ready to watch 'Sea Hunt' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. loved it ! It took you to an unattainable place at that time, under the great blue sea. Before "Thunderball" or even before becoming a popular Cousteau, there was Mike Nelson who raised the imagination of children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children have developed their passion for oceanography, biology or science to see this show. Underwater photography also offers, the magic of exploration is easily stimulated by watching this show. Watch and enjoy!
