As a person who sought to exist as a "professional" person with an income supported by a Bachelor of Chemistry and an MBA, he was always rationally engaged in outdoor indulgences in more artistic things. My classes after graduation were always supported emotionally and spiritually by interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal forging / welding and artistic painting, which also included a silk show. <br /> <br /> I also stay in good health with jogging, walking and recently hiking to distant destinations in California and neighboring states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking make one close to the ground with time to stop, watch, listen and also photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> Within that background, I was obsessed with River and MPs. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of Andy Goldsworthy and with the skill and smoothness of director / cinematographer Thomas Redlsheimer. In fact I could not separate the Goldsworthy art with the Riedelsheimer camera path. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. Wonderful. Wonderful.
