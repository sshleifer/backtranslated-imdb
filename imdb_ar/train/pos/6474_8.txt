I was totally attracted to this and could not wait for each episode. Representation has revived the emotional life of the missing person in the family, as well as the effects it may have on those closest to him. The only problem we encountered as a family was the speed with which everything was finally explained. We could not hear what was said clearly and we had no idea of ​​Gary's role in everything? Why did Kyle call him and why did he approve him? After we invested in a five-hour series, we felt cheated because only five minutes were left to seal. I asked about him and none of my friends who saw him was even wiser. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
