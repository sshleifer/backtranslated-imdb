Satisfaction of a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Islamic heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. On the blue side, his father declares that Reza will lead him to Hajj (Hajj) to Mecca - something that does not satisfy his satisfaction but only agrees to be bound. As a result, from the beginning, he is angry but as a traditional Muslim man, it is difficult for his father to talk to him or discuss his fears. Both father and son seem rigid and inflexible - which is very ridiculous when the father tells his son that he should not be too stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, he talks about how many characters have grown up and started to know each other. However, I do not really think they did this, and this is a stunning and sad aspect of the film. Sure, there have been times of understanding, but often there was a hidden hostility and repression. I really liked this, and I appreciate that there was not a complete solution to this - because it seemed a lie. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is good-looking and wonderful - giving the Westerners an unusual view of Islam. And pilgrimage. It also provides a wonderful tradition of traditional Islam and a secular young generation. While the slow pace of blurring the relationship between all over the film has annoyed some, I think it gave the film a real realism and made it look like a movie about people - not some formula. Beautiful and unusual film.
