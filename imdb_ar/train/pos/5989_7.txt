The film begins with a group of children at the School of Reform focusing on a child named "Gaby," who apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabi and his sister move to a new neighborhood to start a new beginning, and soon meet Gabi with the children of the dead. The children in this film are small villains, but they are much less anti-social than they were in other previous films and in their depths, they are bad guys with good intentions. However, there are also some criminals in the neighborhood who commit insurance fraud through arson and see Gabi as an appropriate scapegoat - after all, he has been to reform the school and no one believes he is innocent once he is surrounded. So when Gabi is ready to send him back to the Big House, it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks. <br /> <br /> The movie "Dead End" appeared in many Warner Bros films in the late 1930s, movies were generally very good (especially angels with deadly faces). However, after the expiry of the children's contracts, they went to the Monogram studios and the films, she said, were very weak and complex - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being the complete show and the group being renamed The Boy Baori. Because ANGELS WASH THE FACES had excellent writing and production values, and Hall and Gorcey did not dare to camera continuously, it's a very good movie - and got about 7 points (it's very close). In fact, although this film is not aesthetically great, it is certainly a lot of fun to watch, so I will give it 7! She was certainly an enormous child - especially when the children took the law into their own hands and Reagan ignored the Bill of Rights - but he was also very fun. The Dead End Kids offers their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Anne Sheridan offer excellent support. Sure, this part of the film was illogical and impossible, but in a way it was still funny and rather charming - so if you can comment on disbelief, it works well.
