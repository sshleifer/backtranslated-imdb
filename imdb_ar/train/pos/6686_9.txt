This film was a wonderful concept. It was original and intelligently written and highly attractive to those of us who are not actually picking up "identical" films. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies that have a lot of appeal, but when you go to see a "everybody else watching" movie - you know you're either twins or you do not really have an opinion. This was a beautiful sense of humor - although most people probably only look at what is obvious. The actors filmed their characters naively and I think there is a much more "personal" character in this film. He has a call for children as well as adults. Spain. It's good to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and drug hints! Fantastic film, not ignored on the basis of public consumption. This is a must buy.
