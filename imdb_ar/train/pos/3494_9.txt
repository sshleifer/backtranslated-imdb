For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is as close to perfect as a movie can get. Either the genius of a newborn author or just one of those lucky ones blending where we all agree (perhaps some of them), this simple ethnic first love in a slice of urban life embodies his little characters with such depth that you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong flavor of "the street", but goes on to a family relationship with the Latins, then focuses on a story that speaks volumes about the youth's uncertainty and the deep natural desire to love someone else. In my experience, not much was done with the little (cast of the turquoise, novice director, etc.). Praised by critics but not for everyone, "Victor Vergas" is recommended for Indie and realistic lovers in simple tales rich in humanity. (a)
