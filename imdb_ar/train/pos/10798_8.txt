I first saw this gem of Joe Sarno on my way back when, I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Wells. At first I thought the movie was moving a little slower than I expected for the movie Sarno, but when Jennifer entered it, the first time I saw it anywhere, I sat down and took my attention. Difficult to avoid their presence in this film, seasoning each scene involved. I have watched most of the other Sarno movies, other films starring or with Jennifer Wells, and I must say that this was Sarno and Jennifer at their best collective. The direction of Sarno In this film of the local drama Gorgeous adults, Jennifer (figuratively and literally) showed the ingenuity that makes this a must see. Rebecca Brooke (star Mary Marius) and Chris Jordan, both frequent stars of Willis, as well as the recurring stars of Sarno's work, are participating in certified performances as a pair of adventurous housewives, but primitives. This film is the classic Sarno.
