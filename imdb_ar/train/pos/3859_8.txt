Paul Verhoeven is De Vered Mann (The Fourth Man), one of the most exciting stories I have ever seen. It was really a pleasant surprise. The story relates to the bi-gender writer Gerard (Geron Krabi), because he is seductive to having a relationship with a beautiful hairdresser Christine (Rene Sutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerrard, there may be more story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and deadly sexual images. This really attracts you to the story, and you do not want to watch it, but you can not keep yourself away. This is the best film for Verhoeven (probably second only to Robocop). It's true that the fourth man is not for everyone, some sex scenes are completely rewarding (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch at least 10 minutes, you'll be hooked.) That's one of those movies you need to know how it ends. , Convincing, controversial, and exciting.I love even borrowing the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
