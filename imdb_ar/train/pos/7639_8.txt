It's not a big movie. The representation is not amazing (some sub-tenants play badly), and the film is not beautiful in any way. Nothing really innovative or new. If you love big movies, this is not for you. However, it has been great - very big in the story. Larry's story works, because we know this story from our lives. The girl we have not yet asked, the test we failed, and the friend we have failed, are all in our history. This film works, because it touches it, it is a wonderful story because it is a small story. It is the life we ​​all enjoy, with the regret we all enjoy. Yet the message strikes: Every life we ​​could live would have borne its negative aspects. The first time I saw her, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a party in my school. After 16 years, I still think about it once every time, and every time I see it, I put a smile on my face. See this. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
