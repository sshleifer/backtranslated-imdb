It is true that you always remember what you were doing when a disaster or tragedy occurred. Nothing more on September 11, 2001, the date that changed the whole world scene in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary has not been explored that will review the events that led to 9/11. Instead, the directors, the brothers Gideon and Jules Naudette, have been preparing a documentary about the trials of a firefighter in New York . They went to the academy and did some drills and chose their own "siren" (firefighters under surveillance) to join them in a fire in New York, home to Lade 1 and Engine 7. But their production was for development and containment at the time, believed to be the only shot of the first invading aircraft Global Tracking Center. <br /> <br /> I was traveling with a friend on the train from one of the LAN games, and I received a call at about 850 pm local time from my father who informed me of the above. After a few minutes, he told me that there was another, and that the World Trade Center was under attack. By the time I got home, the upper floors of the twin towers and the smoke had burst into flames, and I realized, they had collapsed, less than an hour. <br /> <br /> The directors had two cameras working that day, one of which followed a team in a routine call, and immediately rushed to the World Trade Center when they heard and saw the crash. We follow what is the only possible sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters, paramedics and police understood what had happened and quickly developed a plan of action. The other camera, carried by the other brother, was on its way to the World Trade Center to look for his brother. Throughout the trip, he picked up many New Yorkers' expressions, as well as a sense of chaos inside and around Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The documentary features numerous interviews with men from Salam 1 and Engine 7, who have not suffered from any miraculous victim. But being survivors also caused a range of mental disorders, struggling to cope with the event. Through the unfolding events, we recognize the intimate friendship between these men who risk life and everyday parties in their jobs, to save lives. <br /> <br /> We started with what was supposed to be the documentary, before the events of the day swung into full focus and into the rescue phase where the men who worked around the clock were hoping to find survivors under the rubble to understand the steel structures Fading. It is not a fabricated film, and what you see here can not be reproduced in any other documentary (and the heavens, not the Hollywood soundtrack). It is as close as possible to that day, and watched the event closely, from safety. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVD contains an extra hour separate from 4 sets of interviews with Ladder 1 and Engine 7.
