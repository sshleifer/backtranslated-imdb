The transgender Bobby kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) from a prominent doctor (Michael Kane) and then stalks a high-priced prostitute (Nancy Allen) who glanced at Bobby in the elevator. Liz (Allen) was suspected of committing the crime and joined the son of the patient (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in two words: it's very exciting (Dickinson) and Allen looks great), it's very bloody - with a kind of gap usually dedicated to vulgar movies, and the boy is well designed. Screenplay Writer / Director De Palma is fine, but he really takes the back seat to the man's abilities in filmmaking. He is very successful at the visceral level and I am actually involved / interested in these characters. I can see that De Palma salutes / recoils at Hitchcock - at least from one of Master's paintings. <br /> <br /> Most important of all, they have a professional and certified team. <br /> <br /> This was the third film of De Palma with former wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Films"). <br /> <br /> By the way, Rachel, who turned out to be actress Rachel Tikotin One of the production assistants. There is little trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I do not think the excitement may be upscale and bloody at the same time but this image draws it. <br /> <br /> One of the best is to record Pino Donaggio's music beautifully. <br /> <br /> 8/10
