I watched this movie on True Movies (which made me automatically skeptical) but in fact - it was good. why? Not because of the amazing plot moves or the engaging dialogue (which has little to do with it) but because of the reality, despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in portraying teenagers who deal with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> It is not Dawson Creek, they are not ingenious characters and graceful sexual life by effort. They are children and act as children do. <br /> <br /> It's sharp, confusing and annoying about everything. Yes, this can be by chance and can only be bad representatives but do not think so. Dermot Mulrone (when not trying to be great) offers very reasonable performance and I loved it. Patricia Arquette is annoying and annoying, but pregnant and teenager? A combination of two is not exactly a lavender on your pillow. The plot was very predictable but what about it? Their honesty, tension and inability to deal - their courageous, but somewhat misleading attempts to bring them closer. I think the characters, acted by anyone else, were really annoying and unbelievable but they were not. This reflects the reality of the situation in which they live, sitting in the classroom and walking on campus with the child. I felt angry about it, I felt angry at him for being a child and to blame him for it. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked it and recommended it. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the place where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
