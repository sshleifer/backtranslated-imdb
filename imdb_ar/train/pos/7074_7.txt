Terry Gilliam traveled back to the future (he had already done in Brazil) to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is completely crazy with some easy tricks on it. But it is quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he is a fantasy (the future scenes are just fantastic). For the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe are all right, but Brad Pitt is very annoying. Whenever he plays out of his will, he forces him hard and has no credibility at all. He should only play the role of a good-looking young man. My rate: 7/10
