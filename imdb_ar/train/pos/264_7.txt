Hickory dicuri duc was a good boaroo puzzle. I admit I have not read the book, although I am very impressed with Agatha Christie. Adaptation is not without its problems, there were times when humor was, and there were courageous attempts to correct it properly, it was a bit overpriced, and the events leading to the final solution were somewhat rushed. I also thought there were some slow moments, so I felt some ambiguity. However, I liked how Hickory was portrayed by Duckory Duck, and his visual style was very similar to the brilliant ABC murders, which really prepares the atmosphere, with dark camera work and dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat creepy, helped by one of Poirot's most poetic melodies, perhaps not as troublesome as those in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the basic ingredients, though not as complex as Buckle My Shoe, that's a good thing. (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in this series). In the name of Poirot, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran treat their personalities brilliantly. The students had great personalities and developed in general, especially Damien Lewis as Leonard. All in all, a solid puzzle but not ranked best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
