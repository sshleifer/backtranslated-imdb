I have read some previous comments that this film loses its strength at the end of the film and that it also has a similar end to Cape Fear I totally disagree. I will make a simple review of the ordinary filmgoers there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of the best Ed Harris shows. What a mentally unstable villain !!! I have a lot of respect to represent him after watching his performance in this film. I have been fascinated throughout this film. If you like mysterious thrillers, this is definitely a movie you want to watch. As noted by young Scarlett Johansson in this film. This movie is starry big and I highly recommend it!
