The Secret Fury, in many ways, is the romantic drama of boldness (directed by Mel Ferrer) that boasts of its pioneering principles in Colbert and Ryan; remains puzzling, if not fully grasped to the end, when unreasonableness overcomes disbelief - as happens in this type of Times. But for some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the portrayal of Lea Luffy by Vivian Vance - timeless Ethyl Mertz about "I Love Lucy". Oddly enough, Vance had very few cinematic roles. Her real home was Broadway, where (among other vehicles) she was committed to Ethyl Merman. Here they contribute to the role of a winner as a maid room underground to play a minor role in the evil scheme. Watched as she tried to avoid the smoke when an angry cigarette blew up in the hotel's linen storage room - a violation that ultimately endured the ultimate punishment.
