This Is not A Love Song. <br /> <br /> A one-word summary of this film will be "excellent." <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie will not attract an audience watching the audience ?? It's a movie <br /> <br /> forcing you to participate. I noticed and thought and asked you. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with delivery (topic / topic) and <br /> <br /> may be made with the Blair Witch Project for the overall style of photography. <br /> <br /> However, this film is unique against both. <br /> <br /> The effects of cinema (sunrise, frosty frame, blur, etc.) have been seen before but are more effectively used in this film <br /> <br /> To support the natural tension in the story . <br /> <br /> Acting is difficult, threatening, and completely believable. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film revolves around friendship. The title really gives the game away. This is probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have lived, or perhaps we really want. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
