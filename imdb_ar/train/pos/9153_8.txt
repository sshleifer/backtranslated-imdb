I finally got to see this after hearing great things about it. In fact exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved in this film was surprisingly efficient and well-made. Lack of funding has actually helped this film in several ways, especially in light of the plot. Just like the Blair Witch Project, this film was better because it was filmed instead of the film. Another bonus: While most of the low-budget horror films (even the best among the best) suffer from mediocre hysterical acting to the unwitting, this film actually had talented actors (except for one or two characters), especially two leads. The only thing missing in the film was an original story. Borrowing heavily from famous movies like "Delivery" and "Wrong Turn" but if you're like me, the movies of this kind never stop being terrifying. In addition, the director keeps things interesting all the time. I would be very interested in seeing what the manager would do with a larger budget and I felt that it would be only a matter of time before we discovered ...
