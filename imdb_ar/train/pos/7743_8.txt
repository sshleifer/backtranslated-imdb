I went to see this movie twice, and a friend of mine went to see him at the release ceremony. He told me it was so wonderful that I expected a lot about the film, and I did not expect it, I enjoyed it because I did not see it in my position. The second time I knew what I was expecting and enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt so in the mood to have a party. I loved music, it's just fantastic. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his leadership talent, he will be a way out for everyone. If you can present this movie as the first movie, you must be talented. <br /> <br /> Represented by some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofhooft) and a host of emerging talents such as Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
