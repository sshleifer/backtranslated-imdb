This was my favorite in my childhood - I can remember seeing him on television and excited him every time. Now that I have grown up and have a child of my own, I wanted to introduce it to this classic film. We saw it last Friday and loved it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept and took over - he was really scared. "Will the spider be defeated, Bupa?" Just watch, you'll see. He has no historical frame of reference to talk about (eight years old), so Baghdad may be under the grandson of Harun al-Rashid is Oz under his will. <br /> <br /> I think it was particularly impressed how many tournaments and derring-do were committed by the thief, not the adult king. In fact, if you unravel a little movie novel, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all - who must be very satisfactory to the young children adventurous with imagination. <br /> <br /> It's certainly a time period - and I think by the time I'm 11 or 12, my son will find him a "cliche" or any word used by the next generation by then. The story of love is barely one dimension - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmed love the princess? Because the novel requires it." Abu's willingness to put himself in danger (repeatedly) for the unknown and beloved deposed king is both unlikely. But to compete for such things with the acceptance of flying mechanical horses, the fifty-foot-long genes and the clear temple of the eye will all be very deadly. Satisfaction with the vision of prophecy at the height of the film is enormous, as is Abu's last shot on his magic carpet (stolen), looking for "some fun, and finally adventure!"
