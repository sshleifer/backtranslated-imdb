I was very surprised by this film. I was touched by the life Pauli had seen on his way to find Mary, the little girl he had separated from. The humor was also very good and did not hurt the story as I thought it would probably do. In fact I expected that the jokes "paulie wanted cracking" would lead to hurting this film, but even that was done in a very funny scene that turns into an effect when it paulie in a conference room laboratory press. So if you want to see the movie "talking animal" well, check out this movie, much better than Dr. Dolittle in my opinion. Polly also has a sudden twist in the end that is very well done.
