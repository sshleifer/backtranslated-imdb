The spoilers <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people." In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau showed the accuracy of this. Since Felix Ongar and Oscar Madison, Lemon and Matau respectively create good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow more slowly and more frustrated with each other, laughter becomes thick and fast, before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar a changed and cleaner person. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemon where he fights is extremely fascinating as nervous, absolute cleaning maniac handling life as a man. Walter Matthau is even as much a character as a slow sports writer who simply wants to play poker to make money for the benefits of his child. <br /> <br /> Lemon and Matau are fantastic in their chosen parts, for some, they depend on the beautiful scenario by Neil Simon, and at the same time because they work well as a team. As naturally different friends in lifestyles, although they are similar in relationships with ex-wives and children, these late and remarkable representatives create a virtually impossible partnership to reconstitute. Great indeed, that the world cried a lot for something similar, that before the death of Matao for two years and three before Lemon, the characters were reunited in a poor sequel. This idea, in the wake of Hollywood obsession with sequences, may have succeeded to a certain extent, but at the same time, it was never close to repeating the genius of this original film. <br /> <br /> In the end it is really possible to say nothing else. With Simon's stunning, humorous and laughable scenario, the creators of this film had already achieved great success. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matau, Felix Angar and Oscar Madison are an important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with traditional soundtrack ("The Simpsons"), an excellent script and a leading genius, is a tribute to cinema and a feature history must remember.
