Japan 1918. Rio's 16-year-old story begins with the death of her father. As will be revealed later, her parents died because of tuberculosis. In this desperate case, Rios's aunt arranged a marriage to a Japanese man in Hawaii, who only knew his image. Upon arriving in Hawaii, Rio discovers that her new husband is as old as the picture and that he lives in very modest conditions next to a sugar cane plantation if he works. Ryu does not get used to the hard work on the farm and the desperation of putting her in her new house is thinking of running away. You soon discover that she does not have a place to go. Friendship with Kana, a colleague in her work, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and 1920, when thousands of Asian women married men in America, who only knew their image. This image is well known and written as an actress. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro on his last screen appearance as Benshi (narrator of silent films). This film gives some ideas about Japanese culture here and across the ocean. Must see!
