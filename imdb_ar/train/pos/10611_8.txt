The so-called other references lack of personal development, I call the understatement. The film did not break a single head through excessive interpretation or unnecessary dramatic background. Yes, there were many stories that were not listed and we just got it, but it was essentially a one-day snapshot of an event that stimulated change in the lives of all the characters. Henry Thomas's performance was a truly beautiful study of the power of behavior that focused on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
