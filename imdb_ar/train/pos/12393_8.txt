For those who were interested in knowing how human beings were carefully encircled in large red horns that make me crave pomegranate, there is a duo for the shorts of the Second Renaissance. I'm not quite sure why they are split into two parts, especially since they are restricted as one section on the DVD (and are these short films shown on any format other than the DVD?), But they're rich even if they have a few gaps. <br /> <br /> What makes this first part really highlights, from the second part and the rest of the animation too, is the similarities that it shows between the robot uprising and civil rights. The diagrams of slavery, fascism, concentration camps, and mass graves are combined with verbal references to the Million Man march and God's Human Complex. In fact, "God" is never referred to by these short ribbons, but rather replaced by "the image of man". <br /> <br /> As far as the shorts in the group go, the "second renaissance: the first part" is by far the most effective in directing the emotion. It is a sad and worrisome view of the possibility of humanity becoming "an engineer to destroy it". Some may be turned off by some of the concepts torn by these short novels directly from previous science fiction literature, but again, this is what most of the Matrix series has done, and has been a driving force behind their success. <br/> <br /> - PolarisDiB
