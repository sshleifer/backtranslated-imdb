This wonderful film is mostly made up of documentaries that are currently on DVD with an introduction to war. The great American director and storyteller Frank Capra has made these films, which clearly and clearly draw attention to the main points of World War II and Hitler's rise. <br /> <br /> Every child in the school, every American, must watch these movies today because they are very aropos. History has been repeating itself over and over again! Lord Chamberlain is still alive and kicking. The tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate into countries through sympathizers and then Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working for this evil group. <br /> <br /> By sitting and leaving Hitler in the early 1935 aggressive - France, America and England caused the death of more than 50 million people. The Americans, the French and the British today have been calling Hitler fortunately to do exactly the same thing, despite the fact that we had to learn from history what happens when dictators are allowed to break treaties. <br /> <br /> These great movies may be very simple World War II amateur history. They do not simply tell the horrors of the Soviet Union because at that time the United States had cooperated with them and fought Hitler. This film tells the simple facts and motives that led to the terrible war.
