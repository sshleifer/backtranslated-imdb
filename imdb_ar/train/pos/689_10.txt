I may be playing this film because I live in New York City and suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever the case, I must commend the director on an amazing mission. Do what I did without a budget ... Wow, that's all I can say. Really really good like any money spent on this movie and still blew me away. I definitley suggest checking it out if you can. Fantastic steering, great degree and of course a script that will hit you on your ass. see her.
