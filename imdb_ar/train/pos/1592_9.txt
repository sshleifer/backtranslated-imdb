"What I like about you" is definitely a show I can not wait to see every day. Amanda Bainz is an excellent actress and I grew up watching her program: "Amanda Show". She's a very funny person and seems to be back to earth. Holly is someone with similar abilities and an "outside" personality. I enjoyed how it always seemed to turn things upside down, so I sometimes caught myself. But that's what made the show very impressive. <br /> <br /> I liked the show especially when the character "Vince" came. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as well as "Gary", Jonathan Wesley. The cast was wonderful, each character had her personality and charm. Jenny Garth, Allison Moon and Lizzie Grossman were all very exciting. I especially liked Lauren. she is the best! You helped make the presentation very enjoyable and you will never know what to do or say next! In general, the show was really great but the reason I did not give it was 10 because there were no new episodes and because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
