If you, unlike some commentators here, do not wage a class war and do not mind seeing the lives of other people who are somewhat successful, open, bohemian (moments), English was not awesome at a party and everybody got into trouble as a result, , Or closer to the European cinema than to the usual American crap ... I think the minimum design of the sound and the cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than making a bad film, I was defending this, the film is not worse as a result, and highlights the cast, Some of them are really good (Kate Hardy - I think this is her name, because the wine is sarcastic e One exception is David Baddiel, who should not be allowed to appear in dangerous things !! It's light, we do not go to this kind of crap dissecting the relationship in this country, but if you do not have any real friends to go to a party with what you could do worse than sit down and watch these.
