It is an amazing film, both for the incredible energy inspired by frenetic flamenco dance, and the unique way in which filmmakers confuse the story of theater production with the lives of the characters it prepares for. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not "Karnit Bizet" by any standard. This is not a standard film by any standard. Every subtle look, every trick of the foot, and every piece of music is entwined so that you can not close your eyes from the screen. You do not need opera or flamenco (I do not) to be caught, angry, and charmed by this film. Hidden and direct. Loud and still one of the films, if not the best, kind of beautiful, because there are a few similar films.
