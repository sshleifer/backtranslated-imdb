"The Godfather" of television, but apart from the acclaimed characters and Hashish, the two are not alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in one family he is the beloved father but not the ideal husband, and in the other family he is ruthless. After the analysis, Dr. Millie concludes that Tony's problems are already derived from his mother, Livia, who is suspected of having borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini rightly praised the main character; however, Bracco and Marschand were almost not recognized for their equally gifted performances with the psychiatrist and the mother, respectively. Falko, Empirioli and Dimatio have won their outstanding supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is completely convincing. Chianz, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in the film The Godfather, plays Tony and his uncle and stops him. Many fans also enjoyed pastures of Pasteur, Ventimilia, Coratola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lib, Siura and Posemi. Tony's children are "fine" but they are not noticeable (except for the stunning performance of Elier in Episode 3 to the latter, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are not convinced but are very elaborate, but the show is very strong for them. Even with the continued supply of more than six seasons, it stops to have a dull or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
