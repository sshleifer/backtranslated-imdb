I love this show. I see all redirects every day even though I've seen them all like 6 times each. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Baines) and Val (Jenny Garth), who lives in New York. Holly goes to live with Fall when their father is moved to Japan. Val enjoys the ideal life and has a perfect friend and apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems that Vall and Holly face. The main problem is men but also about responsibility and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and she is completely free spirit while Fall is just the opposite. It is the organization that must have a plan to do something of some kind. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.
