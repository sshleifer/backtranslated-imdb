This movie is awesome! I touched my cold stone heart. I could not talk about the racial discrimination Anthony suffered because I live in my country. I think it's really hard to distinguish. <br /> <br /> We saw this film in the sociology class at the University of New Ira, and I did not know it was a real story, I think it was just created by intellectuals who want to bring fresh air into the industry. It was very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me when Nadine assaulted Antoine (who was 6 years old) was sexually assaulted. If I were on his shoes, she would have jumped into a tall ten-story building. I salute him because he was very strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Anton finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not get upset or anything else, but told her about the achievements he had made during the long years that separated. (I think I'll do it when I get a chance to track my roots.)
