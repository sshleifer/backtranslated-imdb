If you're a fan of Crispin Glover, you should see it. If you're a fan of Sean Penn, you should see that. If you're a fan of movies in general, you should see it. If you do not have a clue about Crispin Glover and you do not have a clue about Shane Shawn's identity, it may still have a lot of value, but the more works you've seen before with Crispin or Shawn, the better. <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny, but it is also a pure genius. There is nothing I know like this movie. It's his type. I doubt that anything like that will be made again. I can not say anything more about the exact cause without partially spoiling it, and some other reviews here have done a good job of doing so. <br /> <br /> In response to any reviewers here who gave her a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, there is no point at which this movie can be called "boring." Perhaps this is the most entertaining, funniest and least boring movie ever. It only improves with age and repeated observations. The timeless classic that, unfortunately, few of them will be able to claim to have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work by director Trent Harris, who is also responsible for the amazing Robin and Ed, whose Crispin Glover is also the star in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this movie are rare and hard to find. I managed to find the VHS version after some diligent search, there are two ways to find it. But I really hope someone puts this on a DVD.
