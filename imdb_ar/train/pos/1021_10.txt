The first and second seasons began to shake, with good loops falling between those mediums, and sometimes resorting to the stories of Klesheed. But as soon as I began to form the universe in which he began to develop his characters more, he became more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the success of this show is the result of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Delois, Joseph Malozi and Paul Molly. Richard's comic spirit makes him appear much better, and Peter's output is excellent and makes any episode much more entertaining. Joe and Paul never fail to make a funny and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what is going on around the show and identify the characters, I doubt you will like the show. For those who enter the exhibition, I suggest episodes of "The Other Side", a dangerous and good episode, and "The Chance Window", a classic comic relief episode.
