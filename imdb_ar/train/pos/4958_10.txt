Full disclosure: I am sarcastic. I love my sad end and my dry hankies. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was hit. The new movie "Happiness" by Will Smith appears to be a desperate appeal for the Oscar. I was born without an artistic spirit. <br /> <br /> So why on Earth did you like "10 elements or less?" Maybe it was a double espresso I dropped before the show. Or (most likely) perhaps even the most popular film lovers have difficulty using casual sweetness. <br /> <br /> It's sweet. From the moment he meets "Scarlet" (a distant event from "Nora Ephron" meets nice), the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to pay attention to their places of life. (Beautifully supported by a camera like Phedon Papamichael.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the film is that it is out of reach. Is the movie elusive? I do not know, I do not know. you tell me. I have yet to meet Adrian Prodi in the market. (However, not because of no attempt). Do I enjoy looking at the adventures that might happen in the event of this important event? Straight Drum I do. . This is where most "10 or fewer" ratings fall short. . They fail to take into account that we are so cynical as our fantasies. Sometimes, it is worth being accepted to live together, 82 minutes at a time.
