I love this movie Chris Shurman did a great job! Not only is the actor incredible, but he is awesome with awesome fitness! He did a great job of connecting his lines, as well as turning him into George better than Fraser did. Great performance for his first major roll! This film is full of fun scenes that every child will love. My kids watched this movie several times since we bought the DVD the day it was released. In addition to the movie, the additions to the DVD are funny. Two thumbs on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
