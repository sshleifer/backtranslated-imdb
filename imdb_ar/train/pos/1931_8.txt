Community Pool in Connecticut is the setting for this film "Under the Radar" which is enchanting, funny, amusing, and attractive. Although she won awards at major film festivals, The Big Bad Swim did not go to the hordes of theaters all over America, but was distributed in DVD format and was selected in theaters selectively. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "The Big Bad Swim" never had the marketing hype for Hollywood, considering the number of submarines released by Hollywood this year, such as "I Know Who Killed Me." "The Big Bad Swim," a really good independent film, had to swim upstream alone. <br /> <br /> However, in the movie "The Big Bad Swim," Paget Brewster is as affectionate and reliable as Amy, the wired math teacher to the point of collapse that is not only left by her husband but is about to lose her job , And end up playing a new gamble. Television soap opera actor Jeff Branson, a HOT, plays Noah, a serious and weak swimming teacher who goes the extra length of the pond to help his students overcome their fears and discover he can learn from his students. Beautiful and exciting Jess Wickler (Have you just seen a commercial in a bank?) Brilliantly playing Jordan, a man who works in two jobs, one as a pole dancer, and the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character provides a catalyst for change between the group, but the least understandable, because of the lack of a "background story" or the motivation to do what she does. Jordan is small enough to live at home with his younger brother everywhere who portrays the video camera and spies on it. However, her parents do not appear in her life in any way, which seems strange. There is no drunk mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal, attractive young woman from a suburb of Connecticut has chosen to be a self-conscious dancer who hides herself for the dazzling bachelor parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this dodge, "The Big Bad Swim" succeeds, in large part, because it is a happy movie, and feels good. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, learning to swim is a metaphor for life. In the end, it is best to jump with both feet, swimming, rather than sitting on the deck, because life is happening to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is a great movie of history, it's a wonderful film, Amber, the movie "What I Did not See" is awesome, and men love it as well as women.
