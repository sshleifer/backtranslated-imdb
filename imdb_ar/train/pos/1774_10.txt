After setting the world of the sitcom with the creation of "Father Ted" Arthur Matthews and Graham Linhan next, was a forgotten gem for the BBC called "hippies" Although the couple were created by the couple, the six texts written by Arthur Matthews alone. <br /> <br /> Located in London in 1969 - Ray Perps, a hippie, is the editor of Anarchist Magazine. His friends are his flat companion, the house that smoked cannabis and smoked Alex, and his girlfriend is the generation of feminism and not Hugo the Orient. <br /> <br /> Simone Beige was as wonderful as Ray, but he's gorgeous in everything he is in. This sitcom felt "Citizen Smith" about it. Ray was very much like Wolf Smith, trying to overcome society, but failed miserably. Finally, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, and I can not wait to buy it. As in 1999 and never repeated on terrestrial television - my memories are not very good in the sitcom, but I remember two episodes clearly. The first was the opening of the "Hippie Protest" which I thought was a great start - Ray was protesting on the paper and the other episode was " Hippy Dippy Hippies "which I think was episode 4, and once again was a very clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (I can not think why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies Episode 4 - Series 1.
