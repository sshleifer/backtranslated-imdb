The third aspect, in my opinion, is the best in the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the most amusing figure in the previous series, but Prince Regent of Hugh Laurie conveniently laughs at the line. <br /> <br /> As a package through quality and through convincing Regency collections, wonderful irony and small pieces of asshole, representatives of "Macbeth" stand with Prince George's impression of our luck in chickens, and the lost words of Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Some comedy movies were just as smart as they are funny, well, the observation or the strange lame line encounters them but often it's a cry.
