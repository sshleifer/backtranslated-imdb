I have no problem with the film, which I thought was very good. This is the actual video of the LAPD crime that bothered me. I wonder if the Lion Gate really believes that the audience wants to see people who have been brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. Sorry, Lion Gate, was an incredibly bad idea !!! <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer like the late John Holmes. John Holmes was corrupt, mistreated by women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, and Kate Bosworth as his friend), and deep in hopelessness. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogusian) creates a spiral that resulted in the wondrous murders in Wonderland. Exactly how much Holmes was involved in the murders? We may never know the full truth of the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the film does a very good job though.
