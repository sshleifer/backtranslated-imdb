Butterfly wings in the Atlantic can flutter with a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean. According to this theory (which is somehow associated with chaos theory, I'm not sure exactly), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will begin a series of reactions that can lead to major events. This little gem of the film shows us a series of unrelated characters, mostly in Paris, whose work will affect each other's lives. (The theory of six degrees of separation can also be applied). Each story is an aspect of the jewel that represents this film. The representation is carefully tuned and accurate (Audrey Tutu flare), the stories are intertwined reasonably, the humor is fine, and the viewer leaves the stage nod in agreement.
