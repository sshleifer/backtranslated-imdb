Actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It is good that Robin Williams got the role of the comic Oscurric, otherwise it may be a bit odd to see him in such production. It's really nice to have Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text, and that certainly does not happen much ... Thanks to the viewers being able to see the whole parts, not the parts chosen by the director. Also - thank God that the film in the form of a classic; Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, Hamlet's story is different, at least this from my point of view.
