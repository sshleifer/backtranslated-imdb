I enjoyed watching the red eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and organized. Celian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are ideal in this role. Yes, it is the same old story with a different environment, but Wes Craven gave it a good speed. At least not another scream with the usual college killer. It is great to see a clean, coherent thrill even when authenticity does not stand out as its main character. Especially from a film director such as Craven, who brought a lot of innovative ideas to the kind of excitement and horror of the past that now gives way to bring what might be a good television movie if it is not staged. good job!
