Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I must say # 1 is Christine McIntyre. Samb scene when poisoned and reacted really wonderful. I imagine that, as one of the posters suggested, Christine was trying to curb laughter during this scene, but in fact made her look more evil, to smile at the death of Chimp. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps this stand out is Goon. His view was a great intersection between the hideous ball and comedy. I hardly choose a character I meet in a dark alley or, anywhere else. You're a little better than this real puzzle in this, but hey, when this thing is good, it's going to complain. not me
