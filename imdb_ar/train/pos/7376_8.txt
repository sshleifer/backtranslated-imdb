I really enjoyed this first appearance by the ring director, Hideo Nakata. If you've already seen the Ring, you'll be familiar with the style and idea of ​​that click. She has a hidden fear about the subject that works better than the sting (which is predictable) that pervades most of the mainstream genre films. If you like movies that give you chills, you might like these movies. Good, creepy debut by Hideo Nakata. 10/08
