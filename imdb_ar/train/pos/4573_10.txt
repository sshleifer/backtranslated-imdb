Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he threw himself into each of the characters he plays to make it real. <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a party at our house - the friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having fun. The TV was on - there was a movie we did not notice very much. Then suddenly we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not intertwine, the thorns did not move, the food was getting cooler on the dishes. We could not keep our eyes off the screen where the paralyzed young man, who had his whole body against him and who was controlling only his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and tried forever to write only one word on the ground. When we finished writing that word, we all knew that we had not seen one victory but three victories - the triumph of human will and spirit, the triumph of cinema that captured this moment in the film, the triumph of a representative who did not act but became his character. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's "left foot" is a non-emotional, cultured biological drama about Christie Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in the slums of Dublin; who became an artist and writer and found a love for his life. <br /> <br /> I love every day of the Day Lewis shows (I have mixed feelings about his performance at GONY) but I think his biggest role was Christie Brown in "My Left Foot"
