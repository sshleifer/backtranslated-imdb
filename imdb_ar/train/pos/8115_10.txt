The first two parts seek to reduce the futility of wasted wars and governance by the national barbarians. The third part expects that progress and exploration towards the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring the effective use of talent and human resources. His speeches are rejected by some viewers as naive or explosive, but that makes others fail to thrill. It depicts a rifle / space launcher and a helicopter, as well as innovative mass communication equipment, lifts, flat panel displays and wireless intercom. This may not be true about future windowless buildings. But he portrays a child-like vision of a scientific / technical inquiry that has no limits. <br /> <br /> It seems to me like a film about a group of rational rational thinkers guided by a Spinoza-like ethic in their quest for immortality themselves and living ethically through scientific progress and a unified global government. Proponents of progress (such as the Kabbalah) believe that humanity can "live forever" by preserving our experiences and progress for future generations, and always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur S Clark (author 2001: A Space Odyssey) This film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF film. Kubrick hated this and said he would not watch another film based on Clark's suggestions (Source: Clark's own millennium introduction to his 2001 novel). Although the late Clark continued to propose at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best SF films. It is beautifully designed by Menzies, but has very modest special effects (especially game tanks). <br /> <br /> Personally I loved him and I think he captures the spirit of the times. It is a bit naive about how reasonable a society can be without crime for a long time. It also seems unreasonable about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me that we can easily return to the dark ages or at least be so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves through overcrowding or our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. But it portrays the importance of risking public and educator anger because of potential threats to space and death. It is difficult for us to choose the side of progress on simple desires for safety, comfort or happiness: CABAL: "Very long {rest} And very early, we call it death. To continue - the conquest beyond the conquest - this little planet and its winds and ways, and all the laws of the mind and things that restrict him, and then the planets, and finally through the magnitude of the stars and when invaded all the depths of space and all the mysteries of time - will still begin. <br /> <br /> CABAL: "If we are no more than animals - we must get rid of our little scraps of happiness, living, suffering and traffic, no matter more than all other animals - or it's over." {It refers to the stars.} "This is - or this? All the universe - or nothingness ..." (excerpts from a script). <br /> <br /> If this sounds like a rationalization of the whole society to advance, the members of the Council (from the world government) will look like technocrats. In fact, these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other sentiments freely, and they will have to be suppressed by government bans, anti-science and experiment laws, and other states and restrictive uses of power that will turn their critics into tyrants. <br /> <br /> In fact, a large group of insurgents in the plot are scornful of all Council developments in science and technology, so they are trying to put an end to progress and put an end to the Council's freedom of experience. The Progressive Progress Council will not suppress freedom of expression for the rebels, although it is only a "gas of peace" in times of emergency and wants only freedom and space to pursue its progress. <br /> <br /> So it is also a story about freedom of science, as much as it is about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society actually agree with some of these basic elements, with the exception of social prejudices (many want to ban cloning, for example) or natural nature (some of us do not want to move freely, and prefer to become extinct in time during Enslavement to earth) or fear / reason (some believe that we are not ready for science / advanced technology because we may destroy ourselves). But Kabal, the president of the council, has an answer to the problem of danger: "Our (scientific) revolution has not eliminated death or danger.
