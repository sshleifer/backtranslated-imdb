Ernst Lubitch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is a wonderful collection of films that will live forever, as with "The Shop Around the Corner". This film has been re-produced in other films less distinctive and musical, without the charm or elegance of his own copy of Mr. Lubitch. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart have worked in many movies together. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a film without appearing almost as acting at all. Both stars are fun because pen friends do not know each other, but who would have made them work together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason behind the success of these classic films is well supported is the stunning cast studios put together in a post-image image. Here, we have a wonderful Frank Morgan, who plays the role of store owner. Also, we see Joseph Childcrawt, Felix Presart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing a wonderful job in making us think that yes, they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these films will live forever!
