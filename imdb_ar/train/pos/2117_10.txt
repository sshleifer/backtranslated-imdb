Every time I watch this film, I'm more impressed with the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. All concerned is perfect. Script, representation, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always rely on good performance, and the supporting actors are superb, Margaret Solvan is the one who reveals the actress she was arrogant. Her tragic personal life greatly influences her qualities as a performer where comedy skills can not easily be achieved. Lopez managed to get the best and obviously did his best. Watch the number of scenes taken in one breathtaking shot.
