I will go out on one side and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good episode of the videos, about the life and death struggle of William Thomas Reeker, who was fighting a deadly disease. > <br /> The scenes from the flashback sequence were well executed with the mood of Reeker as he was when he retrieved his romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments such as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil" were highlighted, as well as the risk factors that shake the pulse in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and "Skin of Evil" above. Riker also showed courage under the fire by telling him some joking jokes, such as "the snake was bitten by a snake once ... After 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode highlighted the psychological plight of Lowell Reker under severe coercion. And yes, in my opinion, I am troubled by the announcement of a "gray shadow" as a solid link, because at the time of its original broadcast my face was covered with sweat. I wonder if Riker will withdraw alive and live to see other great galaxies in outer space beyond the limits. .. <br /> <br /> Of course, in later years, I seem to have formed a unique opinion in this particular episode ... But, if you should award the "Best Clip Show in TV History", then I think this The seminar should be highly appreciated in this regard.
