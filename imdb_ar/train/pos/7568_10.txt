I saw this last day of my festival, and I was glad to have commented on that extra day. Poetic, moving, and most surprising, funny, in his own peculiar way. It is very rare to see managers working in this way and can find the real sense of humor in a world of realism, without being precious or unbalanced. Enables the emergence of both impromptu, but fully controlled. (Casavets, Malik, Loch, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsey David Gordon Green), you are in a real treat. . It's a great movie, and I hope more people can see it. If this movie plays in a festival in your city, go! Go! Go!
