This was excellent. Touch, packed, ideal for Kurt Russell. I loved this movie, it is worth more than 5.3 stars or so. This film is the story of an old soldier learns that there is more in the life of the soldier, people who know that there is time to fight, need to defend. I cried, laughed and sat mostly in awe of this story. Good writing function for working flick, plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The end was not crooked, but it was still excellent. If you want to escape from New York, or root out the underdog, this movie suits you. Not an unnecessary amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to monitor in this regard. Something for everyone.
