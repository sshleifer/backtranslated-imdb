This ranked best in Zorro. The exciting musical score adds an exciting game to you. There is a wonderful and mysterious evil support that will keep you guessing until the last chapter. Red Hadley does a good job like Don Diego and his alternative style Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the big steering group for Whitney and English.
