This fairly modest series deserves the credit of television history books for two reasons: it was the first to win the Emmy Award for Best Series, the first to come from the famous Republic Pictures studios, known as the low-budget, high-powered shootings of the 1930s Of the last century. <br /> <br /> Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to jump into the small screen, which was still in its infancy. But the studio period as a product for the core of the television will be short. After this show, they later coordinated with the other format they were famous for, the Adventure Series, with "Commando Cody", as well as other series, but like this, they did not complete more than 39 episodes. Also, the republic was in its final stages as a studio. Her tenure in Hollywood will end as the lease for many Revue Studio series like "Soldiers of Fortune", "The Original Dragnet" and "Kit Carson", before finally closing in 1959. <br /> <br /> Anyway , "The Stories of the Century" was not too bad for someone else. Her calling card was tales based on authentic Western history figures, especially outlaws like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin and Dalton Bruce. Jim Davis, known for his role as Ewing's patriarch in Dallas, did a great job in leading roles like Matt Clarke, a fictional railway detective dealing with those outlaws, played by the veteran and soon by potential personal actors. <br /> <br /> There are two great facts here: the incidents will occur at different time periods, some in the 1880s, some at the end of the century, but Clark never progressed. Also, Matt enjoys the joy of having a great time wandering around with two beautiful checkers, such as Frankie Adams, who played the role of Mary Castle, and replaced, Margaret "Jones" Jones, to Christine Miller. The only guard could only wish a lady companion. You can spend just such a time with Tonto for a long time. <br /> <br /> "Stories Of The Century" is the production of Studio City TV from Republic Pictures Corp. 39 episodes were produced during 1954, all 39 in the public domain and on DVD.
