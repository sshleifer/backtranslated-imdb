Good luck finding this movie to watch it - not yet released on tape or DVD. I saw in the early 1970s that I was lucky enough to be caught up in the efforts to preserve the American Cinematheque and still have some concrete moments that have stayed with me for 30 years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat rwint's accurate comments here. As a novice manager shortly after the success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N was said to have managed the low-budget effort as best he could, and it certainly appears in the roaming and zigzag that could have been used for some re-pieces. But it is also an unforgettable icon in time: the sharp confrontations of university sports in the late 1960s, student movements, sexual revolution and much more. <br /> <br /> Why do you see this movie? It is likely to be a starting point in some scenes: the masculine bonding in bathing after the game. Karen Black's scene with the Tipper in the car will catch your attention a bit - but it's the first use of a word I've never seen before in the film; the casual and unexpected use of nudity in general. Perhaps others have overlooked them. <br /> <br /> Look for a nice surprise for Cindy Williams in one of her first films; David Eugene Stirrs; Mike Warren's new uniform in powder-colored UCLA and preparing for dark blue television; Robert Town - actor; and many people playing themselves Simply. <br /> <br /> Now: Any link between Harry Gittis and the last name and Robert Town and a certain character in Chinatown and Jakes? <br /> <br /> You get a "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
