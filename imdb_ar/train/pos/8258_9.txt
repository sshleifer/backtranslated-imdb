At risk of sounding to some extent, in the premiere, I tend to put this thing on par with "dead Shaun." Now, seeing Simon Beige as an indisputable comic genius, I realize that this is a fairly big claim. And to what extent you agree with this last statement, may be a good first measure of whether Fido will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> In a way that captures the comedy where Sean stopped, except that we came back in the 1950s in a small Central American town living in the Age of the Dead. Zombie wars have ended and zombies themselves have become more useful members of society. This, so we learned at first, thanks in large measure to the scientific progress made by good people in Zomcom - perhaps a beautiful play on romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its portrayal of the dead to a respectable area that preserves core values ​​while providing a place for zombies and the special dangers they pose. The magic and balance that this is doing is near perfect enough. The themes you might expect are from a more distinctive comedy in quiet music - the crust of good clean life, keeping up with appearances, pent-up passion, chaotic parental values, social decoration, and the odd plight of the individual. <br /> <br /> A story that tells of happy hearts and a wide-ranging attraction through the powerful, powerful film. It is one of those acts that show the fact that all participants participated in a penalty of participation. It's also interesting to imagine what Billy Connelly should have been learning ... <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, you probably will appreciate the humor of this movie unless your father tries to eat you.
