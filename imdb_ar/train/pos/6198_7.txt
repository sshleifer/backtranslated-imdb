I'm one of those people who crawled a mile through the broken glass to watch Hal Hartley. From TRUST, IRIS to HENRY FOOL and NO SUING THING, the unique Hal brand of movies is an acquired taste. Instilling equal parts of mystery / espionage with a mysterious comedy seems to be his home. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often takes place across a whole scene before it pays off. This is the case with FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Bean. <br /> <br /> Parker Bossi plays the role of Faye Grimm, the abandoned wife of Henry Fall and the mother of Henry's only son. Fei lives a quiet life until she returns home one day to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, a public man) and wants Henry's notebooks. There are many Henry Bean notebooks, and it was thought by all that they contain nothing but crazy roaming. There seems to be a lot to them. Secrets of weapons research or methods for terrorists? Who knows but Henry. Client Fulbright Fei told her husband that she had died, but was soon considered a ploy to get Fei out of her house and look for Henry (he works ... but not the way they think). <br /> <br /> Fei fights several spy rings to collect Henry's books and search for him. She also has a deal with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of jail (helped Henry escape the country in the original Henry Bean film.) Several intertwined events occur in rapid succession: spy rings shoot each other to death, Henry's presence in "safety" by a jihadist, Fay releases her brother but risks the life of her son Tidria, and the CIA is exposed to its position of putting Fei at risk. <br /> <br /> Hart Hartley obviously likes to play with the themes. He does it to the extreme here. Even the names of the characters (Grimm, Fool, Fulbright, Vogue) have their own implicit meanings and are very funny. The spy films that surround Ol's film give plenty of screen time, too, as the guns go off in motionless sequences, never hitting our heroines even though they are in the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Now that I have been praised for this creation, I will say that the excessive portrayal of Parker Posey is not the best part of the film, which is a shame given how much time you spend on the screen. I realize that this may have been what Mr. Hartley wanted: a troubled woman with hand signals to the extreme of Italy. But it was still certain to be seen at times. <br /> <br /> However, fans are likely to devour Fei Grimm and beg for more. Although this was not Hal Hartley's favorite film, I know I'm ready.
