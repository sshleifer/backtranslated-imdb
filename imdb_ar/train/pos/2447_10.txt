George Lopez has never caught my attention in his comedic stance and is still not interested. But this exhibition is a work of art. Never show where you keep jokes every time you remember them (and jokes you do not forget about it). This show contains only an optimistic look and the characters range from short and short drunken to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who is writing this show but this person is doing a great job. If they continue to show, I'm sure he will get a positive response from critics of this great country. If you're looking for a good traditional comedy, George Lopez is the right show for you! The bad thing is the title. George Lopez? really? Imagine that the new Prince of Bel Air is "Will Smith". come on man! But otherwise, this show is a genius! 10/10
