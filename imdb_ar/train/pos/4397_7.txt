An unconventional historical drama, with some beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire offers excellent performance and a good backup. The program is up to a fairly innovative, and the movie is saved without the mercy of heroes. However, it pulls a bit, and resembles the last pulley a very small television series. However, the photographer Frederick Elmes retains the interest in dim bits (and every time you see a snapshot that reminds you that he worked with David Lynch). worth watching.
