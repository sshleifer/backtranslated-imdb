This movie caught on T.V last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a good actor in the film, and it's wonderful to see him in something other than the 1970s. The movie was not rated but in my opinion I would rate (r) just because of nudity and lots of adult content. But everyone in everything I liked, I think the dirt fillings were very funny. It's basically just about a man who has no job, girlfriend or money, and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more than a messenger really). It's framed to kill a rock star and rock rock stars who really need people to help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
