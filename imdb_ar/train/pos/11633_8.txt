Red Eye is not the kind of film that will win the Palme D'or, but Wes Craven was not the kind of director, however, and his brand is a good indication of what filmgoers can expect. <br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a few tight and languid bundle in 94 minutes is part of its charm and a sign on Craven's craft in producing light but fun overall box office fare. In fact, it is the ideal kind of film that is displayed as a 24-hour entertainment activity and attracts attention without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a sense of cowardice in the plot and the mysterious terrorist sub-plot. Motivation and supporting characters, the main section has a sense of television film. However, there are specific elements to the thrill of Hitchcockian, echoes of Schumacher Booth's phone, which is ultimately the most sophisticated play (and patriotism) on the same idea of ​​emotional crisis that is canceled in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses primarily on two people sitting in airline seats, it lives or dies on characters and text. The main reasons for Cillian's glacial but eloquent film are Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams. Not only does the dialogue take place, it also gives Adam a kind of leg dimension to fight "masculine logic" against female sensibility. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the film, Craven indulges in a little man-like scream The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after being treated "just for men" and appearing everywhere in various movies like Super Troopers and The Ring, which made him the sexual version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short-term fun.
