Drama / Sweet Romantic Comedy Stuart and Solvan write love letters to each other without knowing each other. Of course, they work together and can not stand with each other. You can guess what's left. She is beautifully represented by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), and has clever, intelligent text and looks to the stunt. This is done in Budapest and has been shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing that I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks very perfect and resembles a dream. A movie of its kind. do not miss!
