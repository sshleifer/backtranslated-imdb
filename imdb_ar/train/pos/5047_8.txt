Actor Paxton made his first appearance in the film with this impressive dark film of the making of a widower mechanic (Paxton himself), tying his cubs to participate in the brutal murder of the ax, claiming that the victims were not human at all but "devils" Their choice by God to destroy these "devils". All of this is told by one of the children, now raised (Matthew McConaughey) to the FBI agent The Poke. <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically; better than most serial killer features, it's a crooked and troubling tale that is directly narrated with minimal cinematic tricks. It is commendable that Paxton hardly shows any blood to the end. Good behavior by everyone, especially child actors (Jeremy Sompeter from Peter Pan, Matt O'Leary from Spy Kids 2 and Home Disorder). The only reason to deduct any points at all is that I can understand that some people may have difficulty getting all this. In any case, it's an unusual film with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
