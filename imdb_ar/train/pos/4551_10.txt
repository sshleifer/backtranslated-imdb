I have never seen such an incredible work in a moving picture as I saw when I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing Christie Brown in my left foot. In fact, his role was not over. He played the role of Christie Brown or at least a handicapped like him all through filming and needed surgery due to damage to his superior performance on his back. To me this is wonderful, and through all the pain that it carries to play this role, I think it is entirely correct to say that it placed on Oscar the most worthy performance in history. He was so brilliant in this hard part that I think no one can do it better or have a bigger impact than him. Although I can not say that it is the greatest film of all time, I can say that how he played this role is impossible and then he continued to represent it until he was not acting yet. It is undoubtedly the greatest foot I have ever seen. Maybe a man too for this matter.
