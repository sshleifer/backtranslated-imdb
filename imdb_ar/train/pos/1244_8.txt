I saw this film for the first time on television a few years ago and I loved it frankly. Charles Dance is one of the most horrible bad guys that anyone can imagine. His development is such an ideal contradiction of a rude good hero. I have never been a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I find his disturbing image here a winner: "Axel Foley through the look." Charlotte Lewis uses a fictitious term but the only applicable and exhilarating phrase. Some wonderful scenes are created: dream sequences, birds, silly fighting scenes, and climatic confrontation. Through all of this, the contemporary man was suddenly dropped into an Eastern legend, a staggering and quieter version of Kurt Russell in an Eastern fantasy story. Like this movie, we have James Hong, an unrivaled actor who lifts his sights, no matter how short, Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong actor actor actor, "class action" of his career. The Golden Child is ridiculous. It's not perfect. But it has many features of recovery so that the imagination is fun and enjoyable, worth watching. After four years I saw the Golden Child again; I enjoyed it more! It's really great fun.
