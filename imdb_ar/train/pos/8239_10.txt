In the immortal "Shaun of the Dead," we met London, where both dodgers and powerful are forced to fight physical eating and free bodies of their friends and family. At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombie becomes harmless and used as cheap labor. "Fido" presents us with the conclusion of "Shawn" in America in the 1950s, in "What If ...?" the movie. <br /> <br /> After the horror of the zombie war, the film was set up in the post-zombie era for the change. It ended with the creation of ZomCon and patented zombie collars that make bodies as docile as lambs. Every town in the world is surrounded by walls of the wild area, once fertile land torn apart by the surviving zombies and exaggerated wars of horrors. The idyllic town of Willard is the typical suburban suburb of the 1950s, with one small difference; the social status is measured by the amount of family of domesticated zombies. Unfortunately, the Robinson family has no zombie at all, because of their patriarch, Bill, their fear of death. Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen suffer from the pressures of suburban life, until the day Helen buys a zombie maid in a desperate attempt to convince neighbors. <br /> <br /> The zombie earns Timmy's love when he saves him. From a pair of violent bullies, and the two form a link to rival the classic "boy and dog" cliches ... boy and zombie. Timmy names his "pet" Fido and soon becomes an assistant to Timmy and Helen to escape Bill's prison-like routine. But when Fido's smoking collar surrounds Fritz and is tormented by the old lady Henderson, Robinson has to keep in touch with the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still be able to keep the beloved Fido. <br /> <br /> A film that carries its sharp intelligence and satire as much as all stars (including "Carrie Anne Moss's Matrix" as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly Fido), "Fido" is a zoom-in for ages. The somewhat twisted sub-workshops - for example, the pleasant and disturbing feelings that Helen and Vido begin to each other - and an influential commentary on the suburbs of the 1950s and the zombie genre, the film manages to get the worst (and better) characters out of your mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fido is by far one of the best dark comedy movies I have ever seen, one of the best Long time, the best zoom com since "Shaun of the Dead" is incredible.
