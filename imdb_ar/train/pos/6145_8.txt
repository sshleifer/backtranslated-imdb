Mary Bubbins is certainly much better, but this is a nice film though. Angela Lansbury is as wonderful as Angeline Price, and David Tomlinson enjoys great fun like Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was also wonderful. Children, despite their lack of brilliance itself, although Paul is very funny and cute. In fact the songs were not as bad as some say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, indeed all the songs are great. The special effects were wonderful, had a lot of charm, and the story was original enough. Prominent points, such as Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was nice, but my favorite was the football match, which was quite joyful. The only other criticism was that I did not get to the end when I first saw her. All in all, a beautiful movie, hardly ever. Bethany Cox
