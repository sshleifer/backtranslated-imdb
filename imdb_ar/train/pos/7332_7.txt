I had seen scraps of this as a child, but while I bought the Blue Underground kit immediately because it was a limited edition, I only installed it in my watch schedule - mainly due to the recent appearance of Bakshi American POP (1981) on Italian television late From night (see my review of this movie below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found that the movie is a very good epic with the sword and the animated magician with particularly impressive backgrounds (the somewhat amazing characters were puzzling, recognized, less) with a derivative thriller scored a goal. The plot, once again, was not entirely original, but it proved to be an unmistakable event-level event and the protagonists were well developed enough - particularly interesting, the wicked Snowman Necron and Darkwolf's mysterious warrior; however, the heroine and heroine are stereotypical images Nice - but one can not complain when depicting Bakshi and Frazetta the girl with good talent (she can tear her bra in any second) and half naked to take off (her small panties forever) disappear her ass!) However, it is clearly an action-oriented piece that is definitely progressing on this front (involving Darkwolf being particularly brutal); the final confrontation despite being short, is well handled and sees that our heroes are watching the fake winged crawler attacking the cache The villains inside the cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, apart from the above-mentioned Frazetta backgrounds, the main appeal of this film to me now is the nostalgia factor because it brought me back to my childhood. I did not just watch films like Conan the Barbarian (1982) BEASTMASTER (1982) but also a mobile television series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82), businessman and professors of the universe (1983-1985). <br /> <br /> As for the accompaniment of the fire and ice industry (television) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> An antiquated feature of the sword and sorcery animation film which is not available Except through the washed VHS version owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It covers some details about the rotoscope technology, and shows several instances of live "presentations" (in a studio) of segments of the script - which can then be traced, mixed with backgrounds and photographed. However, having seen many of these features from behind the scenes on the art of animation (on the Disney sets of Warcraft and Looney Tunes, for example), it does not make a very convincing piece ...
