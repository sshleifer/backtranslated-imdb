A summary of the future as seen from 1939 England. As war looms over Europe, salvation will not be found for humanity in past policies. It is up to the brave new science scientist to overcome the mistakes of the past man. <br /> <br /> The concept regarding the scene is to warn your leaders and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS I have seen this movie for a long time and have recently downloaded it from the Internet (it's available to the public) domain.) This is a great job on several levels. As a story about the future as seen from 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is terrifying and strange. This film was developed for today. The special effects are very good as is the story line. Acting has little to do with the British play, because it can be a little bit inclined to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. Other films are that charismatic leaders are the curse of human existence, and may always be with us. <br /> <br /> The foundations of all subsequent science fiction films can be seen in this film. The "Forbidden Planet" design and reinforced cabinet, the 2001 "A Space Odessy" technology flaw, and even Star Wars's landscape / city views owe some inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film makes the viewer a bit puzzled. While he is optimistic in his final sequence to reach the stars, we have left to wonder whether the human race will be able to do so. Even when we arrive, there are those who are trying to curb us. These films see for the future while interesting is also a little humorous by today's standards. The massive aircraft and weapons that can shoot people in space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were the next logical step. <br /> <br /> There are many great British actors in this film as a young man. Cedric Hardwick and Ralph Richardson are the two most famous and articulate skills here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play a leading character, Capel. His character almost appears when he sent the new Christ to save the world from his destruction with the religion of the new science. <br /> <br /> This is a good cinematic history whose themes are still relevant today, even if the vision of the future is absent from the mark.
