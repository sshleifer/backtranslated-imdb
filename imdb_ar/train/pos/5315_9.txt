This film was very strange and very funny. All actors are very real and very strange. The overall "appearance" of the film was also different, it was a kind of dream and bleach, which added only to the wide, amazing and strange appearance of everything. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, not what you call "mainstream" but that's what I liked. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. . . Unpredictable, with strange rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places. Children are very sad idiots (and husks) so you can not help but feel them. In other words, these versions are far from Hollywood versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> All of them, which for me, make them a good thing.
