This series was cut off from the rest of the television detective series today but somehow did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​blind detective may not be entirely new, but it is often added to a story. And who can forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series! <br /> <br /> While the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series and settings in New Orleans, acting and music (I notice the comment about the musical score in other comments ... I remember that clearly) TV better well! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... someday Paramount may dig in its archives and release it on DVD!
