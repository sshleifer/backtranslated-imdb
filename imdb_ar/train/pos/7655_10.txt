Having not seen the film for nearly 20 years, I still admire its strong influence and excellent influence. Of course, one of Mr. Mickey Rooney is in fact an incredible role as the pioneer "killer" (in reference to another review here - the name of Orson Wells was named only Mickey Rooney as the best film actor). I also recall the vibrant result and nude black and white photography. I love the last line of Mick before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think the Stranglers have pulled it up to line in one of their songs - get a grip on yourself). This is a wonderful movie and a movie buried in darkness. Let's get it out! Side note - Film Review recently published a great book about Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", produced two years ago "Last Mile" and Mickey Rooney. Another delirium of intense performance is sympathetic to Mick. Perhaps it is the beginning of a wave of appreciation for some really superior cinematic performances.
