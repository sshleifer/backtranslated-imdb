For the attention of Chuck Davis and Amy: I saw Lady Phantom Lady many years ago, when I was not a jazz musician. There is an exhibition that will run until the end of June at the new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY in Paris, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, and should not be missed, with special entertainment excerpts from nine jazz movies, including the famous drum sequence of PHANTOM LADY. I saw Jane Krupa - and Elisha Kook Jr. - in almost every aspect of their film, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Kook Jr. was promoted in the film. That was some progress, because in most of his other appearances he was killed (mainly in The Howard Hawks' The Big SLEEP). 2. Croppa may be called Cook in PL. I was able to get to know his style, since he had already graduated from Tom Tom (and abuse) at the beginning of his career - specifically in the SING series, SING and SING in Hollywood 1937 - and finally got everything possible from the French word "la caisse" claire ". 3. PL sequence, at least as shown in the museum, is uncensored. Carrie Carraso, Paris, France
