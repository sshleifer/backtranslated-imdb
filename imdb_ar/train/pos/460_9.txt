It is a series of great new crimes, involving three top British TV contractors (Dennis Waterman, James Bolam and Allon Armstrong), where retired investigators have been brought back to help cleanse old issues under Amanda Redman's career-focused career. The three strange and turbulent policemen make a remarkable team, applying 20-year-old detection methods to the police force, which has come a long way since then - sometimes with their influence and, at times, in the panic of their senior officers. The three are photographed with sympathy and warts and all. There are wonderful comic scenes, some of them very touching, where each of the three must reconcile with the age and legacy of his past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the six-part series (we promised another series next year), both characters evolved. James Bolam can not be reconciled with the sudden death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his role as a kid. Even the obsession of Alon Armstrong is helped by his new friends in the fight against the demons of his past - and continue to take medicine! Amanda Redman has to face the very familiar conflict between life and career. The lines of the story were interesting, though largely dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But the interaction between four of the best British actors made the series unacceptable.
