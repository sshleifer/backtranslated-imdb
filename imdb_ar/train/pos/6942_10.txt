In the 1950s the age restrictions for films in Brazil were: No restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Westerners were usually allowed to be 10 years old, and when they had more violence, they would go to 14 years, but it was rare to see the West bound for less than 18 years. Winchester 73 was one of these, I think this explains very well how I consider this film different from the average. Hero, James Stewart was fighting against his brother who killed their father. He was looking for revenge and seemed shocked, away from the ordinary good man. Anthony Mann tried different forms of this type of character in the following films with Stuart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from being virtuous, continued to follow the man who stayed with the gun. Dan Doria in the role of Dean Waco Johnny is one of those great bad guys who will always remember them. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with Venice, is one of the best stories of the West. It was due to be converted to Fritz Lang, which did not materialize. When it was shown on Mann, it took a starting point from scratch again and did not take anything that was set up for Lang. With Winchester, Man created a different vision for the West, but still retains all his traditions. Winchester is still a wonderful film that can be seen again and again, but nothing compares to the impression he made on those who saw it when it was originally released.
