I've shown this movie several times here in college, and each time I introduce it, the number of people watching with me is growing exponentially ... plus the virgins, anyone I've ever shown to NEEDS to see again! It takes some time to get to him, but eventually the whole room screams, screams, screams and repeatedly crashes the dialogue and shares quite a whole experience in the film experience of Pia Zadura in The Lonely Lady! Which was filmed in an incompetent, poorly written, badly filmed way being thrown at you in a comprehensive attack classified as the most attractive thing I own (no small statement, no friends) .For me nothing compares 2 U and Pia ... I do not suppose I'm the only person who ever felt this way!
