Great booty !! This is for the people who watched the movie !! <br /> <br /> Commentators have addressed the main theme of "honor" in the film, and many comparisons with "Braveheart". I will refer to some things about this film that I have not seen other comments to mention: <br /> <br /> This film contains a different procedure from abortion. The first character of the pregnancy is the friend of the villain (Ruth), and when he suggests abortion coldly, remember that it is too late. It is shameful to put it ("I must have a bastard bastard.") He leads to suicide in a later scene. The second character who found herself pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after her rape of Ruth's character (and at least one sexual scene with her husband Rob). Late in the film, as Rob leaves for a final confrontation with Ruth, Mary asks what she should do about the suspect pregnancy, in a way that suggests abortion. "It's not the child's fault," Rob says in a noble tone, then mentions what he thinks should be the name, girl or boy. I find that this "pro-life" attitude by the hero is from non-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment - not a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Another related subject is the character of Ruth, a bastard, a person who is not sure who his father was, and who has some kind words for his mother, even though he wears a photograph of her hanging from his neck. Is it a coincidence that Ruth (devoid of family stability) is the definition of psychological walking, while Rob is the strong husband / father figure, and of course the hero. In the last sword fight between Rob and the villain (Ruth), the last last slices deeply across the chest - the left side of the chest, on the heart. The employer and the false father figure (John Hurt's character) carry the image of the mother in his hand and look at it, before taking it from the neck of the dead Ruth. <br /> <br /> Also what I find interesting is the direction of the rape scene, which was not entirely graphic but was not so out of the camera and implicitly. I found it surprising that it was to a certain extent a depiction of the truth, as Mary had convincingly demonstrated the characteristics of someone undergoing this ordeal and the post-traumatic stress (as we now call it). My point is that the rape was not exciting or implicit, which I find an interesting middleway for Hollywood to take. <br /> <br /> In the final fighting scene, I have to correct a previous comment: The Roth chose to be a rapper (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon chosen by Rob Ho is Claymore. Someone was doing his duty in this whole scene. Roth will have the upper hand in such a position, but of course Claymore is a clear Scottish weapon. The most surprising thing for me (as a duel and a little read on the subject) is that this latest sword battle is one of the most convincing films ever: actors seem to be trying to kill each other - not the usual slanted lines of the opponents' code we see most Movie Battles (including Battle of Opening Movies). Even more realistic of history, Ruth is seen several times using a double-edged sword as a push weapon, that is the purpose of design! (The edges of the rapper were sharp, but a strong weapon primarily using the edges used primarily to penetrate the crowd of competitors.) Rob Claymore uses wide slant lines, because it is intentional in design. The battle goes down as I expect - Ruth wins effectively. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing the gun of Ruth (more symbolism) and beating him dead with a strong slash. <br /> <br /> People, it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in the Battle of the Sword Film. <br /> <br /> I will also note that for any reason, I remember 1995 (the year of issue) clearly as a time of mistrust of the US government. It's clear that Hollywood has been caught up in that, with both Rob Roy and Braveheart being released, and I think anti-government tendencies are why both films get a lot of comparison. <br /> <br /> I think the different perspective this film offers is refreshing for hungry movie enthusiasts, fed up with the same old messages, not hidden from Hollywood.
