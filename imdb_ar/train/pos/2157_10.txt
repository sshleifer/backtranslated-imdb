Okay. As you can see this is one of my favorite films if not my favorite. This is a very fun personal drama. The main character is a businessman stuck in the mindset "the same thing, a different day". A woman looks sad from a studio window dancing from his train every day and wonders about her and decides to learn more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to learn that she is not the coach. From there, he connects him to four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing and mysterious women. <br /> <br /> There is no illicit practice (or any sex), and how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This film was re-produced with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new film, while attractive, was not as enjoyable as the original. The film has never become so great in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars because it was aired on television in Japan (the films can not be made on television or are not eligible for Oscar nominations). She has won many awards in Japan for best film, actor, director, etc. for the Oscar Awards.
