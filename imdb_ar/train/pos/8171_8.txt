I realize that this review will shock me by film critics who are patrolling this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is already a really good movie. Acting is not always first class, but the excitement is good and the story is good. In addition you see Linda Hoffman fools. I'm not an expert in this area, but the trend seems good and the plot is logical. Corbin makes a great creepy dentist. Do the dentists what the jaws do for sharks ... nest. She obviously had a fairly limited budget, but they managed to achieve what they could, and they developed personalities well (those that matter). <br /> <br /> The end.
