I can agree with other comments that there was not a huge amount of history discussed in the film but it was not a documentary! It was meant for entertainment and I think it did a very good job in it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them looked misplaced. Like everything suddenly, will be thrown out, but I watched the story and the relationship between the families later and found it good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not the re-enactments of the last century brought to light periods of great and very important of the decade. I found it very entertaining and well worth the time to watch.
