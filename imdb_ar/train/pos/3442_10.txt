This film leaves mind thinking and tries to analyze the story. I also can not understand why people are moving this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Jerry Brockheimer, this movie may not suit you. <br /> <br /> This film offers a high degree of realism. Performance of actors and actresses is an exam. Not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound. Special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera action is excellent, and the music is very good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It leaves your body sedated, like Constant Garderner.The has a direct talent, and certainly not an affiliate.
