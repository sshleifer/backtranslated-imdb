Whenever I see most reviews it is called "Eddie Murphy's Disorder". These critics want to take a look at some of the things he is doing these days, and they may relax their position later ... "The Golden Child" is not high-speed entertainment, but thanks to some actors it breathes new life into old cliches, His roles. I do not understand the extreme lack of "love" for his efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the institution grew up with the knockout, the adventures of the subtle excitement? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones. It is unfair to make this person a scapegoat when the greatest sin is perhaps total harm. There is no error necessarily in trying to take advantage of trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is silly, but even the occasional observer must be able to understand that "absurdity" is where Hollywood's idea of ​​Sufism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the public has tourist guides at hand to show them mysterious scenes. Michael Richie and Eddie Murphy are charging this capacity bill. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the trip.
