First, I will be the first to admit that the scapegoat itself is slightly superior. Toned down maybe a less spirited scarecrow made the film less cowardly. But in general I think it is one of the best movies B. Tiffany Shepis is very cool, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the most important important factor, there are many other films to watch. But here she feels the evil heat, especially in the end as she walks away from the scarecrow that has engulfed her. Richard Elfman is doing great work like the Mayor of Honor and as a drunk friend. Yes, it's a low-budget movie. But of all I've seen, this is certainly one of my best favorites.
