Wonderful. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost complete and seems to be the only film written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories. <br /> <br /> The representation is bright. Renying Zhou was an amazing Doggie - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was fun - just as believable as the old, lax old. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was extremely effective, as it was directed without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If more films like this are made in Hollywood or Hong Kong, they are family friendly, well-represented, well written, and well-directed, close to the perfect jewel.
