Although others commented that this video is just a modified version of "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you see the original shows, you'll find that the dialogue has been edited from this video version. I found this video version much better because the viewer and fonts were added to it. I would say if you want to watch the demo in its original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have a lot to offer to the fan than the original episodes that are presented on the DVD now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had scenes from Galactica 1980 more than the actual broadcast itself. Overall, this figure is 10 because it gives you a lot more to enjoy than networks wanted to show in the time they provided to producers.
