This adaptation of the movie Pearl S. Pac is definitely a classic. The real Hollywood epic, containing all the things that the wonderful Hollywood movie has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, joy, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that bothers me. I know it was a sign of the times, but none of the main characters in the game played the role of Asian representatives. Paul Muni was a great actor and did a great job like Wang Long, a farm owner in China. Louis Renier plays Ulan. She does not look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but Anna should have put Mai Wong in this role. I know why they did not, Ms. Renier is very good at the film, but they barely tried to make it look "authentic." Still a great movie, especially if you read the book (I did high school, decades ago). Must see, just look behind casting. I think you can.
