I work with children from 0? 6 years old and they all love Doodlebops. The Doodlebops are vibrant, lively and attractive. As soon as they start singing, "We Doodle Bobs We Doodle Bobs We Doodle Pops Oh Oh Oh Come Come On And Join The Fun Because We Laugh And Sing All Day" It's almost impossible not to join them in a song. Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of colors and fun. Every show is an adventure, Doodlebops does not try to change the world with preaching messages All they do is fun while sorting out the challenges of everyday life that the little baby Doodlebops may have a refreshing and high-powered alternative to regular children's television programs.
