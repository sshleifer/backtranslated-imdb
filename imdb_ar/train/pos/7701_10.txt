This has always been one of my favorite films, and will always be so. Over the past few years, I became obsessed with science fiction in the 1950s / 1960s, trying to gather everything better than I did at the time. I like a lot of things about them from their tendency to how to correct some of them technically. Brilliant colors and collections make me go too. It's a pity when they re-produce some of these good old movies; they're always urging them, - just see a re-done recently on the day the earth was fixed, it's the absolute garbage !! Forbidden Planet is one of the most standard satellite films of all time, and now they are trying to reproduce it as well, and they are thrilled to think about the new format. In my opinion, some things, such as brilliant classic films, should be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of the great attempts of simple storytelling, giving people suspense in the process. As soon as they add all the technical details we have now, it seems that the film has become more of a dog than a sausage factory in Hollywood - nothing special at all. By the way, I noticed that the astronaut costume in the Planet Vorbidine was also used in the "Outer Space Queen"! This only tells you that the budgets were a little lower at the time, right? Hi, less money and better movies, hmm .... <br /> <br /> Fantastic performances in this film from Leslie Nielsen, in Dangerous Role, Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors) Holiman, and of course Robbie the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are wonderful, and the story story is not out of reach. This is a fantastic science fiction experience!
