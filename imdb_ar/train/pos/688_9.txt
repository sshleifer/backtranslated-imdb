It was a pleasure to see this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, and I was very impressed. It's clear that Tess Nanavati is a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she can do what I did with the budget of this film, I'm very keen to see what she can do with a big picture. Glory to the representatives of their wonderful performance (that little girl was gold), and to the composer of music. My row of your boat exploded away. Very creative film everywhere .... I really hope to see it appear on the video or DVD because I buy it in the second. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
