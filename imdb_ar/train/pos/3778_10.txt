The first film had little ambition, so there was nothing to stick to the screen. It was a bad copy of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. Once you accept that Bill & Ted is a result, humor can only be accessed by the audience for a long time before it collapses. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is the only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> According to today's standards, this is more fun. This was avoided when he was released, sad given that more talent was involved in the first time. We get the "Face / Off" photographer, the editor of "Fugitive", a production designer from Early Burton, and the sound designer at "Matrix". <br /> <br /> The writers made up their shallow first picnic with something deep. Since the masses and the public refused, the director decided that the style was too severe. Not so, it fits the material. Such as "Death has become her" and "Catch 22", this dares to be smart, but we love our films "simple" so we do not buy them. Maybe because this dared to be different is why it took 12 products to pull it. What is very good? <br /> <br /> - Nice self-reference towards Keanu; from airhead to Christ. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Goose hates his creations as much as he hates his peers, he makes his hatred. The Evil B & T and Good Robot Uses have the same vocabulary as their origin: fewer copies and lower language value. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​"duplication". This is not evident anywhere other than photographic styles, a lot of high and low angles. They even use Roy Brooksmith of "Total Recall" to confirm this point. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​"choices." I do not know where this started in this genre (probably "Ghostbusters"), but it is used well here. They even sum up in 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Self-reference film, even present in the game against Death. This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the premier magazine cover at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie". It is also astonishing how Death and Numulus were the villains in the sequel of "cruel death" and "deadly weapons". <br /> <br /> I still have some minor lice, but nothing compared to the original. Music and movies are so different means no sense why many spin around the first scripts - especially in the teen market. Carlin is a wonderful comedy actor, but he is lost in these films. Also, despite all these bold efforts, even breaking down gay jokes, they can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, although they look like Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this film we got Peeves and Butt Head. "We are in heaven and we stole only three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Mean Range of Materials
