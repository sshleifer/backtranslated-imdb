So I do not spoil it for you, I'll be very brief. There are some funny and funny lines of representation from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard School Meade (Brian White) discovers that he does not know how much he thinks of people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida because of his training period because Mia's girlfriend left him to work as a television producer. The great resident (Wood Harris), helped by the "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana), quickly reached him. They help protect his career and show him the wider potential of being a compassionate doctor rather than a player who just wants to make money (as many of my friends seem to do for the average).
