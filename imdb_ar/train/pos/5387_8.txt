Even in the twenty-first century, carrying a child is dangerous: women have miscarriage and premature birth. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme "Life Begins": A Look at the "Hard Case" ward at the maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought from prison (what crime she committed not related to the plot) to give birth; inconsistent with the fact that she will have to have her baby after childbirth. She is in a suite with many other women who share their joys and pains with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the leader, outstanding performance, as usual, was presented by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner B's women in the 1930s, playing a big part in supporting roles and sometimes taking the lead in B movies. (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several versions of the Torchy B-movie series.) Here Farrell plays as expected and does not want her children, because they will not object the way. She does everything in her power to get through the nurses, including the liquor smuggling to the wing (this course during the days of prevention), drinking like a fish - obviously they never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome again in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most of the films in the early 1930s, women are not the ones who bear fools stumbling in the way of the heroic men - this attitude was reversed, with the parents' parents returning to piles of jelly. (The veteran actor Frank Macko watched as one of the expectant parents). "Life Begins", being an early modern, deals with the subject with a fair blood of melodrama, certainly, but it is a charming little movie. Turner presented him as a classic, albeit irregularly; I saw that she only appeared in a few days to honor Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to display it when it appears.
