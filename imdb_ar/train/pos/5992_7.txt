I admit that I had no idea what to expect before offering this high-styled piece. Treatment for the zombie virus or colds may be for all I know. I started with fantastic photos, small excerpts that attract your attention and cause your imagination. As they continued, I quickly learned through the voice of the sums what was going on. Nice little noir story that I felt was not a waist for a few minutes of my time. Small clues given to the audience through visual images at the beginning provide a sense of accomplishment while assembling the scheme. Along with a nice twist in the end its a fantastic overall. The result, although not bad, gave the film almost a sense of video music. I felt a little dated, do not add anything to enhance the story. I felt some very exciting performances but perfectly suited to the overall feeling of the piece. I walk away from this very satisfied. I received a lot of information in a short period of time, but with great editing and editing, I did not feel rushed or pushed. great work!
