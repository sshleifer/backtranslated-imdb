I think this movie was very good. Some parts were vulgar but this is understandable because it was manufactured more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the film was presented by Michelle Morgan, who played Milly convincingly. Jack Halley is also really good like Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a fan of Frank Sinatra, I think it was very good in this film. If you want to get a passion, on top of musical comedy, the high and high is the right movie for you. <br /> <br />
