I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Bert Reynolds and Dum Dweizie make a wonderful pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite song is "You Can not Keep a Good Dog" and that song is about sharing, I think it's called "What's Your Property". This was the last film with Judith Parsi, who played Anne Marie's role. My favorite character is Charlie but I find Itchy very fun to listen to. Although some of the scenes I've felt are scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream, while Carvis scares me. Other characters like King Gator found it really funny. The end was adorable and she was really sad, made me cry a bit. I give this movie 7/10.
