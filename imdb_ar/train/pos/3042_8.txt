The film moved everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the great landing scene in the Philippines. It was on the beach of Littie where General MacArthur earned his fame ?? <br /> <br /> Above all, Gregory Beg has won his portrayal of the great general ?? It's the step, the shoulders, the intensity ?? This is what the two men share: intensity, total absorption, dedication ?? With MacArthur was the army? With Beck was to challenge acting? An Oscar winner for "To Kill a Mockinbird," an Oscar candidate for Keys to the Kingdom, The Yearling, Gentleman's Agreement, and Twelve O'Clock High? The loss of memory to a crusader journalist; from a troubled armed fighter to a maniacal lawyer; from the Torah of David to Captain Horatio Horn Blour? He brought them all his unique vision, personality, sincerity, warmth and love, especially his humor ?? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" stands on his back with the "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep," says the president, "because my people will discover that I can not swim." Then come to the sound of the sincere Beck: "My people will find that I can not walk on the water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur," Beck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we felt the feelings of MacArthur: We knew his anger and happiness and understanding the relationship with his entire family ??
