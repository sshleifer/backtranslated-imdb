This is one of the best films that was produced in 2002. It may not be the best film, but it looks better, it has a wonderful representation and is ideally directed by Sam Mendes, who first appeared with American Beauty. <br /> <br /> He tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoeklin) on one of his jobs. Michael Rooney (Paul Newman) believes that things will be fine but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) puts both his father and Michael, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Lee) and his second son. Michael believes that Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends Harrell Maguire (Jude Law) to accomplish the job. Since Michael is a respectable man within the organization, he is trying to win some friends who can help him, including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Toatchi). <br /> <br /> In a way, "The Road to Hell" is considered a record film for a band but it is well made you almost can not see it. This film is good in its design for production, its artistic direction, sound and music, and most of all in the cinema. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the result is very certain. Hoechlin is not a troublesome child, and Law and Newman know how to act, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on the comic, this movie is much better than you expect, although it contains flaws. It belongs to the best films in this genre. Sometimes, there are events where you realize you've seen them many times before, but for some reason, you also feel refreshed at the same time. The viewer helps between Hanks and Child Hutchinson in this area. Watch this movie, which will sometimes look familiar but is quite new in many areas.
