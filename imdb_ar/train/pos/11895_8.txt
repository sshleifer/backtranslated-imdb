Tea Leoni plays the role of dangerous photographer Nora Wild in a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost. She wants legal photography, but she is hired to work in the popular press. Her boss was played by the wonderful and divine Taylor Taylor. The presentation was well written most of the time. TEA Nora began to evolve into an unforgettable character, but the network did not support comedy yet. Even when they brought in George and chanted slogans, they made unnecessary changes in cast and characters. The show was good at first and the audience was used to it, but then the network installed it as a bad cosmetic surgery.
