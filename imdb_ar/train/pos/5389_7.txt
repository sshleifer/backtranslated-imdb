His expected wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the prison ward at the beginning of a 20-year sentence for breaking a loser he may have come to; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to discourage public sympathy, which is so good that it is not true, Sympathetic and beautiful in looking at them of course.
