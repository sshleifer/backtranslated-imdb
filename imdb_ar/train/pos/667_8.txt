Although I've been a fan of Peter Ware for a long time, I did not watch any of his Australian films until I saw The Last Wave. A pleasant surprise was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five indigenous people accused of killing other indigenous people. For David's peers, there is a clear state of drunken disorder and they believe they should plead guilty and make a quick judgment on them. But David believes there is a mystery under murder, linked to tribal rites. As he continues to achieve, he learns not only about his clients but about himself. <br /> <br /> Detecting more will spoil one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. I can only say that this film is going in directions that no one would expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this film a wonderful film: Chamberlain's representation, for example; but also the performances of David Golbilel, who plays the role of an indigenous young man presenting David to tribal secrets; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, Plays from aborigines who is a spiritual guide. Relations between these three characters form the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also a Yower method that suggests a supernatural presence in the film. David dreams of the future. Australia is experiencing bad weather, with storms, colds and even mysterious black rains that may be no more than pollution. But it is also linked to David's case. How it relates is one of the largest film detection. Among the few events in which Weir succeeded in creating an atmosphere of panic and persecution, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's degree is superb, especially the use of didgeridoo. Photography is also very good. Russell Boyd, a longtime DP World who won an Oscar in 2004 for a master and captain, depicts a dark, creepy world filled with mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find it remarkable that for a film focusing on indigenous people, it does not appear to turn into an indictment against white culture or a naive celebration of their traditions, such as Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This film is so clever that it is not so simplistic. <br /> <br /> It may be frustrating at times, and it may irritate viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything logical; but for those who do not mind some weirdness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
