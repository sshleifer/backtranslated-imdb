I did not like Chandni Bar from the director himself. <br /> <br /> I have not seen his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is well done. Sounds real. As Satya did from RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of so-called high society is the film's summary. In the midst of all this disease, it is difficult to live a normal life as does the protagonist Konkana Sen. Dangerous film, can not be seen with children or expecting wives. Page 3 of the newspapers is the usual place to report on activities in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in more filth and then reported. How this page is also displayed in Business. Paying to event management companies to arrange parties and make rich people, but not famous overnight, by clicking on photos with celebrities invited to the ceremony. <br /> <br /> Western culture has crept into the high-profile Mumba society. The film shows it boldly, and there are no restrictions. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
