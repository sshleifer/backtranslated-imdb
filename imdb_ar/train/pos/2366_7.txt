This film (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) was presented to Jeff Wincott for the first time. The introduction was wonderful. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter. Scenes of motion in this wonderful film! There are a lot of them too, by the way. The recruitment battle at headquarters HQ Peacekeepers is particularly good. There is something about one person who outperforms the crap of a group of people that are really fun. For the rest of the crew: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this fit (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He is a superb fighter-like fighter, and was a good contender for Wincott in this film.
