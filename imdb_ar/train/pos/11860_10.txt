This movie has everything. It is a classic portrayal of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is one of the thousands who have had a chance to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic but extremely meticulous portrayal of the Miami drug empire is stunning. Bryan Dibalma does a great job directing this picture, so much so that the viewer gets involved with both the story, as well as every character in the film. Since Tony's pressure is very strong and credible, Bryan DiBalma has created the raw talent revealed by Steven Bauer (Manny and Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Sister Tony), Robert Loggia (Frank and Tony Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer Frank). I enjoyed every minute watching this film, and I still watch it every week. This year, which marks the 20th anniversary of this classic film of crime, I truly believe that within another 20 years, people will still point to this film in astonishing numbers. With other crime films so dramatic, I find this film a shock to the regime.
