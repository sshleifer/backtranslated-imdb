After watching all the films of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers and others in the fifties, it is very interesting to see this film with a new perspective of director Ang Lee. Lawrence attack scene, Kansas is great. It turns out that the romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire is one of the best parts, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is great as a bad guy. All the time, this film makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters do not know whether it will continue in the coming hours. Definitely worth seeing.
