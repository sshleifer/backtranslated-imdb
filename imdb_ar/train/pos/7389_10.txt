Awards can not show the satisfaction of all people. Obviously, if you do not win your favorite movies, you will say that the show was not good. This is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment from the history of Hollywood: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first appearance at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Alan often left the awards as self-incarnate and meaningless, and he never showed up - despite winning many accolades. Held, the nation continues to mourn the loss of life in the collapse of World Trade Centers in New York. When it was time to pay homage to New York City, they decided to show a video of the great movie moments that make up the City of Cities. Then the announcer simply said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar winner, director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place broke out with a very long welcome. Finally, the entertainment industry got applause for the man from New York who usually avoids Hollywood. When the applause ended, Woody applied some mythical memories to the situation. <br /> <br /> Some highlights: <br /> <br /> "Thank you very much - it compensates for the barbaric search." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted to return the Oscars." Panic because the pawn shop has been out of business for a long time and I had no way to recover anything. "<br /> <br /> But that was not the case. I could not solve it because my film was not nominated for anything this year. Then they hit me - maybe they were calling for an apology. "<br /> <br /> Allen also revealed why he had been oblivious to Oscar's lifelong dislike for this special night. <br /> <br />" For New York City, I was doing anything. So, I got Tux and fell down here, "Allen said. <br /> <br />" It's a great and great movie city. It was a wonderful, exciting and exciting background for films and remains a wonderful city. "<br /> <br />
