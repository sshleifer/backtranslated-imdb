As a surrealist (in art and cinema), I was delighted to discover this film on the International Finance Corporation. He's definitely a guard. Most other reviews tell the general plot (and not all are correct) so I will not bother to afford anyone with it. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds caused by Anna's impending illness, the way she was able to associate with another person after he was "lonely" and finally with her family, which I think is still a little bit turbulent. It can only be called a horror movie because it contains scary but fictional scenes (with little hint of "reaching adulthood" just because Anna is a teenager who hates "boys"). I warmly recommend it to those who appreciate their imagination.
