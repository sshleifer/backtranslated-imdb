The film is a little "slim" after reading the book, but it is still one of the greatest films ever produced. Cheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is "really". It does a great job of expressing feelings from the book to the film. There are not many movies that attract a sense of the book as well as the mother's night.
