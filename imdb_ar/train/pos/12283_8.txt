The photography of this production in the budget supply is very bad. Muddy colors and brown photography have a very 80ish look to it. Often the direction and editing are completely uninformed and resemble the TV too. * * * At first it seems that the film only wants to torture his viewers through the mysterious images of sex and violence. The degree of Hans Zimmer is also a simple and gentle work of this exaggerated and uneducated composer. <br /> <br /> But if you're ready to watch the movie more you're rewarded with a very touching family story, a kind of European version of the Edna Ferber family. At first you wonder why Clara married this stupid guy, so his character gets more depth and background one can judge him. Clara presents the spiritual lesson of the film, a wonderful and moving statement against the horrific events in her country. Her daughter, who is a young granny Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and finally tries to live it. The way the plot was constructed by the end reflected the beginning. All actors are doing a wonderful job too. I was wondering "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" All the time, but of course, Winona Rider was really young! <br /> <br /> In general, this film made me really want to read the book.
