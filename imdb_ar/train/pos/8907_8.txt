I watched this movie in the middle of the night on On Demand the other night, without knowing what to expect. I have heard about this film, but I have not expressed any opinions about it. <br /> <br /> I must say, I was impressed with what I saw. I was shocked in some parts and I remember sure jumping in my seat several times. <br /> <br /> Blob was scary. Now, look at a jar of gel and wonder if she will push with my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was just as good as Steve Andrews, the film's hero. I also liked the old man at first. <br /> <br /> For the horror film of the 1950s, this was very good even according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
