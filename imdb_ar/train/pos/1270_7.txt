This film is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, the film's story and concept are really good and tense and have some beautiful transformations. On the other hand, on the other hand, everything is very slow, without style and not involved. I still consider that "Just Cause" is simply a film above average simply because of the cast. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery may have been wrong in his role. I mean he is not really believable as the main "hero" and father of a small daughter (played by a silent young man Scarlett Johansson by the way) and Kate Kappshaw's husband. I feel it was simply too big to have a credible role in it. But Sean Connery is of course a wonderful actor and that's the only reason why he can still carry the film as well as he does. But of course he was helped by a very strong support team made up of representatives like Lawrence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Betty, Hope Lange, Lynn Theben and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good but some of them are of little use at the same time, a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is just a great role in his role as a mentally retarded killer. It's really chilling and it behaves beautifully. He usually does not play this kind of cruel role in movies, so he is really surprised at his role in this role. His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this film. However, given the fact that the story is listed without much elegance and complexity, none of the characters in the film do not work well because they seem too far away. <br /> <br /> It's really a way of telling stories. Which kills the entire film its beautiful potential. Ernie Gleacher directs the film in a simple way and keeps the pace very low at times. For this reason, as viewers, we never engage in the story or any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad, because "Just Cause" has more than enough potential. Fantastic collection and wonderful story with some unexpected transformations and turns into something that does not look like anything. The actors and story are the only reason why this film continues to raise a story above the average, and it is likely that it will continue to be pleased. However, it is an eternal shame that the film does not exist in telling its story and style, otherwise this film may be a classic in this genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
