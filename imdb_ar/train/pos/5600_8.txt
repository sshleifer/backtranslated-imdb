This is my film type. I am fascinated by strange mental nightmares and this film is so completely. But it is also a dark comedy. Although I often see it as a horror / thrill, there will be others who might see it as a dramatic black comedy. <br /> <br /> But in both cases, it's a fantastic descent into madness. I ended up careful, but what an end! It leaves the viewer a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> The powerful performances, the intricate and detailed plot, the terrific scenario filled with horror and humor, and the strange atmosphere make this film a movie worth watching. <br /> Personally, I think I'll need to watch this several times to capture and understand all the finer details inside. But it's such a film that it would be a pleasure and not a duty to do.
