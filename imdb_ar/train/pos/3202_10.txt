I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do they think it's sooo bad ect. It is not worse than anything else out there. I personally think that "Soldier" is a wonderful movie, much better than most other films of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Why I like Soldier: Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, David Webb Peoples, great visual effects, and Paul Anderson. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best work I have ever seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the fun of "Mortal Kombat" and "The Incredible Horizon of Events."
