I always look forward to this movie when it is on TV. I must get a DVD I think. The group of different species of people is wonderful. Tell me that anyone can be a dancer if he tries hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. It is very strange but full of emotions. It is a perfect movie with great dancing. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to see them go to Blackpool. It would make a perfect sequel if they had. But I think it leaves it to your imagination for what can happen. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a new version of Hollywood. I'm not sure if you want. I do not really enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere matches the original more than Lopez. I have a feeling that the new version is not simple and innocent.
