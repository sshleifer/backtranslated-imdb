I remember this game. He was always sitting on the shelves on her own, until one day she decided to try something new for change and got this game. I stared at it, because it was the first game ever for my PS1 device that has 4 cylinders. When I play it, I could not shut down the console seriously. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is very good and twisted, and it is almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII story, and this is difficult to accomplish. When you play the game, you get bogged down in incredible characters that it is just a PS1 game, as if you were similar to a movie. I think it should be converted into a film. <br /> <br /> This game is very bad and hardly anyone has heard of it, barely played by one or loved it, because it is one of those games that sit on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% mark off sitting on them, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them show that it's really good. Hickey, so I got to Final Fantasy VII, and I look at the catalog, and I find it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG game better than most Square Enix games, amazingly. I would not be surprised if it was manufactured by Square Enix but it is not. Almost no games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but this game is. But what really bothers me is why they are so well known and not praised, which should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are good for PS1, but what do you expect from them? It is a PS1 man game, which was made in 1999. The story I have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats the seventh. The characters are amazing, and share a lot with them, and their actions. <br /> <br /> There are definitely 10 out of 10. Definitely worth more praise, and a very good RPG shell by another company other than Enix Square.
