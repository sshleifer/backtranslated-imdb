What a good movie! Made Men is a wonderful movie with lots of twists and turns. James Belushi is as good as the hood of a former driver who stole 12 million from his boss, who has to defend the gangs and hills of his wife and local police (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, hop on board and enjoy the trip. 8 of 10
