After trailing for half a year, I finally found a copy that was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> I'm not disappointed because I'm one of the SMAP fans who are dying hard and who need to see all their work and I finally got to see a hot movie called Guru. But I could not believe that Guru was forced to produce a film that way. In the same respectable now, I'm sure he's crumbling that he made this film. However, they found the perfect person to look awkward and ill and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe he filmed this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many incredible parts that he really made such a movie .... hahaha .... /> <br /> But I'm glad to see it. Praise be to Allah.
