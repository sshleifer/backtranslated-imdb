This is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but it's as excellent as Emma Woodhouse. Allan Caming is as wonderful as Elton Reverand, the sister of Emma Thompson, Sophie, Hestery and Miss Bates. Check out Jeremy Northam like Mr. Knightley. What a nice guy! Who said you need to have sex and violence in a movie to make it good, Emma never saw. I think that's what separates it from many others - it's neat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie you can watch with the whole family, or find a love story for yourself, look for no more. Emma is this movie. With beautiful setting, brilliant costumes, and a wonderful team (I have mentioned gorgeous Jeremy Northham?), Emma is the perfect ten!
