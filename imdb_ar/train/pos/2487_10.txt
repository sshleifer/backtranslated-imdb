I must say that given Hamlet from the student's point of view, the Pranach version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to maintaining his loyalty to the original text should be commended. It helps the game appear on screen, and makes it easier for people with text to watch, as we did while studying, to follow and analyze text. <br /> <br /> One of the things I have heard I have criticized several times is casting the big Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers get to know characters more easily, rather than having actors who all seem to be a helpful voice in the confusion usually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Also, his previous memories help erase many of the mystery in the text. Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ovelia really went and why Fortenbras was at the castle in the end. All in all, this version not only contains some great performances by familiar and unfamiliar actors with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that one does not need to be a PhD in English literature to understand and enjoy it.
