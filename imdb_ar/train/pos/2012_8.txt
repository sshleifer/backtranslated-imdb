This is one of the best to absolutely. Great music and some funny pieces. I laugh every time in Millie, the maid pretending to be skilled, holding her fresh skin while chatting, and polishing the furniture relentlessly with her while chatting. I can never go beyond her French accent because it is a problem because they are trying to get rid of her as the daughter of the president. <br /> <br /> Seeing Teen Mile Tormy and the very small Frank Sinatra singing is great fun. I saw my mother Frank Sinatra in a theater at the same time that this film appeared. She said they could not get rid of "Bobby Soxers" among the films (in those days you did not have to leave them among the shows). This film shows you the attractiveness and attractiveness of young Frank and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. Victor Burg gets a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet and simple story. very fun.
