I was really shocked to see a number of reviews by this movie's lambast. This film was not intended to be a "deeply thought" film, which seems to be the vast majority of reviewers think it should be. In fact, it seems that if a film does not produce a life-changing vision, a deep, twisted, perplexing plot, they will classify it as 1 or 2. Do not move a movie because you do not like sex, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was a flicker of motion / comedy, and that's all it was meant to be. For Action / Comedy, it was done very well. I was actually surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed it, since I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx, and they have an excessive use plot. <br /> <br /> This plot was not fantastic, using the usual criminal out of prison, being thrown into a bad plot while trying to clean up his do (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hook, 48 hours, etc., etc.) Warmed up by a bit of technological sophistication. Now the "bad guys" are actually the "bad guys" and the real "bad guys" are "obsessed." <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fox actually plays a convincingly funny spirit, while at the same time clever to some extent the main character serious, and did not try to transcend the comic side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep plot such as "Matrix" or a drama like "From Mice and Men" this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the hard movement, excellent fast-paced photography, and changing humor from time to time, you will not be disappointed. I used to classify it at about 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it 10 to try to raise the score to what it should be. <br /> <br />
