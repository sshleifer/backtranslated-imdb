The events of September 11, 2001, do not require additional humanitarian attention in the form of follow-up training of the rising firefighter or the advance of the French brothers. In my opinion, it was better to leave this. I think the directors tried hard, maybe they felt that today's events need a story as background. The suspension of a police officer - "aint f *** ing Disneyworld" - is appropriate. <br /> <br /> However, it is an attractive watch to shoot events. The directors were in all the right places at the right times, and no other shots of the day matched what they saw.
