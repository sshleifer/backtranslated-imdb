Often laughs at laughing loudly at sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills sucks laughter from the zip more than you see since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. The story of the plot is centered on two drivers who bet on any one of them who can hire the employer (whether single or close to be single women, very sexy - Bisit and Waronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will repay his debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the tough guy with his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of gruesome dialogue, somatic humor is somewhat sick, etc. But a lot of comedy is just under the surface. Bartel is not forgotten as a very strange member of the family and ends up getting his teenage daughter-in-law in a "missionary trip" for a long year to Africa. <br /> <br /> Fun and fun.
