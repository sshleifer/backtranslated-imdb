Another reason to watch this wonderful film is Florence Rice. Florence Who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits were running on screen. I soon discovered who was Florence Rice, a real beauty that turns out to be simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping sweeping group. From 1939, at a different time but here lies the magic. It takes you to another world. It starts as a light comedy but it becomes very dangerous. Florence Rice runs the series of comedy to the heroine. She is very happy, and at the same time strong, weak develops from girl to woman. See her facial expressions at the end of the film. I've made more than forty films, and I'll look for another thirty-nine. Alan Marshall is from the position of Flynn / Gabel and proves the perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel offer some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's / 40's, do not miss this show!
