I've seen this documentary twice - and although I'm a major filmmaker, most documentaries do not get my attention. But this film was mesmerizing. Almost every shot is perfect - it says much more than a soundtrack (not for this documentary). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras - Who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> The amazing and excellent choices of interviews - movie clips for a factory in China - make you feel like you're actually there. <br /> <br /> I am a conscious politician - I have read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this film that was a surprise to me. However, it has made me think a lot. <br /> <br /> I wish so much, that this world was a better place. <br /> <br /> There's a million director's fame - and thank you for making this movie too. <br /> I hope everyone sees it.
