The first hour or so of the film was mostly dull to say the least. However, it was then improved with the start of the Valentine's Day. Regardless of the evolution of the killer's identity in the end, the murder scene in a hot bath was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of the film. The scene in the park was filmed with Kate as well as the last scene ("twisting"). In those scenes, there was some real thrill and excitement and the murder scene in the hot tub had a bad advantage (the way a slant should be). The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of Gore.
