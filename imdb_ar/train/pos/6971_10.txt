Of course, this ordinary Battle Star Gallactica "Sci-Fi" fan will hate this. This kind of makes me happy. I do not like those fantasy scientific presentations especially Star Battles Gallactica and that's why I liked this show. <br /> <br /> Creators at the show got a lot of heat to make this (non-traditional science fiction) -fi way) and it was worth it. I read on a wiki that they want to please everyone including women and not just obsessed with science. <br /> <br /> This program may have been the most promising since Lost. The program contains the most interesting, smartest and deepest text in any show at a time, which is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I like most about the show is that it kind of plays like a great anime! From the young teenagers who run in the shooting guns, and even the very balanced and complex text, to the robots, this reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little better (most anime is very puzzling).
