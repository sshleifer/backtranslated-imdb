... Do not read any abstracts of the scheme because in words the plot may seem trivial, muted and useless. The film is excellent, acting by both Denzel and Dakota (will rise to the sky and trust me in it) is wonderful, and the plot raises concern. In fact "wonderful" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film depends only on real facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact adds to the shock I was facing during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and somewhat distorted films, you have not yet seen your favorite movie ... trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. Fantastic movie, watch it, rent it, buy it or anything else ... do not miss it
