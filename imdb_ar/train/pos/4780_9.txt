Always fancy this movie from the video cover. Eventually I got a tour to buy it for the fiver in the sale and what boy movie. The performance is simply stunning of all situations and has been beautifully photographed. Even at times from a distance, you can hardly hear what a dialogue is, as if you really are that distance that captures parts of the story. It's really moving, and often entertaining and very watchful. There is not much dialogue but it is portrayed in a way that you feel so much. A 9/10 from me. Must see.
