Post-feminist photography of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Alert the spoiler! <br /> <br /> This worn-out jewel tells the story of Flavia, a fifteen-year-old girl born in a convent surrounded by a Muslim warrior who fell as a human, not a satanic, character. <br /> <br /> Unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (explicitly mentioned in a scene where the bishop is surrounded by soldiers and monks). Flavia begins to ask questions explicitly to the society that it finds itself, and by overcoming a complete system of oppression, oppression and violence, it must end a tragedy not only for itself but for all around it. <br /> <br /> It was described as a piece of abandonment away from the truth. This film depicts the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of the insurgency and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> In the title of this piece, I have described it as "post-feminism". In the end, Flavia's victories must always be corrupted, humiliating and perverted by men. Until the end of the abominable Flavia, men are committed to men. (Women move away and monks only look fearlessly. <br /> <br /> With regard to the violence that has been much discussed: this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven by religious absence. The influence of the film, which would have mitigated the size of the film and allowed it to integrate into the patriarchal discourse it reveals, as well as a realistic image of the medieval society. <br /> <br /> It was beautifully filmed and brilliantly represented (especially by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), where it has a remarkable result by piovani and remains a challenge after all these years.
