Although I love the books of EE "Doc" Smith and David A. Kyles of Lensman, but the animation that relies on books loosely, is a fun game and fairly innovative. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to science fiction / fantasy fans, as some children on an isolated planet inherit inner powers and avenge their family's death, it is nonetheless fun. In addition, Lensman was the first animated animation using both hand-drawn and CG animations at the same time. Sure, it may look a bit old now, but it's still an innovation. If not for Lensman, none of this will happen at all (Personally, I think the computer graphics look better in live animation.) <br /> <br /> Too bad, they only released it on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the world (mostly in foreign and entirely different formats). I just wish they would release a movie and a TV series Lensman on DVD / VCD in every part of the world, not just certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worst rules! I only think it is stunning and stylish looking too.
