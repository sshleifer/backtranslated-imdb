Wonderful. Something of a surprise. Although there are drawbacks, it is better to expect that. <br /> <br /> Arcturus, a new spacecraft of about 3,000 passengers, was in the last days of its 16-day voyage to Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral (central computer) voice of the ship sounds disaster-ridden and asks everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there are only a handful of remaining people, including one of the ship's crewmen (Benny), the captain (Carrie) and the freight line manager (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turned out that the alarm clock was wrong and that the brain was behaving incorrectly. Passengers and other crew members must escape the ship <br /> <br /> Avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. Commercial opening is a very nice touch. There are obvious similarities to 2001: Odessa Space and the historical <br /> <br /> of the Titanic sinking. The movie sometimes slows and has problems in <br /> <br />, but in general is well-made and works well.
