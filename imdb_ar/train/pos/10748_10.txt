I must say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to reach ruin. I was the person who changed the station on the radio and the channel on the TV if there was any talk about the towers. I'm fed up with hearing that. When this was broadcast on television a year later and one day, I was fooling my eyes. This was the first time I had been crying since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I watch him on television now, five years later, and I still cry for the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only video clips of the first plane collides with the spectacular tower. It was an accident, and look at where I got it. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
