This is one of our wonderful "Our Gang" shorts. Spanky is in his nature and extremes, and the children who leave them to the babysitter are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky was forced by the gang to watch all their younger brothers. The opening shot of them all in strollers, and enjoying the various things hanging on the hands of the gang of fishing poles are a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Spanky wearing his huge knife when asked by an invaluable preschooler, as well as his response - "Hey, where do you get these things - I do not care about any kids!" The little fellow who says "gorgeous" in the film, all the beautiful gags, the huge news that tells the kids "All about Tarzan" are adding to make this one of our best "Gang" that you'll ever see.
