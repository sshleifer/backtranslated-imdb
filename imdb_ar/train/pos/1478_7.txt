I liked this film, although in the middle of it, I was able to find out who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if this film is based on a real story since it was told about "real" people at the end of the film. I think I'll have to look into it and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what happened? I think they moved to North Carolina if I was not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states can be changed to protect innocent people. <br /> <br /> You might think that this guy could have figured out it as easily as she did. Was he stupid or what?
