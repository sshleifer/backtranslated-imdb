After all the foolishness of Hollywood (and the Indian islands), we finally got a movie that offers some scary moments. There are some vulgar moments, but I'm not sure it's possible these days to make a full-fledged movie. There is not much new here ... it has been done well. <br /> <br /> Be sure to be careful, as "minute" concerns come quickly and frequently. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very good red hymn in this movie, and unfortunately, there is one very bad role. Chery Christian just does not make Julie effective (wife / mother). For one reason, they are not entirely sympathetic. I know, I know ... I've had a painful experience. But the viewer does not know her because she is "normal" and the relationship between her and her husband is somewhat uncomfortable (unintentionally). I think the director meant some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, the thumb of the end, which is both disturbing and sick. The price could have been cheap with a sound effect at the beginning of the final credits, but the director resisted wisely. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good old-fashioned scary movie style ... something rare nowadays.
