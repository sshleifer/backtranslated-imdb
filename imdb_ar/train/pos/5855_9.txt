If you play "Spider-Man" on a PS version, you'll see everything. To really experience it, you must get a DC copy. Simply put, it's a graphically superior game. The textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate, and she has a much better voice, then she is PS's cousin. I bought this game back in the late nineties and still exist to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a superior and strategic game, but if you're a fan of ol web head, you owe it to yourself to choose this for the gaming library. Swinging around town where Spidey did not show this well in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, surprise this at a cheap price. The DC version is simply incredible.
