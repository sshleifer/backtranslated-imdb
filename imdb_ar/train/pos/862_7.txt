Carla is essentially a deaf secretary without her hearing aid. When she finds herself burdened at work, she is able to employ Paul to help her out. Paul is out of prison, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say a lot about the story, which contains many transformations, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this film to me is how the sound is used to signal when Carla can hear and when not - a type of "hearing point" (such as a view). Early scenes of this, along with the evolution of Carla and Paul's early personality, were more interesting to me than the later transitions and transformations, which were difficult to follow and / or have little credibility. There are also some unpleasant acts of violence. Back to the positive side, the cinema was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching, but may not seek to find it. Recorded at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
