Did not know what to expect from a partner / friend / coach Van Damme / and choreographer for most of his films. It was good to see him acting "TONG PO" in the "Kickboxer and Van Damme movies." Now he is alone, he and his wife are making a great team.In this one Qissi is the director of the movement and leads the bad guy who is good, really mean, his wife was a writer, The scenes did not require work, they did a good job editing the film, they did a good job together, the story was logical, the fighting scenes were well edited, the shows were real fight and looked good together - the story came well, and if you can believe it ... There is no bad language, or sex, or just work.
