13 days to Glory tells the traditional tale in sympathy with the Mexican view. The main problem in this film was that while actor James Arnes played Jim Bowie in a convincing way, the other actors in the actors Brian Keith (Davey Crockett) and Lauren Green (Sam Houston) were too big. > <br /> Raul Julia played the role of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana with grace and dignity due to the professional soldier who won the battle. The scene in which his officers promote their failure to put a guard and prevent the prevention of any orders is a scene not understood by the scriptwriter. Failure to control is important in the military. Santa Ana was within his powers to be angry. Raul Julia had a surprisingly bad writing across the scene. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susanna Dickinson, a woman worth remembering for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have been reminded that when Dickinson is from Pennsylvania, the sound of Sutheron may not sound very strong.
