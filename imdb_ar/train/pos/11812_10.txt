These films are the best film to see in picture books. The costumes and color collections are quite vivid exactly as they are just like entering a comic book. This is the movie I think about when mobs are mentioned, suits, hats and positions. <br /> <br /> Hoffman has been a mocking relief as Mombel and you can only feel sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails to win the trophy. This film contains all the classic demagogic clich√©s - burying people in concrete, blowing up people's cars, tying up a good man and trying to blow up the house of his friends. <br /> <br /> This movie is classic in every sense of the word, so the camera angels are screaming comic book. It's great to be able to go back to an old movie and see that someone knew how to turn a movie into a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! You have to see this movie !!!!
