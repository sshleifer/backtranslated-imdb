The real measure of any imaginative work is whether the characters grow from their experiences or not, and emerge from the experience that has been changed in an important way (note that this change does not need to be positive or useful) in the end. <br /> <br /> By this measure, the enchanted April is a resounding success. As a sponsor in general, it succeeds in forming a wonderful and excellent band, sophisticated personalities interested in it, wonderful text and beautiful collections and sites. In short, the film is enchanting. Although all the presentations are top notch, three must be mentioned: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Blright. She says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual good work, but many others overcame her. Highly recommended, especially if you are romantic at heart. More repentant says no.
