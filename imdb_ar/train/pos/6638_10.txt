The attraction of old movies like this movie is that you can see an impressive picture of life more than 100 years ago. Here many people leave the factory, and all of them have died so far, and none of them are aware of the size of the invention they are walking before. I was shocked to read one of the reviewers who read this film as tedious as today's home videos, and at least one other person mistakenly identified it as the first film to be produced (the first film was produced at 16 frames per second instead of normal 46 shots Per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see is that a lot of people are coming out of a building and passing in front of the cinematographer on their way home from work, but this is a curiosity for several dozen, not least of which is that it was the first film produced Brothers Lumi√®re, who probably had a stronger influence on the development of cinema than any individual or group of other individuals in history.
