Well, first of all, I got this movie as a gift for Christmas so it was free! First, this three-dimensional film was supposed to be stereotyped. It's mostly, but whenever she's the main character in her car, the movie falls in two-dimensional mode! What!!?!?! It's not hard to shoot a movie in a car !!! Second - the story is not very good. There are a lot of wrong things in it. <br /> <br /> III. WHY SHOW ALL DEATHS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE! I make the movie suck when some kill !!! Watch it for good laugh, but do not waste your time buying it. Just download it or something cheap.
