Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, is performing martial arts in the pesky kicks in this stunning film in Hong Kong and proves that like her late brother Brandon is a real slice out of the old block. There is a high-tech trick to die for in this quick click, and Bond filmmakers should give it a look if they want to stimulate the thrill of the upcoming 007 adventure, where there are plenty of innovative things here with some fresh and innovative stuff. The original second module to promote the already high content is "AND NOW, YOU'RE DEAD". When you watch a fast-paced, entertaining film, you begin to wonder how the cinema itself managed to survive before the creation of martial arts. I really think that movies in general and motion movies in particular were only setting the time so I made the kung fu films for the first time. Bruce Lee is the father of modern motion cinema, and his legal surviving children do not let the family name here. Although there are many exciting performances in this film, they are Shannon Lee, who will remember her with incredible performance such as Mandy the hitgirl supreme.Hell; you may come away from whistling its battles!
