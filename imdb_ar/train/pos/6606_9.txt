It's time for Hollywood to sit down and take notice! If the actors act nervously, all you have to do is get the animation that worked on this small marvel. The Renaissance is probably the first moving click to make you forget that you do not see human beings. Although the sound cast by the cast (Craig, McCormack, Price, etc.) is one of the best I have ever heard of, but until then the feelings of "cartoons" are irritating. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a live painting. Ironically, such a technical wizard makes you forget that this movie is very cool. The development of conspiracy and error are fantastic and the boxes of dialogue are clear. <br /> <br /> Plot: The disappearance of a senior employee in a giant company reveals a tale of deception and corruption with a cool-hearted hero on his head. You can not say much without giving it all away ... but while the film keeps you at the edge of your seat, the peak leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> You should see it ... even the "adults" who smiled at the "cartoons"
