Adolf Hitler's obsessed desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second series in a series of seven parts of the US Department of War's production as an educational tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during World War II. Hitler's plan was systematic and well-designed, beginning with the invasion of Eastern Europe, extending to the heart of Europe, and then moved to the "global island" consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last move would be to reach across the oceans to eventually invade the Americas and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, where the rest of the country fell under his evil retribution. Primary school children sang in praise, and young German boys were trained and received in military camps. In a march against Austria in 1938, followed by Hitler by annexing a strip of land on the border with Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sodettenland. In 1939, Hitler took over all of Czechoslovakia. Later this year, the world was stunned to learn that Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with its deadly enemy, Russia, a ploy to delay Hitler's military involvement on many fronts. Immediately thereafter, Germany invaded Poland, bringing the invasion of Hitler to the threshold of Russia. I treated her later. <br /> <br /> During this period, Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's intentions across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, a notorious declaration that says "peace in our time." It did not turn out that way. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to be learned in this installment, at least for me, was provided by small extracts from footage of a pro-German Hitler rally in the middle of "30." He was led by a German-American who took his seriousness directly from Place - Madison Square Garden!
