Operates one of the great scientific fiction works of all time, such as insightful and thought-provoking like the Blade Runner or even the Gilliam Brazil. Willis offers his best performance here, but he excels in an incredibly feverish house role that does not resemble anything he did before or after. So Stu is not out of her league here, though. The story is very layered and offers very much to think about. The climate scene is gorgeous, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and funny in their own way. A lot of dark humor is presented here. Great design for production and cinematography. In my top ten.
