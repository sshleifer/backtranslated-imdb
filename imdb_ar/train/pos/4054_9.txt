The first time I saw this film came back in the eighties of the last century as a small film. My dad actually scored off the TV. I must have watched more than 20 times, before the relatively recent release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was surprised by how much the dialogue changed. In the first version, which I still have on the VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, which includes Van Der Beek et al, is more comic. <br /> <br /> In other words, watching the original US version of Akira is similar to this one, before watching the remodeled version using Japanese literal translation. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that in any case, the story and quality of the animation is not diminished, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki aims to narrate a lighter or darker subject in his film .....
