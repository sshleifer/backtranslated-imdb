I have to really disagree with Guy-yardley-rees who (if he had seen the whole movie) would have seen some stunning Scottish scenes (some of the best shots ever taken in Skye) and found a movie with a difficult beginning that all really touched. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. Instead, it is a film that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can not tell how many "standard" movies I've carried - paying the same things over and over again. Seachd does not seem to be about it at all. It really seems that they are trying to make something more realistic and definitely more than any modern Scottish film. <br /> <br /> Well, so acting is not in a successful way. This is because actors seem real people. In fact, I thought the main roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes extraordinarily beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really has a second watch, because there are many threads that are becoming clearer the second time - which really feeds on the end. <br /> <br /> In general, the mix of music and (sometimes) stunning images, as well as a societal approach to the extraordinary and representative structure have turned Seachd into a completely distinctive feature and an unforgettable film. More of these please!
