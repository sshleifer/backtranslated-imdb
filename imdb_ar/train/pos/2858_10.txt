Bonanza had a wonderful team of wonderful actors. Loren Green, Bernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Jay Williams (as his cousin who was brought to several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast was chemistry, and they seemed to really love each other. This made many of their weakest stories work much better than they should. They also make many of their best stories in great Western drama. <br /> <br /> Like any show filmed on 30 episodes each season, there must be some weak stories. However, most of the time each episode has an interesting story, a type of conflict, and the decision does not usually include violence. While Bonanza was Western, the fighting game with firearms was not the main attraction. While I admire The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead or Alive; those performances usually ended with a shoot. The gun battles were the number of Westerners who had resolved each conflict. Bonanza was quite different in the search for peaceful solutions and harmony rather than murder. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Ponanza, there are some interesting events that are characterized by lots of battles. These episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought to replace him. Williams was playing his long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay for another year, so Williams was taken out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam's old friend. If Williams remains throughout the Bonanza period, one wonders how good the series is in the years after 1965, when Bernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, once Bernell Whitaker leaves the series, the stories focused more on comedy and hijinks the country. Whitaker has often played a big role in many episodes, leaving his absence a team vacancy. Joe Little always wanted to play the beautiful child, as he always wanted to play the role of the old boy with the golden heart. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, this left little room for any gunfights. <br /> <br /> They once hired a farm called Candy (David Canary), who became its fourth member of the cast, but Candy did not appear in any gun battle, barely more than an old version of Little Joe. For one or two years, they also had Ben receiving another lost cousin (Jimmy, played by Mitch Vogel Oblivion) ​​who was a teenager who usually had some problems with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently by adding a teenager, the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the book an opportunity to write episodes on adolescent problems, alcohol, delinquency, and so on. This type of vascular ring was common in the 1960s as a reaction to the media based on the anti-culture movement. Perhaps Dragnet is the most popular source of law and order, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. Many other programs have also tried to jump on the cart by doing television shows involving irresponsible teenagers who cause harm, corruption and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager to the staff has given Cartwrights more opportunities to show problem solving, but these episodes feel very fabricated and not very good overall. After the death of Dan Blocker, the series faltered for another year or so before being canceled. The last season was very bad. He appeared in Little Joe's film, which tracks his wife's killers. Most of the episodes were somewhat turbulent because Little Joe usually drank or remembered how much he loved his wife and how unfair she was. <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw the last episode of the series at all, and I wonder if they have ever officially concluded it. By last year, there was only Ben (Loren Green) actually living on Bonderosa, where Adam had moved away (and never even once once as a guest). The man who left Little Joe died after his wife (in a series) was killed by rookies. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best in this series. Once Adam left, he slowly dropped. Most offers before 1970 are also very good. By 1970, she was trying to chain hard to be hip and positionless, and lost much of her western flavor. Adding candy and a baby girl also weakened the overall quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the last nail. Bonanza may be the best Western series ever produced, and of the 465 episodes that have been produced, there are at least 100 of them in great Western drama! This is a very good record. Even the worst in Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.
