Despite the wonderful and amazing animations, this is probably one of the most uninspiring Disney movies I've seen, and I do not close Disney movies much. Spirit is a wild boar that is repeatedly seized, either by cavalry or Indians, and both try to "break it". The soul ends in forming an association with the Indian, and this in short is the story. Except for the beautiful animation of the horses, I or I was a five-year-old inspired by this film. Ironically, it bears the title "soul," where the soul is what the film can use a little more. An additional point was given to the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Brian Adams and Hans Zimmer. Although this movie has been rated G, it is likely that you will end up explaining the meaning of "breaking the horse" for your five-year-old son. I did. <br /> <br />
