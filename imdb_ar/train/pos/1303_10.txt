Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Jenger Baker have joined forces to play all their songs 35 years ago when they formed a trio called Cream. Those were the narcotic days in England and America, and these men were looking at her: they were all very slender and long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a mix of rock and blues and were, for the most part, good things. <br /> <br /> Well, these people are now 60 years old, and they can still sing and play at a high level because the DVD disc shows us. I was always familiar with Clapton, of course, who never came out of the limelight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, whom I had not seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Becker was very hard and he looked like a maniac at speed near death. Now looks healthy, playing in the form of a drum. Bruce looked a bit tough but his voice was wonderful, as he was ever good, and I am happy to hear about these old songs. This is just an excellent article and performance from men who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this offer for being low-level. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert looked very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was fantastic and was the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
