Let me clarify one thing? Most often, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly amazes me more generally and more specifically with regard to the treatment of iconic figures loved by pages of comic books. why? Well, let's take a social scenario for the Hollywood Executive Board to clarify are we? <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Good point, let's make one rush after that! ?? We'll do good luck in a hat and choose a hero to randomly set up a movie on it! (The retreat takes place and the name of the famous superheroes is withdrawn) <br /> <br /> Executive No.1 'Great! Now who can play the role? <br /> <br /> "Who is the big box office star right now?" <br /> <br /> The name of CEO # 1 * for the big actor * is the special thing this week. ' <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'But does the role really fit? I mean it does not look personal at all. <br /> <br /> "Who cares? It's a big name; we'll make the movie with him anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive no.2" You're absolutely right! Besides, we will fill the entire film so that we can fill in the attractive special effects to appease the Moorish masses that nobody will ever doubt! <br /> <br /> The scenario above clearly illustrates one of the reasons why I generally dislike most modern superhero movies. All elegance, does not contain any other pathetic material from creative customers. Of course to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood gets properly ?? Take the original casting (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X Min films. <br /> <br /> But to go back to the negative public features introduced by Hollywood today ?? Executives have always been selecting actors that actually fit roles? Well in this less idealized world, a filmmaker believes it or not, by choosing actors based on their true resemblance to their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Colora. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to take out a full-length movie but fortunately for us, we have given us an amazing glimpse of the final result that is likely to look in the form of two (yet) famous super hero short features. One is the wonderful Batman movie: Dead End and the other is this fictional section of a fictional film called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not waste our words here? These are absolutely fantastic things! <br /> <br /> The selection of the winner Universe and the male model Michael O'Hearn (who looked just as great but was completely wasted in the dull barbarism) makes the most ideal choice for playing a creative man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical similarity, there is no doubt that there was no closer approximation to the comic character. <br /> <br /> Clark Bartram has been added back from his wonderful portrayal as a Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, there is another very wise piece of casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If this was indeed a real movie full length! Hollywood studio executives? Take note! This is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a last note, I am once again intrigued by the extremely divided reactions raised by this short film of fans. It is clear that the more severe and more severe negative reactions against it clearly come again (as with Batman: Dead End) than a younger audience and less cinematic experience; the fact of betrayal by the rudeness is rather rudimentary and the liberal use of the basic rules. Such an unfortunate situation of the closed horizon is indeed a sad phenomenon, although those possessed by the former studio executives mentioned in Hollywood, are very satisfied. After all, these misguided individuals are mostly the same type of CGI addicts who are addicted to the popcorn stuffing that appears in the majority of the waste that Hollywood raises these days.
