This film needs to be seen. The true picture of what is happening in the world that I have seen since Darwin's nightmare. Go see it! If you're lucky enough to open it in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of the DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas, although it is hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the actors are very good. It's inspiring that John Kozak has made this film, and I think he used to use some of his own money to do it. It's a silly land trip, obviously made without the resources you need, but it still works. John Stuart, Steven Colbert, SNL, and even Bill Maher did not show the courage to say what the film says
