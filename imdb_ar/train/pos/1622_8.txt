I saw this cartoon for the first time and got to know the cartoons of the famous black artists ... Cap Callaway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Becker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Tomas "Fatts" and Bill, Bill "Bogangels" Robinson, Stephen Fetchate Though) Louis Armstrong and the chorus girls outside the famous Cotton Club in Harlem. True ... stereotypes exist, but that was what they used to be ... These cartoons served as entertainment for adults in your local cinema before the main feature. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising's cartoons tend to be "attractive" and more upscale (after all, we're talking about MGM) from the short standard animation done at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or Columbia is modest. Even Mickey Mouse, who was very early in Disney, had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it before moving on to Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney had some cartoon cartoons of black artists as well ... for example, 1937's silly Woodland Cafe symphony. But we must remember that these films are part of a specific time and place. 50 years from now ... Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be screened, analyzed ... and even distorted by future viewers.
