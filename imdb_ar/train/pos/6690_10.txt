Mystery Men is one of those movies that you get entertained over time. There is a naive and "nice" innocence of the characters. It has become a part of our family "culture" and we move from the characters very much. It's my favorite film in the past two years. My children are 13 and 11, and we all love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monte Python clicks too. Well, we're not talking about the educated here, but about family ties only!
