This is a movie that gets better each time you see it. It is filled with many original and non-traditional ideas so that you will always find new details. As in the subsequent Sabo films (I have not seen "The Lucky Monkey" so far, but the other films are great), failure, opportunity and humanity play wonderful roles. The pieces and montage are innovative and artistic, without being a "technical" picture, but a very entertaining picture. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run", you have to bear in mind that "Dangan Ranna" was produced several years ago and was shown on German television in early 1997 ... so it is likely to inspire film Tom Ticor, not the other way around. Complementary to other reviews I have to add that I love acting and ending a lot. This film is very enjoyable in many ways, and it is able to deliver a message without disturbing or claiming.
