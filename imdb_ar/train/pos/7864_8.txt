This is the film "Madhur Bhandarkar". I'm not sure why he has this obsession to show child concepts and moles to a deceptive Indian audience, but I find some of these scenes really disgusting! what's new? It is a beautiful piece prepared by Bhandarkar, featuring the story of an entertainment reporter played by a leading lady in the famous film, Mr. and Mrs. Ayer. What makes this film different is that it also covers the stories of the people this reporter is interacting with or friends with, such as her roommates, colleagues, movie stars, models, the rich, and others on the Entertainment page # 3 in her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Note: It is another good performance from Ms. Ayer. It is likely to be noticed for this role. It plays selective roles but shines in them. It is remarkably unattractive and less beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment reporters are not supposed to outweigh the people who cover them, right? Referee: Madhur presented another good film, bringing social issues into the spotlight very well. However, this film loses focus and no one knows what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to explain to us the charm and wealth of the rich? Or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasts with the life of a real crime reporter? Are you trying to tell us how to govern the rich and the press? Or is it trying to explain problems related to child and national abuse. Other concepts include the unwritten rule that young women have to make with participating actors or stars if they want to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> In addition, he talks about how flight assistants get tired and tired. Of their jobs after a period of time and resort to extreme measures through the marriage of older people, etc. He also talks about the unfortunate women and the spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> That was all right for me .. but maybe be too complicated for ordinary filmgoers, who just wanted to relieve some of the stress of daily work
