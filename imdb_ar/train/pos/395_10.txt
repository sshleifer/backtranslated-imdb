This amazing and amazing film of oriental philosophy is presented by director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films in Hong Kong. The special effects are beautiful and fantastical. This plot is a little on the cerebral side, but a refreshing change from the films that treat its audience as if they were mad. If you are not thinking about your interest, it may not be your film. You may have to go to see the latest version of the "no studio" in Hollywood studios, but if you're looking for something else, you'll find it.
