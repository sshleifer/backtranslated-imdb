This film is as wonderful as we have often heard, it is in fact very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, I do not see clearly that it is a bleak or negative Austria or dismantled as an early fascist society. Quite the contrary: while there are already some very heavy scenes in the HUNDSTAGE and some characters must be called very bad people, at the same time you see love, beauty and humor in the movie Ulrich Siddles. This is exactly what makes HundSTAGE different from other films that try to show the lives of "ordinary people" in an intense and realistic way; their hustle, desire, and dark side: Sidel does not try to prove that working class life is wasteful! In my opinion, it seems that viewers who came to this conclusion are very afraid of recognizing that almost anyone's life is "clean" and "normal" as we would like others to think. And that each neighborhood has its dark sides and often depressed. The most beautiful scene: the old man from Vienna, watching his old girl dancing "in the eastern way," as he calls it. I think everyone finds this scene ugly and lacks a sense of beauty and has to ask itself what it is. These fascists: the characters in HUNDSTAGE or the spectators, extinguished by the body of a woman over 70 years old, dancing with all her charm to her lover.
