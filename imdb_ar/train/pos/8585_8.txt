Engage, the story of the fixation of the captive US army that must prove his innocence to avoid the executioner. Paul Reeker evades friendly fire in an apparent attempt to convince a military court that he was already an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. A very mysterious mystery, eloquently guided by eminent actors, the constant momentum of the director Kulik, transformations and turns effective plot. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964, and was subsequently reinforced for this review with several actors "name" and some sequence of actions. Dilman, who is re-enacting his role, reinforces the role of a dubious defense lawyer, sometimes distracted by the personal plight of Reker's supportive wife, although somewhat remote, played by Vera Miles. When the front line is finished, there are Peter Graves for the prosecution, Norman Phil and Murray Hamilton in the supporting main roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of Paul Reeker's character is a balanced portrayal of a simple yet dedicated man whose habit of challenging the behavior of the back challenges the desperate conditions in which he is placed. Marvin is transformed entirely from detached indifference, to passionate design, and often gives a convincing and intense performance, which highlights this small drama. It is this performance that should bring the film to a platform where it occupies a place in the best courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> However, despite the apparent ambiguity, Sergeant Reeker still has a convincing exam, like a book you can not put down. Highly recommended.
