Simply, Oliver! Is one of the greatest musical plays of all time. It's full of unforgettable songs - "Food Glorious Food" and "Oliver!" And "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name a few - and memorable characters alike. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical compilation of the classic Charles Dickens novel and is very similar to Oliver Twist's own story, an ideal family movie. There are some scary moments - Oliver Reid's evil Bill Sykes is scary enough on his own - but overall, the film will produce children of all ages as well as adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which everyone is obviously familiar with now - revolves around a small orphan boy named Oliver and his life grows up in London. At first, he lives in the workplace with the rest of his fellow orphans, but after he dared to ask Mr Bumpel, the supervisor, he was sold to a family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of unfortunate incidents and a close haircut, he meets Artful Dodger - played beautifully by young Jack Wilde, who gives everything in his role - and through him, Fagin greedy (Ron Moody), who trains Young boys choose the pocket treasures that they hold for themselves. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed only in studios and on audio clips at Shepperton Film Studios, but this does not translate into a movie at all. The sets replicate perfectly Victorian London, as well as costumes worn by characters. Winner of multiple Oscar and huge success in its release, Oliver! Is a competition worthy of the best music at all times and will delight anyone who loves the film.
