"Opening Night", which was published in 1977, is trying to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character in the playwright Myrtle is not necessarily someone we love in real life. It is self-absorbed, often repugnant, and makes life miserable for those around it - in other words, no different from some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we are not quite sure that the demons you fight are real or imagined, even though we allowed early secrecy. It is clear that Rowlands is well directed with love by her talented husband, actor / director John Casavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is very long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle developed on stage while it seems very drunken drunk. The "improvisation" of some dialogue - at least during the theater - goes a long way. Some supporting characters perform well, especially from Ben Gazarra, where they play the role of Myrtle. Joan Blondell's character has never been fully developed, and I have never been able to find out why she was in the film, except to appease Myrtle. Watch this movie for Rolands alone - it's great all the time - and it's hard to close your eyes, though you'll want to do it sometimes.
