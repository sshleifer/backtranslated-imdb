There is no doubt that Halloween is one of the best films ever, not only in terms of its kind, but also abroad. I like movies with a creepy atmosphere like everything that can happen here, some kind of attitude makes it scary to think about. And also to imagine if you are in this case, what will you do. This is a movie that I enjoy watching very much, especially at the time of Halloween. John Carpenter is a very professional director and I love many of his other films, but his film is certainly the most famous film, Halloween.Oh, and if you think about watching the new version of Rob Zombie does not happen. It's pure nonsense and the real Valentine's Day fan really likes the 1978 version of John Carpenter. Michelle Myers is one of the finest homeless killers in any film, a well known one. So, check out this great masterpiece that you'll really like.
