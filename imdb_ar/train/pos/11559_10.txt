Strange couple is a comic jewel. One of the most widely used scripts in celluloid - just surpassed by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the two best friends: obsessive-compulsive disorder and dirty Felix, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife had already left him because it was impossible to live with him because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film, and after a failed suicide attempt, moves with an Oscar poker friend. This is when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is awesome and full of wonderful fonts. You may already be familiar with "F.U." A joke but still works brilliantly because of the comic timing of Matao. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemon tries to wipe the sinuses at dinner and when my bathroom sister is charmed by Matte Mato and Lemon completely out of his element. This one requires repeat views!
