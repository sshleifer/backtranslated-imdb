As if the film was not valuable in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel in preparation for reading it. In the summer of 1968 she watched the film in New York City. Which is located in the Graduate School, I first read the book. It was a pleasure to read the novel my memory of the film detailed accurately. For better or for worse - I have now read and studied the novel for more than three decades - still Milo Ochia Leopold Blum.
