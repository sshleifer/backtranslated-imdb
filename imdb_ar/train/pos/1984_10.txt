One of the finest musicals, one valid for all times and worth watching over and over again. Tasty! The acting, especially by Ron Moody in the role of Vagin, is wonderful. Fantastic costumes .... even those shabby. <br /> <br /> The two young players who play with Oliver and the Drivol Dodger have a great talent. Oliver Reed does a great job of portraying Bill Sykes to a place where you can only hope to reach an appalling end .... which he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is cleverly designed and captivating. Oliver can carry himself with the likes of My Fair Lady, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A film for the entire family.
