So I consider myself very big in the anime scene, with very few programs, I will not just watch it. <br /> <br /> This offer, however, I recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the most original series yet, it got everything I can order. A side story, so to speak, unconditional love will not be accepted, a very stark comedy, in addition to a wonderful voice representation (Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for her hilarious funny side, it would just be another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I noted, "I love or hate her," very few people I have seen have come to end this series with a discussion for her. <br /> <br /> Native to the core, with everything you can ask in the afternoon, bet on the house in this series. I am ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
