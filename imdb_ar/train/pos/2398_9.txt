I really enjoyed this movie. It took a rather dark story - the story of Shakespeare Macbeth - and it was produced in a fashionable, eccentric yarn that is often funny and touching. Scotland together under one roof. The conflicting worlds work. <br /> <br /> Truly the plot and comedy are raised in the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a choir, a part that is not in the play but really helps in jazz. above. The end emerges between the small islands of India that I saw because of the closeness and originality.
