35 years ago, Groove Tube seems a lot like the actual TV today! Specialized sports networks (nude sports), a television program about party drug dealers (ala Weeds, and even before Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke) of 1978, commercials, butz beer, no less than Bud Bowls, - A child clown from Koko (Pee Wee Herman), and even Chevy Chase have a sense of humor (a violent hairdresser) one year before he first appeared in 1975 on Saturday Night Live. Thanks to the infamous opening sequence that Groove Tube received on an initial X rating, I still can not hear "Move On Up" from Curtis Mayfield without thinking about hippies hikinghiking for bare dance ---------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------, Kentucky Fried, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python Beyond The Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and FireZine Theater everything you know is wrong.
