Romer returns to his historical plays in the real story of Grace Elliott, an English woman who stayed in France during the summit of the French Revolution. One of them always suspected that Romer was a conservative, but he knew he was a red blooded victim. If you can put Rohmer's defense aside from the property (which is not easy, given that, for example, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hateful), this is actually a smart and smart film. Due to the lack of funds for a major cinematic recreation in France in the 18th century, Rohmer instead played with actors against coated cardboard. It is a stark industrial cone, but it works in some way. Newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making her sympathetic personality do not have to be.
