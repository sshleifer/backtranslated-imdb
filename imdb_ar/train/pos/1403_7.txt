Paul Verhoeven (a genius and master filmmaker) returns to perfection, but he is still enjoying "a dirty old man," Hulu Man. The first two works are so good that the final spoiler act is disappointed. However, I recommend this film because it has special effects on MIND Blowing (probably the best yet) and two great performances by potential clients. Verhoeven's moral questions are undoubtedly thought-provoking, and although the film has turned off a lot, this film is an essential core of the old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> There are two main drawbacks: Josh Brolin (also known as Monkey Walking) the whole deal with the elevator. If there is an arrival ladder, why are they trapped in the laboratory? <br /> <br /> A horror film on Saturday night.
