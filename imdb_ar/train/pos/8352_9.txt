This film is an amazing piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewers that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors in the last 50 years. His performance stuns you, wakes me, disgusts you and keeps you moving while you are left tight. This film was filmed in the early days of his career as a raw film, but he is still able to deliver Depardieu mastery. It must be seen for any Depardieu lover and his best early works to a great extent.
