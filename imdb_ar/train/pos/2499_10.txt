This film was amazing. He had an original concept (that vampire film meets Yakuza mob film). It is a comic film, but it is very tragic about friendship, love, eternity, death, happiness and comments that give intelligence to society. By Gackt Camui, the role of Sho was rendered excellently, HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as a tormented but humorous vampire, Kei. She also laughed and cried at the lucky figure, Toshi, who grew up with Shaw. I loved every second of this film, especially moments like the funny cigarette scene and fighting scenes, and most of all, the hearty ending.
