I was five years old when I saw this musical while I was on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with her. After 27 years, remains a key inspiration for achieving my goals set for completion since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of "behind the scenes" in the entertainment industry during the late 1950s, "Sparkle" depicts the struggle of three young sisters seeking their place in the sun. This story can just become a biography of many aspiring young artists about what can happen when things seem to happen very quickly and role models are not available to lend a hand. <br /> <br /> The enormous music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries every song. From exposure to situations that leave almost no choice for long-term strong decisions, to the ultimate sacrifice to move forward, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different ways one can take them when you start to achieve your ideal opportunity as a contribution to the society. <br /> <br /> This film may have generated ideas for "Dreamgirls" in Broadway and Mariah Carey "Glitter" 25 years later. As an original member of both productions, I have seen many similarities in both stories with Sparkle, as well as in Saturday Night Fever, Fame, Flashdance and Off-Broadway Stash Mama, I want to sing.
