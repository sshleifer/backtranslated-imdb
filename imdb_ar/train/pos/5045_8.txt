The film is very full in what it is, while keeping one constantly interested with childhood memories and growing up with such an exotic father, interspersed with serial killing tails, one can simply go wrong. The plot itself, the story of the film and its essence, amusing. It's a kind of story that Bill Bexton can do a lot, and in that case, he did a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you still expect more and more about what's going on and where the movie goes, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film had been beautifully executed from start to finish, and one of those rare jewels that seemed without any dull lulls - the film flows accurately and quickly and narrowly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: so they do such terrible things to their loved ones, and do such evil deeds, in the name of "God" when they are disappointed as in this case. They are also sometimes interesting in their "transformations and in the sense of morality as a whole." <br /> <br /> In general, this is the type of film that one easily ignores, but I advise you not to do the same and check out this film - it's worth your time.
