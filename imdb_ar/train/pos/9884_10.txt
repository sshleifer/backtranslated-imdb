Rawhide was a great Western TV series. With a focus on the gang of the trail of controversy led by coach coach Jill Saleh. Most episodes - especially from the first three seasons - were personal studies of Favor and his men. The lost stars came and went, but unlike the Wagon train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rauheid was a real and brave Westerner, and Favour's generation emerged as a memorable and unforgettable figure. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show was a great success. Of course, he was ably supported by an impressive group of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Shib Woley, Paul Bringer, Steve Rynes, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Caball. All these actors left their mark on a piece of television history. Rawhide has taken on the flavor of that time from the West that no other series has been able to achieve for me, anyway, so far. Subsequent chapters tend to split leads and give them individual story lines. For me some time this did not work - the cattle campaign and the rules of order provided the best stories. However, there are still some classic stories and Rawhide remained at the top of the drawers. Black and white photography added to a bleak and realistic feeling that other Western soap operas rarely caught. Hunters, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful girls in distress, serial killers, all appeared to give our heroes problems. The end of the series came calmly when the last season was separated by less than half the way. The reason - Eric Fleming had left and now became Raohead without a body - the bold realism, and the command of Gill Favory, had lost respect and power - was never infallible and that made him more interesting. We will not see him again. Watching a ring whenever you can, I rarely disappoint.
