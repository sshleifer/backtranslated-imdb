I watched this movie on TV .. <br /> <br /> My father was lost when I was young and this movie did not touch me for sure .. <br /> <br /> I can feel lost I felt the little girl Desi .. < /> <br /> The feeling of wanting to see her father again .. <br /> <br /> The desire to talk to him .. <br /> <br /> Or at least given the opportunity to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> <br /> She says that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to answer her and buy her a gift because there is no store in paradise .. <br /> <br /> It just lets me feel that miracles are there ..
