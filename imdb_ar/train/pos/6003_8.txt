The dramatic heart of drama is the words that come to mind when I think of "secret games." It becomes more exciting as the film goes on sometime it blew me away! I did not expect the wonderful scene I was about to face. "Call Girl" has its first customer and what customers! One of the most exciting lesbian scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have listened to his wife and may not have gone on this exciting journey. It turned out to cost them in the end, but it was an exciting trip! Go to see this movie!
