Hitchcock felt that the masses were not really interested in exposing the heroes to danger - only that they were in danger and needed to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when it is not. Trevor Howard decides that the best course of action is to run for it. Thus, the film's body avoids our attractive partner inside and outside the trains, buses and coaches - jumping over rocks at the top of the waterfall - flowing through the roofs of the shipyard. <br /> <br /> All the exciting stunts - but I could not get out of my mind that everything was unnecessary. They should have remained in their position. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
