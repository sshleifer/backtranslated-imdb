From start to finish, I laughed hard throughout the film. It's amazing to be "The Groove Tube" is the grandpa, but the most fragile, among all the comedy movies play. This is how I enjoy watching TV without feeling bored by flipping in the channels just to suffer from insomnia! For 73 minutes, strange and strange humor never stop! Just think about how all this nonsense laugh can help you enjoy life easier! It's a better way than Comedy Central or any major time program! Do you prefer to destroy all those romantic and weak romantic comedy movies in the trash! Better yet, tell your box office manager that you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
