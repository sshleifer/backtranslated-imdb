Imagine putting out lights in the remote farmhouse on a cold night, then going to bed. There is no need to lock doors. The only sound is the whistling wind through the trees. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off the top inch of the driveway. Moments later, a thief lit a flashlight in the dark living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture very scary is the setting: a remote farm ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with similar B & W lighting to the best Noir films of 1940, In Cold Blood offers a terrifying story, especially in that first chapter, where the plot is largely performed at night and in a country where roads are drenched. They are nightmares. But this is not a dream. The events really happened, in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two men deceive with full-fledged heads are killing the entire Kansas family, looking for some amount of non-existent criticism. Richard Brooks used the actual locations where real life events took place, even the farm ... and inside it! He makes an unforgettable film, and a chase. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors is similar to the killers. Robert Blake is more persuasive than Perry Smith, short and full of Boom legs, dreaming of finding the treasure of Cortez buried. Scott Wilson is as good as Dick Hickock, the American smile-smelling fool. <br /> <br /> After the wave of murder, the duo heads to Mexico. Things go on, so they go back to the United States, steal cars, walk on foot, and are usually miserable as they roam from place to place. But it is a foolish life, and the outlaws soon regret their actions. The last 20 minutes of the film are dazzling, as the rain falls, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the beating of the beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with his mundane action, "cold blood" stages in the details fix a realistic story that still lingers, after nearly half a century. This is the setup that does it. Do you assume that people in rural Kansas are still leaving their doors locked ... at night?
