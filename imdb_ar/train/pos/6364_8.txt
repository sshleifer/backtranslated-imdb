"Atlantis: Lost Empire" was all that previews indicated it would be. You do not often find it. Most often, previews show only the best parts, then the rest of the movie is awesome. Not so with this one. I was pleased with the original plot, although the sub plots were not. Animation was not hacked like "partner" but it was good, but less. The plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow points in it. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You'll also think a bit, but not much. Once you think about it a bit, you can figure out what should happen but you do not know for sure how it will happen. <br /> <br /> The choice was also good. Michael J. Fox, where Milo was an excellent choice. His character fits well. The well-known commanding leader Rourke was also chosen with James Garner. My character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I also liked. I really liked casting Christian Claudia like Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a meaningless character makes the film more interesting. It's very bad, it's evil. <br /> <br /> On the whole, you are definitely worth (8 out of 10).
