Everyone has the first love, and although it is difficult to identify this feeling when you are younger, there is a pain inside you. This is what Malaysian filmmaker Yasmine Ahmed aims to prove in her fourth film, where the most complex emotions are listed in a simple and misleading way. <br /> <br /> Such an approach is particularly appropriate in this case, as the love story at the heart of the film involves two twelve-year-olds, thus making any attempts at "deeper" analysis appear contradictory and patriotic. They also do not represent a testimony to the stunning performance of the most ineffective actors, Sharifa Ariana and Mohammed Sayyaf Naseeb. The first play, Orchid (which she had previously considered as an adult in the image of the former Ahmed, Jabra), is an almost energetic girl who was probably influenced by her "British" education (her mother studied in England), playing with toys, . Then one day she met Naswip, who had come for holidays at his aunt's house, and suddenly changed her habits: farewell battles, bike ride hi and climbing trees. But what does this mean? Are they just friends, or is it something more tacit, none of them yet ready to understand, let alone accept? <br /> <br /> Given the young age of the novel, the answer to these questions is impossible, and so, as in many "smaller" films (comes to mind), there is no real closure, Bittersweet, but ultimately tastes great: the uncooked natural taste (especially Ariana) appears almost immediately, and the strong support crew (the Orked family more than anything else) helps to keep narrative pleasure to a minimum and seduction. The ground-based approach is not always effective (the playful sub-plot about the adulterous neighbor is dropped too early), and it is difficult to justify the reference of the fantastical fantasy at the beginning of the feature, but the emotional power of teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of Asian cinema Independent.
