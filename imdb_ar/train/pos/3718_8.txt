This movie was good. You do not have a typical war flick but something a little different. This film showed us recruits in prewar training and not actually going to war. This film is one of the most realistic views about war and the army of most other films like this product. Colin Farrell did a great job filming an army recruiter and Clifton Collins Junior and Matthew Davies contributed well. Colin Farrel's vision moves from row b to row in a few short years, you will not think about it. I will also add that the Tigerland makers did a fantastic job filming a movie in 2000 and making it look like the 1970's had a good touch. It's good to see talent used wisely and I hope to see this same talent again in the near future.
