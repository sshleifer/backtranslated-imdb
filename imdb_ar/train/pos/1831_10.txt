This film was rather shocking, and the last film for Vipul Shah was good and this was bad although it was a good story and was treated superbly. Aatish Kapadia who wrote this film from another Gujarati play "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" made a good song but It's a slow two and a half hours to see there are a lot of flaws in this film, but the entertainment songs are still working and not working well but they are still good in general, not a movie you'll see with enthusiasm, it's still a story to take into consideration, The good kind of movie relationship with a lot of flaws and humor and this really is not a pilgrim Even one bit
