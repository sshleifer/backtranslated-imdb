For all the murder addicts there, this movie was great! Every character has ever appeared in the film. It has helped resolve some (but not all) of the problems. Unfortunately, unless you actually see the show, you'll miss most of the fun, with the movie showing strong signs for every season of the show. This may be appropriate as a background for the series rather than a separate film, but we will take what we can get. I hope they will make more films and continue to show the killers of law and order.
