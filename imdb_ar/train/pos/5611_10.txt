I saw this movie at a time when I was shy with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that's why I took it seriously. I completely believed in the psychological deterioration of the bad character within Paris for permanent building sites, dust, crushing, selfishness, rudeness, slander and corruption. I give all the credit to Polanski's art towards him, his play and his inevitable text, but I was fainted in the terrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the director's office. Luckily for me, my life has not been so singularly disastrous (so far), but I have always been very respectful for an artist who can perform such illusions and completely indulge in reality (fake) trying to convey. Simply put, a man is a genius of first class and a credit in the human race. This film is the sum of many great acting and casting situations. Since some of the performances were conducted in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters, Mlyn Douglas and others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski dubbed him in English and French, I warmly recommend, if you come across two languages, to convert the sound from French to English and vice versa , During the appropriate scenes while watching the wonderful transport on the Paramount DVD. This film is part of the so-called "Triplex of Residential Buildings" in Polanski, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, the movie "Repulsion" has not been converted to DVD transfer in Region 1. It goes without saying that the three films will achieve a great selection of movies.
