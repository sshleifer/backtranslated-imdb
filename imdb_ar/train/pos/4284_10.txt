This film is one of the most exciting, sadest and most accurate images of a mentality that seems to have spread in the Balkans once again, 45 years after the time it was filmed. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with this anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing will be the most appropriate response.

In fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should try anything to watch this film, and his twins * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Did you mention that it was one of the most watched films ever?
