There are many new styles in the sitcom but the method that works best is the old way with an audience and an internal set. This 70 show is a great example. When the show was on the air, no one really heard of Courtwood Smith and Debra Joe Robb, much less than the teenagers who had played brilliantly by Tupier Grace and Ashton Cochton (both leaving this year's show to follow other interests). I hope Tubheer stays in the place because the show started around his character, Eric, and his circle of close friends. Ashton is already John Travolta in our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Highland of Eight Is Enough, thought of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast was not known to us, which is good because a member of the celebrity team may spoil it. I miss Mo Jaffney who played Joan with his girlfriend. I miss Lisa Robben Kelly as her original Laurie, the substitute could not replace her and I'm sorry about that. I liked casting Tommy Chung's lost but beloved figure of Stephen Hyde. I loved watching Tania Roberts alongside Charlie's Angels. I loved the role of Brooke Shields in Jackie's role. She has really shown her acting talent before going to Broadway. This offer was a delight with many surprises. I hope this offer goes on for a longer time despite the departure of two team members but I hope they do not stay too far away. I hope the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, The Third Rock of the Sun, were more successful on Fox than they did on NBC that ruined their show. Turner is not a puppet and I hope they will create more such shows in the future.
