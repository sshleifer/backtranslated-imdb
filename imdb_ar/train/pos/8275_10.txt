Wendigo is a good thriller film myself, the film contains some wonderful drama between characters and some good crawling scenes. Representation is good, characters act like ordinary family. Deer Form reminded me of Wendigo's little influences from Rabbit's Darko. <br /> <br /> The movie sees that a family will remain in the house for a while, but a group of deer offered by the hunters arrives and one of the fishermen named Otis starts arguing with George, after the car is lifted and they drive out to the house. Son Miles is a little upset by the deer, but parents try to tell him that things like this happen naturally. On that night while he was in bed, he began to see strange things in the bedroom, and the next day they went to the city and Miles met a man on the counter giving him a small statue of Lindeo, when Miles Kim showed up on the statue and told her that a man from the counter had given him a landlord . As soon as he got home, George took his son to ski. While on the way, Miles got out of the board and the miles chased the wind. After they got the precision they were looking for, they found him outside the house telling them he had been shot. Kim Sheriff's Hospital told Otis that he had shot him, as Sharif went to Otis where he was hit by a hammer, while Otis was on the road and found Windego behind him. <br /> <br /> Wendigo is a very good movie that contains some chilling moments. Check this out. 10/10
