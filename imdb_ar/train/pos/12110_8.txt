For those who believe that the anime revolves around the giant reptiles that are raping the pupils, think again. There is a completely different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those offers. It's a sweet tale for a little boy with a gift to make delicious bread. His world revolves around making Japanese bread that can fit into the famous European bread. The show is eccentric when they come and I'm sure non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. But it is still very good to watch it because of its innocent appearance full of display. <br /> <br /> In the Yakitate World! It is not uncommon for people to appear to have received orgasm after eating bread. Bread is hallucinatory and can give the consumer a wide range of great powers, from time travel to swimming like fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funny programs I've seen in a while.
