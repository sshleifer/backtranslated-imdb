Ah, Noir. My favorite type. Otto Breminger's follow-up to Laura is Noar's New York postwar film, where corruption and violence are rampant. Starring Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dickson, an investigator whose brutal methods put him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a suspect in a murder, Dickson tries to blame the head of the crime, Tommy Scales. Dickson is about to achieve his goal when he gets involved with the dead man's wife, Morgan Taylor. Of course, in a traditional Noir way, things are going quickly down the hill. <br /> <br /> While the film does nothing interesting or wise, it has a steady tone of awe and depression. Like most great sounds, it is also a great pace, as the viewer is initially absorbed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> However, like most premering movies, it's something I do not see again. It lacks verbal intelligence for Wilder, or the optical thumb of hitchcock or spatial experimentation of the welsh. Like Lang's subsequent work, "The Pier" feels like a "clone" of what Nuer should be, rather than something really technically true. <br /> <br /> Objectively the film is not something special. It is about a policeman who finds himself a criminal slowly. Dixon explains in one scene that his father himself was a small villain. The film blends with the concept of predestination, but this scene is as much as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The action of the camera is equally disappointing. There is no intelligence in the Otto camera. No effort was made to set the camera to anything. Do not play with space, architecture or empahsise procedural step by step police. It's just a tripod set ups with Dolly sometimes inside and outside. Meaningless, although most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> However, there is one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (the Nuer Cage) that enters itself in a transport cart (another crate) and is transported to the head of the gangs cache. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto replays the movie, and it's like "Downstairs" to hell. This works fine, but the design fails to set it up. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems satisfied with following the Hawksian template about what is Noir, rather than playing with potential where he can go. Such as Detour, Night in the City, Scarlet Street, In Lonely Place, Act of Violence, Bomberang, Johnny Eger, Where End the End, Side Ends "is one of those well-made noirs class II film. It is efficient and attractive, but lacks additional magic.
