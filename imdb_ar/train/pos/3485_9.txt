This WrestleMania just did not do it for me. While some things, such as the royal battle and celebrity engagement, were a rebound of the old days, so to speak, it seemed more than just "in your home" than anything else. Above average ... worth it for many matches like matching the tag team title, although it's worth noting that changing the title means nothing, as it was reversed the next night.
