The movie only enters Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, after many illegal DVDs found their way into the public. It is clear that the popularity of illegal DVD leads to its introduction in theaters, with the public still appearing. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture to your home in a wonderful way. Sometimes in a comic way, the story is told about a playwright writing a story about his theater, because the ordinary Kabuki theater is boring. <br /> <br /> At first, the audience may be a bit confused about the story we follow, but when the story unfolds, we see that love between a male and a demon leads to a wonderful story about a new Kabuki play. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark if this story is supposed to have already occurred in Japanese traditions and legends, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with love of the theater, expression, bright colors, humor and tragedy makes this trip a fascinating journey on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema as well as the theater. <br /> <br /> Allow yourself to leave completely when watching this movie, try to see it in the cinema instead of the TV at home. <br /> <br /> Even so, there is a critical point: the sound is sometimes a little annoying. Although most of them are great music, there are only a few moments in the film I think they had to choose some of the most dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor has made the director choose even lighter moments in the music.
