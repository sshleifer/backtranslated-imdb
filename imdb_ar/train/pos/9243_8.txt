Do not listen to many sarcastic and sarcastic comments on this film ..... Simply, for ninja movies, my friends are as good as they get! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes the representation and the text are very terrible, but through the gums - it's a lot of bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the terrible "acting" (which in the case of the film in question is really among the worst I've ever had!) And the absurd plot actually only increases the enjoyment of ten times. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the scenes of fighting are the main attraction in this, and for the most part, I am happy to say, they are very well designed, especially the final confrontation (where we see that the ninja is not ostensibly constrained under the laws of gravity Normal ....) <br /> <br /> Trust me in this, if you love ninja movies and have not yet seen Sakura killers, then you really miss what is in my opinion, one of the real gems in the genre crown.
