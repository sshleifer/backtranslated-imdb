Unlike the delivery of Susan Hayward's wood throughout this film, it was as good as any biblical film made. Henry King deals with this respectful epic film in all the small scenes, Beck, as always, impeccable. Alfred Newman's dramatic sound, with Psalm XXIII unforgettable even after these many years. The scene with Goliath is a little on the hokey side, but not all that happened badly for the era in which this film was made. This goes well along with the epic of the Bible less than today, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It is worth watching, and Raymond Massey is as excellent as Prophet Nathan. The film was rounded up by James Robertson Justice, who was always Abechy and Jane Meadows in the role of Michelle, David's first distant wife.
