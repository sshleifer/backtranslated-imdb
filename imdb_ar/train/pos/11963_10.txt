"Scoop" is the most easily extinct film by Woody Allen for the year 2000 to date. Alan, although he is finally looking at his age, is at the forefront of his low-cost witch Sydney Waterman. His one hardcore and behavior are hilarious. Do not let critics control your opinion. "Scoop" is a top notch "Woody Light" image. <br /> <br /> Classical music is an excellent compliment to the work on the screen. Scarlett Johansson looks great in this swimsuit. Jackman is broken. Glow film. Scoop is a wonderful lifesaver from start to finish. The last shot of the film alone deserves the admission price.
