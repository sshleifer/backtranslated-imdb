I must admit, I did not expect much from watching this film in my film Japenese, but this film really blew me up. The director does a great job following the title of his film, where he really depicts a picture of madness. I think the fact that this silent film adds to the resemblance of madness, which helps the viewer experience the world's inner characters instead of the world outside his mind. This film has just added to my feelings about foreign silent films versus the American, where foreign films do much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than go to a thin film always with happy ending, with very little imagination practice.
