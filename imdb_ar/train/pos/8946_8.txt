This impossible story is for a witch who follows a mortal man in a mortal world. Its "community" is open among its members, but it hides its charm from human beings. Hmmm ... This seems to be familiar. Haha. It's not your usual movie. The "camp" offers made by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from being boring. Kim Novak is always pleased to appear on the screen, but I found that her association with James Stewart is unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> With new attention to the dark and dark things, this movie deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by the old and new fans ... it's a great experience!
