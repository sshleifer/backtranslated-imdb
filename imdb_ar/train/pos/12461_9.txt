A smart script by SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and the smart shows of two men - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should be the other way around) produces an attractive and entertaining sensation. <br /> <br /> In addition to veteran Jean Herman's trend and the intermittent and effective result of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy to enjoy the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> This is the story of my friend or friend. Whether they are disappointed or tired of the world, they are returning from Algeria. Like other colonial powers at this time (post-World War II to the 1960s), France struggled to maintain external appearances. Algeria's loss was a severe blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) lists the actions of our heroes (the opponents) because they are struggling to get out of them after they leave. <br /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer must really notice, because JAPRISOT is thrilled and economical in writing: If there is, there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that these two men are physically and psychologically engaged on a long weekend. Their motives are quite different, and their goals are different - their survival depends on one another. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are completely different from the outside - first, it can be said that he is a beautiful boy, and the last is an ugly butcher, adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> This endeavor makes a great story, which in turn makes a great movie. <br /> <br /> Lest there be women in this film, and according to the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, although they do almost; to say much more is to spoil pleasure in discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, his friend was released in the UK; distorted image, improved 16.9; English only (not even translations for the hearing impaired); runtime of 110 minutes; MONO SOUNDTRACK but DE ROUBAIX music has a lot of Problems! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
