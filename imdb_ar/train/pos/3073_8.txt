This is the type of film that Hollywood needs to achieve more of it. No extravagant props, no car chases, no sharp one smart. Only people who deal with people. <br /> <br /> William Messi plays a potential killer who works with his father, Donald Sutherland. Messi is the obedient son, Sutherland is the autocratic father. The son wants to get out of work, the father will not allow him. Messi loves his son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> It is an interesting group of characters and follows the deadly film AC He balances his character needs with that family. There are many moving scenes, especially between Messi and his little son. As you would expect in a film with William Messi in it, there is a kind of humor as well. <br /> <br /> Excellent work everywhere, actors and directors. It's good to know that they can still make a good Hollywood movie with a small budget.
