I remember seeing this film as a child. I do not remember where I saw him. I must be about 14 years old. I thought the film was amazing and I hope to see it again. It came on Kung Fu Channel once, but I missed it. I was really bothered. It's the best movie Kung Fu special effects I've seen so far! I highly recommend it and now that I've discovered a place to get it, I can enjoy it again for years to come. I must also check out the film "The Return of the Poison," which some have talked about very strongly.
