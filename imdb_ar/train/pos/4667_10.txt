I recently found this film on VHS after I searched for it for several years, and I was not disappointed. It improves every time I see it. Peter Ostinov wrote and co-wrote the original script (nominated for the Oscars). Other stars include Carl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Austenov plays an accountant / fugitive, has just been released from the famous Wormwood Scrubs prison in England (he was embezzled from Conservative Party headquarters, chosen because he is a liberal). He immediately starts looking for a new employer who can embezzle him, and discover that computers are the wave of the future. He is a social engineer on his way to a men's club in London, identifying the best computer experts in the city and stealing the identity of one of Caesar Smith, who just left for South America to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. He talks to Ta-Can-Co, an American company headed by Carlton Clipper (Karl Malden). Klemper rents Smith and shows him around the center of the computer, especially the security feature of flashing blue light. Ostinov asks the computer about how to defeat his security and tells him to compel the computer to "unplug the blue light." Using 30 years of hacking techniques in the future, Ustinov is breaking into the system and computer software to create written checks for multiple fake companies. The chart begins to collapse when assistant Klemper Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notes the amount of work that Ta-Can-Co seems to deal with Ustinov fraudsters. With the help of his secretary Batty Troweliger (Maggie Smith), Ostinov managed to avoid prosecution and live happily ever after. To tell you how you will spoil this funny picture, romantic, intelligent and innovative.
