I saw this after many years of the TV series, and at first, I did not care about it. Then, when my memory fell into the chain over time, I saw it again, and found it completely joyful. Based on the play by Neil Simon, it has not been "opened" much on the big screen, and this is one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are both outstanding at Oscar and Felix, and the cast is excellent, especially John Wilder as Finney. So far, certain moments can reduce me to tears - Felix interrupts Oscar in the middle of the ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking and chasing Felix around the apartment, the "Pigeon Sisters" stirred up by the stories of Felix and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene ( By Nora Ephron in "When Harry Met Sally"). Sharp shaving dialogue also. When the boys think that Felix has an overdose, Oscar says, "They can be vitamins! It could be healthier in the room!" Wonderful!
