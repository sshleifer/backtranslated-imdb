Old Mill Pond is a tribute to African American artists in the 1930s more than any distortion of the entire sex (despite the cartoons of Stepin Fetchit). Besides that I have just mentioned, there are also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. These Happy Harmonies from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising are very musically entertaining with perfect descriptions everywhere. They all seem to resemble the real thing that half of them think they are likely to be. If not, it is certainly very impersonating. Even the slow lazy Fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when a tiger chases him while "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Highly recommended for lovers of animation and jazz in the thirties.
