Richard Willaims is the god of animation. The product was disabled in the output of this movie. The final product is a very uneven film with a very crooked story, but some amazing moments of animation (like "greedy" Emery Hawkins). Frequent music Joe Raboso does not help either. It is made on a widescreen screen so that VHS does not show it with all its glory, so let's hope to create a DVD written in letters one day. It is still worth watching for some eye-popping animation.
