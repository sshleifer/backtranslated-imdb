It's not a great movie as many people think (including my late aunt, who said it was her favorite film). But because of the best passages in this Noir film, especially that the "Fun House" finale is famous, the lady of Shanghai gained a place of importance beyond its true value as a key to the smooth failure of Orson Welles in overcoming Hollywood. <br /> <br /> By 1946, Wales was a mixed Hollywood character. CITIZEN KANE has not been identified as a superb film ever seen since it was attacked by Hearst Press and by Hollywood insiders themselves. Wells' attempt to take full control (direction, production, and acting) of his films seems to threaten the whole system. His best work in this period was Edward Rochester's JANE EYRE, which was supposed to have been dubbed Robert Stevenson, but was filmed largely (with Stevenson's blessing) by Wales. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only the STRANGER, a film that took advantage of postwar attention to escape Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood, this was hardly a great record. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recover his critical abilities by producing him around the world in 80 days. But despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter, the musical failed. His failure occurred at the same time as his wife Rita Hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of Gilda. Thus the marriage was conducted on the rocks as well. <br /> <br /> Willis had to make money - his production on Broadway led to his personal bankruptcy. He also sold the idea of ​​a film about Henry Desiree Lander's career to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to be directed at it (who converted it to MONSIEUR VERDOUX) ). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Welles, with a $ 10,000.00 tax bill to worry about, called Cohn and offered to make a movie with Rita as a down payment. Cohen was willing to do this, but he asked naturally what the film was about. It was a wise question. Wells worked in New York in a pharmacy with a books section. He held a book entitled "Lady of Shanghai" and chanted that it was a great film. In a way, Wells Cohen, who is usually smart, convinced Wells that he knew what he was talking about. Cohen said he was looking for rights, and Willis sent an advance payment of $ 10,000.00. After Cohen finished the book of Wales, he bought the book and read it - and found it was so bad. He has spent some time rewriting a treat and script that would enhance the character of Rita from Elsa Panister. <br /> <br /> Sure, there is a strange plot development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor. He saves Elsa Panister, when apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Panister (Everett Sloan), a well-known parole criminal lawyer. She convinces him to hire Michael as the captain of their yacht. The trip also includes Bannister's partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one of Sydney's Broome (Ted De Corsia), who turns out to be an investigator hired by Bannister to see Elsa. When both Michael and Elsa can try to find time together, Brom and Grisby continue to emerge. <br /> <br /> Grisby offers Michael an offer - he (for reasons related to his stark theory of modern society) wants to leak out of him, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes obscure here) he can still get his life insurance (though dead?) And use it to escape to the southern seas. Michael will pay $ 10,000.00 if he pretends to shoot Grisby. This actually includes the signing of a document recognizing the murder (Michael does not realize that such recognition would eliminate the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence indicates that Grisby has died). <br /> <br /> Of course Grisby was killed, Michael was arrested for that, and Broome was killed (shot from Michael's gun). Michael has been tried with Bannister, who defends him, and discovers that the latter is doing second class action because he wants to condemn Michael. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual killer and can escape before the jury's decision. He is calm and deposited in an abandoned carnival, which leads to the famous "House of Fun" sequence and the film's finale. <br /> <br /> It's a very confusing movie (as commented). That does not mean it's not worth watching - it's visible. He saw the fighting between Michael and the police at the trial judge's headquarters, knocking the record into the judge's closet and smashing the glass. Or smart use of photography to capture Hayworth diving from a rock, reflected on the rotten Grisby binoculars. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, especially Sloane (probably the best actor role in this film). Glenn Anders was one of the pioneers of Broadway. He rarely made films before The LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his unforgettable Grisby is unforgettable. As Ted de Corsia does very well with Broome - an investigator who is really looking for his own interests, at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, it offers a different view than most of what it has done before (blood, sand, Manhattan tales, strawberry tree are exceptions), sirens are memorable. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a lovable but naïve man who learns the hard way not to believe what he wants to believe in secret. It's not Ken, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES at midnight, but it's a good movie of all.
