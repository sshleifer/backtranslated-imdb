If you understand Czech, you can see it in the original language and understand Czech obsession with the "pros." But if not, "Jedna ruka netlaska" is another great Czech movie. It's funny, dark and very fun. The best compliment I can pay is that you never know what will happen next, but even keep that feeling good in the second and third displays. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of world-class movies and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to home movies, Sverak and many more. Czech humor is inherently dark and often relentless, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This film is quite, it is eccentric and deals with the less beloved aspects of human beings, but beneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this and most of the other projects involve Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for just that reason - anyway, it's as close as ever for the Czechs to write a really happy ending ...
