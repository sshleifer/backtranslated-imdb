Cusack does his best David Niven in this, although I do not know if anyone by my side noticed it. <br /> <br /> When viewed with this in mind, he wants to be taken more seriously. Of Austin Powers but still very beautiful, rephrasing a classic comedy that is not appreciated. <br /> <br /> Hilary Dove is preparing a singer-song version of Britney Spears from Mata Bond. The book designed a slightly reverse development in Oedipus's plot - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how quiet Montel was until this movie ... I think he found a new call that synthesized the sounds of the navigation system!
