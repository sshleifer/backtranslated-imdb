- After their sons were sentenced to life in prison, Adele (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) began receiving threatening phone calls because someone easily lost their children. The couple decide to move to California to escape from publicity for the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that works very soon. One of the students has a rich unmarried father Adele falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming somewhat fascinated by the radio announcer. It is only a matter of time before everything collapses, and women enter into a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can only compare what is the matter with Helen? "Who killed Aunt Roe?", Starring Chile Winters. As this film seemed almost constrained in his introduction to the madness of Aunt Roe, there is nothing to hinder Helen in this film. It may take a long time to run the movie, but as soon as it settles, Helen is one of "Bad Mad Motta". Do not want to mess with it. Winter is so enjoyable that it was impossible for me not to enjoy it. It will not spoil the film, but things that Helen is able to overcome completely. <br /> <br /> - As good as the Winters, Reynolds is very silly in her role as a gold-digging dancer tap. I have the impression that she thought she was in a film that would nominate her for a prize. This is not Ken Citizen! Getting off work is very serious. Hello Debbie, do not realize that your main goal is to be a victim of the Winters madness. <br /> <br /> - I just love these female stars ex-Twilight - from horror movies career. What is the matter with Helen? It is as fun as any.
