It was so great fun! I have never read those comic books for Chester-Gould-comics, but I do not need to know them. There may have been some inner jokes that I did not know, but what you do not see the heart's eye can not grieve. This is a colorful film of irony and all actors enjoy a sense of humor. The setting is similar to Batman`s movies, but not as bold and gray. Well, the story is not original, but there is a plot (not intuitive) and a more surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie, you can play an exciting game, if you watch it with friends. Do not see the credits at first and then see who is the fastest to discover who are the famous actors under their makeup!
