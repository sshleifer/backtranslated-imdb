I rented this movie when I appeared on a video and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on a DVD a few weeks ago and have seen it many times since then. I had to agree with others when they said that the Indian summer was a compassionate film. When I watch him I wish I was 10-14 again. I think that's why we all love the movie fairly. We all hope that sometimes we can restore our lives as children with wisdom / knowledge of adults. Is not it nice to have all your friends / parents are young again? Do not worry about your work, being a parent etc ... ??? I know I want to jump to De Lorient and come back in time. Although I enjoyed my favorite camp film at all, Meatballs with Bill Murray hope they can make the Indian summer version of it.
