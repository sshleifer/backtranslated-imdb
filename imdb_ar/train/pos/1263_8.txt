I enjoyed this film, and I gave it mainly because I enjoy watching Sean Connery and he has the added bonus of Ed Harris and Laurence Fishburne. The story contains the grandmother who seeks help for Connery because her grandson is in prison and says he was wrongly convicted. At first it seemed that there might be some racist aspects of the case, but later it turned out that the main officer in the case was black himself and appeared to have done some bad things to force the child to confess. Well, the boy tries to point to another murderer locked up in the same prison, about to die. He is also a very bad person, because he is very pleased with what he has done, writes relatives of his victims and tries to urge people to send them by mail. A lot of twists and turns in this one with each other is somewhat unexpected. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery in an attempt to understand the whole ordeal. The film has also bothered me in the areas, especially when you discover what happened in the end. You get a very good interaction between Conrey, Harris, Connery and Schwerin, where everyone glows well in this game. In the end this one makes the suspense / suspense fairly good.
