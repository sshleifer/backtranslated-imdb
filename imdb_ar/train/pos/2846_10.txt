I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who watched this movie a few minutes ago ... and I want to thank the people who worked on creating this movie! It's not the best or the best the most .... but touched my heart ... why ??? I want to understand it myself ... It's easy and accessible ... It's a movie that makes you feel comfortable after a bad day without any remorse. About lost time watching it! It is about love and care, about the life we ​​have but we sometimes miss because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have but miss him. ... Why do we do that? We need to live as if we were dying ... We care about every second and remember: if we do good things, the good things come back to us! He has a special taste in New York ... I love this town and the world we live in! Thank you very much for the film and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
