I can not believe this movie has been rated 6.9. In any case, it was probably one of the most real Hindi movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to watch a movie showing traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was wonderful, and it was about Shahid Kapoor's arranged marriage with Amrita Rao. It is a kind of lucky luck, a lucky man, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who helps her uncle but the only problem is that her cousin does not receive as much attention as her aunt Amrita hates with emotion. This disturbs Amrita because she only wants her aunt to love her. It was very impressive to see that although Amrita's family were not rich perhaps from the middle class to the lower class, while the Shahid family were quite upper class, they still treated their families with respect and did not even demand their status in fact hit the nerve With me. This is because I actually saw that people are very rude for people who do not think well about their standards which I feel is very shallow. This film showed that the family of martyrs was ready to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had raised and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not the daughter of a business tycoon or anything. All in all this movie deserves 8/10 I wish more and more of this kind of movies.
