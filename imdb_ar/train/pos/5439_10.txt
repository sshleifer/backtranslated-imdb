It is clear that the film had a great impact not only on the type of friends but on the type of movement as well. George Lucas had to be impressed by this, as much of his "Star Wars" series appears to be a tribute to Gunja Dean. The characters played by Grant, McLaughlin and Fairbanks are just precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Shobaka. Even Sam Gaffe from Gunga Din turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and liked it: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> This film is seen today as not a personal computer, but there is a speech by Eduardo Cianelli as Guru, leader of the Indian opposition to the British Raj, who can be rumored by the feelings of many today. <br /> <br /> For a boy this was a great movie. Three strong male filaments and a simple hint of romance. There was a time when the young boys considered kissing the girl in Saturday's movie Just Music. Not like today when more skin is greeted with cheerfulness. It is too late to lose innocence. <br /> <br /> We hope that this movie will not be forgotten and that a few of the channel users will stop at TCM and pick up a movie with adventures and adventures and play thousands instead of CGI representatives.
