Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a fan of Sandler. This film is the saddest story of Sandler. His expression is wonderful. I cried more watch click but there are some similar points. Thinking about the value of a family before you lose it and being able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive facts in life ... It's tough, it's real ... and in fact there's a fact of success, Binder. I do not think another way out can give these feelings that way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorite things since the crash. Do not expect laughter or positive atmosphere a lot ... If you are prepared to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
