Alice (Claire Danis) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsil) were the best friends since forever and after graduation they decided to make a trip to Thailand. Because of an incident, they meet a strange mysterious young man inviting them to go with him in Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene make a mistake in drug trafficking and are sent to jail. Now is the time to stay in the end and true friendship. It was a very good film, I saw it several times, and after a while I noticed that there were some holes in the plot but the film still keeps you entertained. Claire Danis did a great job as usual, she is a wonderful actress. I would give Procidon Palace 8/10
