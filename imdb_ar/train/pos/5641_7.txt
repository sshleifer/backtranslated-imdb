Yes, the plot is predictable. Yes, there are some holes in the plot. Yes, it has a quality manufactured for television; and yes, Britney Spears wrote the book with a clear promotion of self. <br /> <br /> But forget all this ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun at the after school school is a special kind of way, but nonetheless fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as a mother doing a great job ... so good that I'll start watching her movies. She reminded me of Lin Lin for all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also does a good job. If you are a special customer, I will discover some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are higher than the standard television standards and the music was really fantastic ... better than the many big budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you're in a mood for German, this is not for you. If you want a movie that is safe, fun and degrading, it's a good movie. It's one that can show for your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too.
