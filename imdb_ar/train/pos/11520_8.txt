The Perfect Road Movie ... if your idea of ​​a road movie includes three potential magicians with dialects from Eastern Europe and Claire Forlani. (Well, one out of four is not bad ...) A talentless wizard looking to emerge (Max) watches a skilled little wrestler (Hugo) as he trades in New York. After Hugo is convinced that he (the maximum) is (mentally) and (b) in dire need of a partner to realize his dreams of becoming a witch on stage, the non-dynamic duo enlists the management experience of the delusional inventor (Milo), and, ah, Beautiful (Lydia). It is unlikely that four cars will accumulate in a car (obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it came from) and headed for Vegas. The devastation ensues. Anyway, it's funny, it's well written, and the end is surprisingly good. A strong comedy with a warm heart, and better yet it was quite unexpected.
