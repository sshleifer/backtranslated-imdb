The YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegant and cloned historical story that takes advantage of some of the good settings and strong guidance of Jean-Marc Valais from the powerful Julian Philwelts version of the youth series that was to become England's longest-reigning king. A large part of the first part of the film, that part when Victoria is a child, her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) compete for their ascension to the throne, and seem to be trailing and losing in multicolored costumes and scenes. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) becomes a teen and is ruled by Prince Albert (Robert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that the line between volcanic fascination and royal dignity makes her a great frustration for those in court who seek to control the "Queen of Children" - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Petani). But when she is mature in her role as Queen, she looks at the broken Prince Albert, a love affair that continues in everyone's memories of the idea of ​​joining royalty with caring for her subjects - thanks to Albert's sensitivity. The film takes us to the birth of their nine children, and then ends with some words about the influence of Queen Victoria and the influence of Prince Albert on various franchises throughout Europe! It makes an evening of beautiful fashion drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Robert Friend. Solid if not transfer epic. <br /> <br /> Grady is a runaway
