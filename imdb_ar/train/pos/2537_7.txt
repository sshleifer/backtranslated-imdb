Boris and Bella are working well together in this film, whether they are against each other, or blasphemy the boat itself. I saw this in 1972, and I just bought from Borders this year. This time I noticed with my children two things: I caught the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old child; some of the things I did not do when I first saw her caught on. A very fast story with an unexpected end. Must amateur movie!
