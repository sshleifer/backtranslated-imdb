I lived with a roommate who tried to commit suicide. Our apartment was in a building where you could get a $ 50 snooze for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily deal with "The Tenant" in Polanski. <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. I'm not sure it works, in general - Polanski's descent into paranoia and madness, which takes half an hour or so, seems rather strange. Ebert, for example, was not quite convinced, and he slapped the film with a one-star review. But I think the viewer and individual moments work beautifully, although I do not fully understand the entire film - what does Egyptology have to do with it, for example? - I still have a positive general impression about it. <br /> <br /> I love the hateful friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson, for example. Oh my God, how many times have I settled on having such stupid friends instead of having no friends at all! I love the movie scene - the most extreme moment "made" in the film's history. And boy, do I like Isabelle Adjani - it's very mysterious in this film, it's almost unbelievable. It offers great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with the disdainful remarks he made about his performance here. His character is supposed to be low and deliberate, so his low performance is appropriate. On the one hand, I found him quite sympathetic - although he lost me a little when he started wearing his clothes for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is mysterious. And slow. But it embodies the alien qualities of living in an apartment - something I have done too much - so I dig it. It's funny that all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly an eccentric movie like this has become so important! Definitely worth picking pocket change on the DVD.
