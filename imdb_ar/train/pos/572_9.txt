In response to the person who made the comment about how the movie continues and who thinks there is no purpose to the role of Jess's brother here is my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to present an exciting paradox in the story. Craig Scheffer / Norman could have predicted the problems associated with living life to the fullest by looking at how Jess's brother was transformed. There are many cases where Brad Pitt runs his life in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother Craig Scheffer takes a broken bar and Brad finds a house there a few days later. The dramatic paradox existed, so Craig Scheffer's character would experience more emotional turmoil at the death of his brothers, knowing that he could have done more to prevent it and thus create a more convincing mood in the film.
