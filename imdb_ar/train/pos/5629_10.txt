I love this excellent film. Farah Fawcett played the role tremendously and with a good heart. She plays the role of a woman led to strict measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After the police refused, she realized she was alone. <br /> <br /> Then one day when the alien broke into her home alone and attacked her again. She does not want to call or remove the police. She is forced to spray it in her eyes and lock him in her stove. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need for a wake-up call on the laws of the land. They are very easy on these criminals. It is time for more harsh sanctions.
