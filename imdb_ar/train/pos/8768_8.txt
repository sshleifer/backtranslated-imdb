I saw this movie in a shop in a cheap section. She clearly remembered seeing commercials and trailers for her years ago. I thought "What a thing" and bought it, mainly because the plot seemed interesting and Claire Dance was always a talented person in my eyes (this was also before he became a big fan of Beckinsell). <br /> <br /> So it comes to two girls sneaking into a holiday in Bangkok, being tricked by drugs (which are innocent of them), then being sent to a Thai prison. The film follows what happens to them, and sometimes asks their innocence. <br /> <br /> Claire Denis and Kate Beckinsell make great performances, unraveling the film's own intriguing plot, and raising some of the mildest moral questions of debate. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good good film, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been longer ... It was possible to help entrench these characters and further insight into the policy of the judicial system in Thailand has helped. <br /> <br /> However, otherwise, it's a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all its pop culture advocates are looking for a two-minute role by Paul Walker. I did not notice it the first time I saw the film.
