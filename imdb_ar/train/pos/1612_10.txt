This film stands straight and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedy. It's almost flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and compassion are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is delightful and fun! <br /> <br /> Each character is unique and fun, from performances by Sher and Nicolas Cage, to many supporting roles - Olympia Dukes, Vincent Gardinia, John Mahoney, Danny Aylo - even the grandfather with his dog's pack! Each of these artists, in addition to Norman Jayson as director, performs above their normal quality in this teamwork. For many actors, this was a great early show in the film, so the acting is also exceptional - and we have many current actors whose career has been effectively changed in this film. <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie many times all the way - which can sometimes reduce the impact of the film significantly. More importantly, I realized a few years ago that the more I walked through the channel on my way to a scene from this film - any scene - the scene was convincing and beautifully made. There are many amazing and memorable scenes in the original encounter between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his wack story; Vincent Gardenia has discovered his outstanding opera counterpart, amidst the magnificence of the gold miner's plumbing; Olympia Deckis yells John Mahoney For a hint with his student in the classic line about relationships with his co-workers: "Do not miss where to eat!" ; Danny Ailu when his mother's dying bed; Nicholas Cage "takes" Cher as the trance of the song trance in the background! <br /> <br /> There are of course many wonderful romantic comedy films, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden's original); when Harry met Sally; <br /> <br /> Nothing is exactly equal to Moonstruck!
