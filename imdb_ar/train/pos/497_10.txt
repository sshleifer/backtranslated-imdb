Call me teen, but I really think this is a fantastic series. If you do not have a chance to try a few Star Trek episodes, you should definitely watch this episode. Perhaps more convincing than Voyager's Caretaker, who launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are quite different, but strangely familiar ... the music is very attractive. No real fan of science fiction can go without seeing at least one Star Trek ring - and these premiums make the wait useful.
