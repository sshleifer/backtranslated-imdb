It's not Braveheart (fortunately), but it's a wonderful entertainment with attractive characters and good disposition everywhere. I enjoyed this movie when it was shown and after watching it again last week, I found it held up over time. It is not a classic film, but it is a wonderful film and scenes to enjoy a wonderful entertainment.
