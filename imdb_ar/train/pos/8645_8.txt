I have watched this film for several years and it has had a lasting effect on me. Unfortunately, I have been encouraged by many films over the years and I did not expect California to be watching them again. I am happy to say that it looks as disturbing and as lively as it was 10 years ago or so. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this film its strength. The first is cast. We have an amazingly alarming turn by young Brad Pitt's early grace. Knowing that Pitt, as we all do, is one of the most heart diseases Hollywood has ever seen, it is refreshing to see him play such a despicable and unattractive character. Attracts the show house without resorting to cliché or spoofing white trash, and can remain truly terrifying throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is equally admired as a tragic friend of Grace, playing a character like ten years old. A 40-year-old girl. Louise has been able to raise pity (for her personality station in life) as well as disdain (for her naiveté), but she supports her performance with a precision that is rarely seen by a very young boy actor. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that neither House nor Lewis have been nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Dochovoni and Michelle Forbes are portrayed as a wonderful couple who ended up traveling unintentionally across the United States with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is eccentric and naïve, and Forbes seems ridiculous and stops working, but both actors are able to portray their characters' changes convincingly as if they are both intrigued, repulsed and attracted to a home. <br /> <br /> This wonderful film catches us with wonderful balls through perfect strikes through impeccable speed. At the time of the release of the film "California," Hollywood launched a large number of films with a nice character that turned into a psychic character ("White Female Whale", "Pacific Heights", "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle," "Tricked "," Sleep with the enemy ", etc.). Most of these films followed the same formula, and the only difference is the nature of the relationship between the good man and the bad guy. "Calvernia" is not far from this region, but its first two acts are a great example of slow excitement, and we remain on the edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn. <br /> <br /> When the price of a penny drops, and Pitt is allowed to play the role of the obsessive man, the film moves the gears completely and in the last twenty minutes does not live up to the rest of the film. However, the procedure is thick and fast and the decision is cool. The battle is over, but scars will always exist. <br /> <br /> Much of the narration (provided by Duchovony before the fairly small X files) is intrigued by the boy. Of course, it is supposed to be the book written by the character of the journalist in Duchofone, so it can be said that self-conscious narration is meant to be a reference to the kind of exciting style that most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film has achieved great success and is certainly more than 90% of thriller films in the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for weak stomach or mind. This movie is disturbing on more than one level. But then, supposed to be.
