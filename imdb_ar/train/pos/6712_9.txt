I love Sabrina! It's one of my FV shows! My favorite episodes are; those in which Libby turned into a maniac, the first episode, a true love ring, and the rest of the first series. I think college seminars were not as good as high school but they were better than the last string that was awful. Valerie was a good character because she was almost more than Jenny, but Jenny was in some great episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and there seemed to be no explanation of where they went! Libby was a very good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, she was not as good as her other friends.
