An excellent conspiracy plot within a plot. Shame on two heroes of my film having a good arrogant. You must be my teacher :) Very good by everyone. You never know who will run from. Another small twist in the end allows everyone to get their fair hybrids. <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone. An unflattering tongue in the cheek film that if it had any flaws, Michael Keane is probably excessively used for the word "bloody", but that's his signature, is not it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
