One of those beautiful intense films that attracts us to the limit, ends soon! From the left they looked at the screen like, "No they did not!" , Lol. Offers good everywhere! Great acting with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I realized that it would provide a strong and compelling performance that captures the attention, mood and vulnerability of the young people of Victoria throughout the film. Also, production is wonderful in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. She recounted a remarkable glimpse of a remarkable time in the history of Britain through a very personal and influential biography of the school-age princess until her reign as Queen, and later married Prince Albert, rather than ending with the birth of her nine children. The script was well written and flawlessly edited. Robert Albert, as a patient and compassionate Prince Albert, who was competing to win the attention of the young queen, was more than secure her love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Petani) was seen. It was also the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, who were sometimes angry, as was the case with her mother and King William (who also hated her mother). The acting and the scenes were captivating, very passionate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation of that era, and indeed anyone who loves a true romantic romance is convincing
