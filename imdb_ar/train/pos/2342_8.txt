I watched Pie last night and the word that comes to mind is the word "original". It's a word that is not much used on television because they all tend to copy what the other network does and eventually end up with seven nights of crime shows, comedy and the absurdity of reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me like bricks was the presence of Jim Del. Those who are not familiar with the British "Carrie En ..." series or those who have not listened to the Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with the beginner. I'm not sure if his presence as Crowe adds or distracts attention. I will have to adjust more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. This may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (the notorious White Countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He collaborates with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is so good and funny so it happens to love childhood, Anna Frail (goal! Dream begins, schedule) and things really complicated. It can not send and can not touch it. Boy, that would make the relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will exactly find out where this series is going in the hope that it will continue to entertain.
