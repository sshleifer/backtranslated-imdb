James Cane is known for his hard roles and bandits, but he also played great characters in his career. This music is one of them and was the first but not the last musical to be added by Cagney. <br /> <br /> So Cagney is singing in this section and also has a great deal of dancing. It must be said that it was not bad at that. The role plays with great confidence. He seems to have had some dance jobs in his early life before his acting career began to take off a great time, so in fact, it was not surprising that he did some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels comfortable in this kind quite different from what most people used to see him. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who may have been among the best and most successful directors of this genre. . His first music in the 1930s largely identified this genre and was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musical plays were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like nothing else really. 'The music of the 1930s was never singing at all, it was more evident in the 1940s and later in musicals, mainly from the MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, her story is light and simple, placed in the musical world, this of course is predictable and progresses in a way that equates. However, it's a fun and simple story that makes these movies just fun to watch. As well as with the characters and actors they portray. A bit of aberration, although the whole line of the film is abandoned at the end of the film, when the film begins to form only from the music routine. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the end of the film are amusing and improved, although I'm not a big fan of this kind of film. Once again the musical numbers are also characterized by young Billy Barty. He often played the role of young boys / children / mice and more often in his early career, including the musical "Gold Diggers of 1933", released a year ago. <br /> <br /> Recommended movie type early. <br /> <br /> 8/10
