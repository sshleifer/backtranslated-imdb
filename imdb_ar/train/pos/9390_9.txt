I started this film in Nick Cage's kick. It is a story full of transformations and turns - a film of motives and moves. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a pig, but JT and Laura and Flaine Boyle were the right couple to catch the reassuring guy on the Internet. All about this good movie - the cinema, the pace of the story, and most of all. Cage excels at what he does better - not to be a movement hero, but to be every man trapped in life.
