She became a fan of the television series "Murder: Life on the Street" late in the show, but I became a fan very quickly. It was an unprecedented police parade: it was visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, where it captures scenes everywhere, in its multi-ethnic and multi-ethnic forms and diverse and brilliant characters, and covered all the good and evil police department, including corruption and personal clashes that float on the roof. <br /> <br /> Murder: The film, following the reunion of the series, is as good as a film made specifically for television. After shooting at Lieutenant Giardello (Yavette Cotto), now candidate for mayor of Baltimore, the team members returned to help find the killer. In addition, the team members who left the force and who died, also managed to get a place in the film. The intensity and the fire that characterized the chain, and the textual whiskers with the same fire that characterized the chain. All in all, a great TV movie. <br /> <br /> Voting: 9
