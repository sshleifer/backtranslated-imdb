Gray Gardens is a world in itself. Edith and Little Eddie live in almost complete solitude, eating ice cream and liver slot in a temporary kitchen in the common bedroom (apparently). Cats calm down while Edith maims her daughter's engagement. This Tennessee Williams play is alive and should inspire scriptwriters and playwrights, as the strange and intertwined dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother, her 50 daughters, lived for ten years (except that they were poor and clean). They were chatting all day, Grandma talking about her glorious ideal past while her daughter constantly blamed her for lost opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen by anyone who writes the relationship of the mother / daughter of this kind. It's sad and sober, but the filmmakers did a great job of getting Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves recklessly. It is rare to see real life in this way, especially looking at the context - the remains of a strong family that fade into the skeleton of its palace.
