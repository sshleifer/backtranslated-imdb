I find that Loretta Young is generally hard to take, very interested in her appearance and very polite in all the wrong ways. But in this romantic romance Frank Borsage, although she plays a difficult role in self-esteem and bears a lot of bullying from Barnes Spencer Tracy, she is direct, honest and irresistible. It's a weird little movie, often played in a one-room cottage in Hooverville, unusually advanced about depression but romantic and perfect. Tracy, who plays the role of an "ordinary young man" who is troubled, can hardly be complacent and thrives to today's standards, easing the edge of his solid character and making him almost attractive. There is good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got what they should never be), and Joe Swerling's script is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borsage, who always liked to represent real love in a close-up lyric, and Young. You want to slap her and tell her character wise, she's very good for this guy, but she's very convincing and convincing, you see her story with the most satisfaction and it comes to a satisfactory conclusion.
