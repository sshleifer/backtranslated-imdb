This show has been an escape from reality over the last ten years. I will regret it. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on TV anyway) was made beautifully. Robert wrote something he felt close to reality. As if trying to explain what was the case in the display set. (Each person working closely together for a long period of time linked up and down, but over the years they have become a family). I thought this was a great way to end it despite anyone else's criticism. <br /> <br /> Study Group 1 was something special and time and time again I passed through the boundaries of infidelity and surprise. Great characters, stories, directors and writers. From the first episode I was hooked. The mix of work, science, drama and especially comedies worked well, making me want more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express the meaning of this offer to me. I can only thank those who have kept the exhibition fresh and enjoyable for many years. It inspired me to do a lot of things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to movies next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I never want to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
