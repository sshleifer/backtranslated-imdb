I got to see this movie in preview and dazzled it. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I can not remember laughing so hard at the film and being touched by it. The laughs are not cheers here - it's the notes, the laughs of recognition, the little shocks of "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only person who felt that way!" I will not give up the plot, which is more than a "man falls in love with his brother's friend." The whole family plays a role in the relationship here. Probably the best combination of laughter and warmth since "while you're asleep". <br /> <br /> Steve Karel has become much deeper than he ever was, and for the first time I really liked him. Amazingly wonderful, a list of veteran actors whom I loved in other roles, but they mix to create a convincing family. Diane West is as beautiful as the mother, Juliet Pinochet is luminous and dazzling (who she knew was funny?), And even Danny Cook's mask gives a warm, quiet and touching performance. The soundtrack for Sondre Lerche is a great addition, and I will buy the second CD available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the opportunity to record this sound.
