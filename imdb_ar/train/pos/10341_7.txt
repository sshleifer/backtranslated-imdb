It was a real farce in the screaming comedy situation in the mid 70s this huge hit movie for 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am always surprised by some of the comedy films that produce a big week and then fade: the great anxiety and cheap detection and black birds and not to look now we are now showing pictures in ......... and do not have a profile at all today. Norman was a comedy all over the year in 1976. Everyone seemed to see him, laughing at him, and never mentioning him. NORMAN is best known for filming a video and transferring it to a film, an experience at the time, a politically incorrect farce that shakes the treasury and the Farrelly Brothers should consider remaking it today. If they do this in the first place, there will be no complaints about their content and the small ones. It's very funny and yes very rude and funny all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact as a wonderful film in 1976 with all those colors and awesome clothes, it works better today.
