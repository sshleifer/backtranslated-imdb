This was a great success at the South Bay South West (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin last year, featuring an impressive collection directed by Gloria Rubin of EE. R, and John Glower chew. Although filmed on a small budget in New York City, the film looks great and takes us behind the scenes through a rehearsal and the rise of what the actors call "the Scottish play" as a reference to the word "Macbeth" believed to bring the curse of the old play. The acting company shows all the same feelings of play, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion, and a little fun as well. The games start when one of the leading actors (in the lead role) is replaced by a famous "beautiful face" from the television opera scene in order to attract larger crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds well. The soundtrack is beautiful, and the performances are good everywhere. The DVD includes the director's commentary and some deleted scenes as well.
