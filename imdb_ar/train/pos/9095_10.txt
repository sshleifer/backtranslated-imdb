A charming and funny film gets a solid score everywhere. I saw a screening of this film recently at work. It was very good to see this film unlike all the horror movies I see every day. So much so that I thought I would write. I'm not sure if this movie will go to the theaters, but I hope it happens. It's a nice movie to watch with friends, it's a magician, and he has some funny jokes. The acting was very good (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf) The output was very good (not a film that needed to be directed too much.) What makes this film really stand out is the writing: like Neil Simon and Seinfeldch and the joking between characters is clever and has a great rhythm, , I noticed these things! (I'm stupid.) Anyway, a really nice movie I recommend it.
