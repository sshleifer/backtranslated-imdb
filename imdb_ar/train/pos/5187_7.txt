This series was similar to what you expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is really one of those scary and funny childish scenes that you will never forget. Just like the external border (another fantastic display) this small chain does what many can do. It was wonderful and deserved to run longer. It was a wonderful show, so that the kids could see what happened, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but they all had always had a moral ending (like Twilight Zone) that made you aware of the situation you did not want to It ends up, or the ones that did. I remember seeing some of these things on Sci-fi when I was 10 years old, and so far, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Really fun, fantasy show. I loved him and still love him.
