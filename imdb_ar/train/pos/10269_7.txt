In the classic spirit "The Sting", this movie hits the place that really hurts me ... in the heart! She meets an introductory psychologist who is thirsty for adventure with the dirtiest and worst villains. The weak doctor falls on the badman career, begging to participate in surgery. While the film moves somewhat "slow", it is at its peak and ends up stunning! You will especially enjoy how to "forgive the doctor"!
