I'm going to change the standards here a bit and say I enjoyed this. However, the cartoons will attract those who have very silly tendencies. Certainly something that most people will not get, as well as the nature of absurdity. <br /> <br /> The animation is awesome, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul-mouthed, violent and stupid. Do not replace qualities at all. His wife cries and cries, apparently barely able to basic communication skills. Most of these stories lack quite any kind of points. <br /> <br /> But again, this is the point;) <br /> <br /> If non-sequencing, foul and full random language is the thing you want. , You will love this. <br /> <br /> It's really short, so maybe I'll hire it instead of buying.
