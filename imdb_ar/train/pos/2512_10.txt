Being a great admirer of Japanese entertainers Gackt and Hyde, I was very excited when I discovered they had made a film together and made my job in life see him. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are more than actors, I was ready for courage but not actually performing well, but I am happy to say that both of them managed to keep me fascinated by the story as it continued. Moon Child enjoys the right amount of humor, movement, romance and serious moments that pulse the heart. I can not say that I cried more than ever in a film and these more tender moments act admirably by the husband, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The scenes of fighting are absolutely amazing, and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get to the movie and start associating with the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who like Jake and Hyde.
