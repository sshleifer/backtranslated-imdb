Because the movie was not seen in the original version, I was pleasantly surprised when the DVD arrived, because this film did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /> <br /> For the first time, Denzel Washington and the final producer have something to envy other films on the same subject by more accomplished directors. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot on the other side of the camera. Brings a different angle to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the good performance of Derek Luke. He's a representative, with the right guidance, will go away, no doubt. His dealings with the troubled young man, at this stage of his life, in the turmoil and suffering for a bad life, so far, deal with him, is very real. Antwone has a wonderful picture of a man suffering from a pain that is very good and has much to offer, but no one seems to see this aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst of his despair, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very discreet way, if somehow defeated. Because of the tightness within Antwone, he misses the opportunity to open himself to this man, who wants help, but because of the restrictions on his office, only three sessions and then forced to expel his patient. <br /> <Things work, because Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Anthony's past was revealed in detail. The mistreatment of Ms. Tate, his foster mother, is at least brutal. Attempted by an elderly woman in Tate's house of sexual harassment, Anton gives him a bitter taste throughout his adult life, fearful of the shame he carries with him. <br /> <br /> Anton finally found love with Cheryl, who was patient enough to make him see a different world through the love she gave her and the support she gave him. <br /> <br /> The lead shows are already very good. Dr. Davenport of Denzel Washington has his own problems as well. He's not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can not help himself, or his relationship with a wife she loves. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes Cheryl fine. Nevillea Nelson, a beautiful actress, is as wonderful as Mrs. Tate, the abused mother of the incubator. <br /> <br /> Anton is reunited with his anonymous, sleepy and emotional family, but of course, if the person is to believe Fischer is finally happy, one has to accept this part of the film as well.
