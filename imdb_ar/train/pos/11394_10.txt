While the story is sweet, dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is a dream sequence. It is characterized by a blend of the highest forms of authentic American music (Gershwin), the attractive beauty of French impressionist art, and the charming Curry design (including "pas de de d'orouur"). Reconciling the rising music and the visual explosion with these dances was a real work for creative geniuses and a wonderful artist.
