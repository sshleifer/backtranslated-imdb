I have a six month old baby at home and from time to time fight bad sleep really. One morning she had trouble sleeping when Doodle bops appeared on T.V. I stopped crying almost immediately and the rest of the show was satisfied. She sat in her pulsating seat and watched her shake her legs, swing her arms and laugh at this show. I kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also got a video of them so that sometimes when my little baby is confused, I have something to comfort her. Granted, late at night if you wake up from the colic to stir up a bang that the doodle is not its own cup of tea, but it certainly comes handy when I need a little time to do housework, etc. The big surprise about bops bops is that my baby does not like Watch TV She even prefers playing in a game or with our little poodle game of T.V. I do not know whether she will continue to like her in the future, but she is now tied to her.
