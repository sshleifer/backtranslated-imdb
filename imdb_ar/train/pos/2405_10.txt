Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only one to post a comment on this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this film is Matt Lillard, given to most people may think either he is very happy with caffeine or only absorbs but we are in the same Old and the same generation I have seen this man so many times that it is one of my favorites now. This is one of the few films where the film is a favorite film in SLC Punk, another wonderful Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> Baiscally this is the story of your usual movies, but with more transformations than anything else, you begin to live up to the level of insanity. Also featured in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'Onofrio, a highly regarded filmmaker. The women in the movie are coming new and are not too bad although you know they hired her mainly because of her accent and the nude scene =) <br /> <br /> It's Jack vs. Generation vs. Bob because they both want to earn rewards but share them with Anyone. Almost all try to kill the other, a time bomb waiting for the explosion. Matt shows his true talent like the JAck scheme that starts at the beginning of the entire scheme. Vincent and the woman play some professional thieves who need money because of lack of business. Vince's character is distorted and slightly fickle in the film, but adds only to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The left and right surprises are welcome and the end is very vulgar and make you feel happy, maybe depending on the type of endings you want. This film kept me very interested in the fact that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics may not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they love movies anyway.
