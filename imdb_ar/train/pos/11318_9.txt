This is a strong and influential Italian adaptation of the novel The Postman Always Rings Twice by Luciano Visconti. What is interesting in the film is that in every way it goes beyond the source material to become bolder and more original (interestingly Camus also attributes Caen's novel as a major inspiration to his historical novel The Stranger). The film has a greater intensity and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the cinematic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but it offers a more complex exploration of gender. The American novel Cain is very uncomplicatedly fascinated by the construction of whiteness (the main character in Cora fears that she is obsessed with being identified as Mexican and embarrassed by her marriage to a Greek immigrant), which has nothing to do with the Italian rural context in which Visconti is working. This allows class discounts to take center stage and dance between the republics of the emotional love relationship afflicted by the two main characters. This film is a complex, exciting and rewarding experience.
