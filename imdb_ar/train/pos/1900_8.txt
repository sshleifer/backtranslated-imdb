The late Dudley Moore played the most famous role in Arthur's very short career in 1981, a funny and fun story that generates warm smiles, big belly laughs, and sometimes tears if you are in a good mood. Moore received Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "races cars, plays tennis and loves women, but spends weekends and is his boss." Arthur is estimated to inherit $ 750 million when he marries an arrogant society girl named Susan Johnston (Gill Eikenberry), the pampered daughter of secret gangs. Things get tough when she meets Arthur Linda Moreola (Lisa Minelli), a waitress / actress struggling from Queens stealing neckties for her father's birthday. Moore has lit the screen in one of the most popular shows in the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gilgod won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his impeccable role as the butler used by Arthur and his best friend, Hobson, whose external distrust of Arthur's behavior further pushes parental affection. There are other funny contributions made by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Steven Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Old Lady Arthur. The film was directed with a keen eye on comedy by a first-time director named Steve Gordon, who died, sadly, the following year. There was also a sequel that could be forgotten after several years, but should not miss this classic classics.
