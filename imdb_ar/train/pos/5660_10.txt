I probably saw episode 2 or when the program was originally broadcast but when I watched one episode on netflix I was hooked. I watched the whole string in like 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First, he is completely displeased and then begins to admire the character ("These things have a thousand use")! His people Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson meets Satan the Great. Charming, charismatic, smarmy, uh kind of dangerous and "kind of" means "really". I want to be like him when he grows up. Lucas Black is also wonderful. Very large accents. Anyway, I think this was one of the best television programs ever and you owe it to yourself to see it.
