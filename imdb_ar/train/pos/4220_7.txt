This is where the miniature Ruth Gordon plays the role of mystery mystery author Agatha Christie who captures her niece by marrying in a safe place. Gordon thinks he killed her niece and young boyfriend dying of suffocation, while Gordon travels back and forth to New York. However, he managed to leave some clues and scratches on two safe black deposit boxes and an improvised and well hidden note. Colombo enters the case and suspects it immediately and simply solves the mystery by using its supernatural mysteries. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is at hand as Secretary of Gordon and Metaphysics. I think Hartley is the eldest daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure that her predecessors had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is being shown during an oriental dance series, but I'm always impressed with Skinner anyway. <br /> <br /> The murder is handled well. It's a good conspiracy, and none of the artists or crew deceives anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a five-foot trick. She was over 80 years old and looked at her. There are moments when they swing almost, but they are constantly swirling with magic. Her acting is privacy. You can never be sure they are serious or when you put Colombo and the public on them. It has given some good fonts as well. What humor there comes from Gordon. Colombo does not enjoy any of his recurring comic moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful work by all involved.
