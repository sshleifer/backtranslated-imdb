I enjoyed this film for two reasons. The first is that he has an insight into the world of allegiance in Northern Ireland, which is rarely treated in films, and most of them tell us about the Republican conflict. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they had provided very honest and convincing images of a very abnormal, unhealthy world that many people had not heard about outside the shores of my native country. <br /> <br /> In general, it's an amusing movie gangs with wonderful performances from someone who is in Northern Irish cast cast. Will not move the earth, although it may open up some people's eyes on the mysterious world of pro-paramilitary groups.
