Nina Foch made a strong and amazing performance as the title character of this delightful little gothic. She accepts a position as a secretary in one of the corridors of London society (played brilliantly by Ms. May Witty) and her fearsome son (Boxer George Meziri). Before she knows this, she wakes up to find herself in an unprecedented coastal palace, where Witty and Macready call Marianne and try to convince the servants and the nearby town to be the mad wife of Macready. Of course, this husband can only plan for treacherous acts, and although we know that Julia must finally escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis builds a real passion in answering a question about how to manage it. <br /> <br /> My "Julia Ross" does not have anything stylistic to distinguish it from any number of films that were released in the same time period, but I was surprised at how stable they were together despite their budget in the shoe chain and the B-movie format. There are a few moments that may make you at the edge of your seat, and I found myself originally rooted to Julia as she realizes the plan and starts out superior to her captors. In any other gothic thriller, the heroine had moved away, screaming and beating, waiting for her hero to arrive and rescue her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was to make the heroine in this movie use her brain and know how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
