A bus ride full of passengers during a blizzard. The police closed the bridge - saying it was not safe and they were stuck in a small cafe until the road was cleared. However, after a while, boredom becomes a concern, as it seems that a passenger was not originally on the bus and may be just a foreigner !! This leads to a ridiculous conclusion but also funny in a low-edged way. <br /> <br /> This is another episode of The Twilight Zone. Instead of typical twists or social annotations, this message does not contain a permanent message. However, they are also wonderful and watch, who cares?! Exactly what happens will you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this star is one of the stars of John Hewitt - the face that most of you will learn from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost all cases, he played a real role (like Charles Lane during the same period), but the boy loved to see him - he mastered the great character and was fun at the same time.
