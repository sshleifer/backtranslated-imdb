Elia Kazan, one of the best directors in this country at all, showed that he was equally at home with films. With "Panic in the Streets," Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what will come later, with perhaps his main story, "On the Waterfront," although both films share only water preparation, because they are different visions of different subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot at a location in New Orleans. Daniel Fox's assignment of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories is the basis of the film, as it takes us to places no tourists dared to see when visiting The Big Easy. One of the great assets of this film is a brilliant black and white film by Joseph McDonald showing New Orleans at its best. Alfred Newman's music and Billy Holiday give you a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This film could have been filmed in New York or another big city in the north because it gives us characters that speak more like "broklynese" rather than a southern accent that one might hear in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the film, Jack Ballance, appearing for the first time on his screen, tasting the screen every time one sees it. It was very tough! At the same time, this strong man shows a thin side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, whom he does not know, with a fatal disease. Blackie, this man caresses his sweaty face and runs his hands through the hair of a retarded greedy man with abandon. It is also worth noting that Mr. Ballens and Mr. Mostel seem to have been doing their own exciting work, which is very refreshing because both actors make it seem real. <br /> <br /> The film also features a natural aspect with an introduction from the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. He and his wife later discussed how they seem to be unable to pay for his salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing an ordinary person is not as effective as he does when this actor plays smarter and more powerful people. Barbara Bill Gedis, as a wife, looks like a woman from the suburbs of Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun thanks to Mr Kazan's direction and his wonderful play in the film.
