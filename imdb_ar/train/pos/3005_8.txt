This is still the basic criterion for judging all the golden age prostitutes, taking into account the limited technology and suspicious moral standards of the authorities (on-screen) well against all generations of similar attempts since then on film and television. Fast and furious with lots of Warner Bros. Wipes, thank God there is no time just to pay attention to the love around him, which leads to a wonderful touch on it until the violent end. I never understood why DA had to look for Vance everywhere, I always thought she was overcrowded. He waved as an investigator, but especially Girardot, where the eccentric doctor and personal computer - when a quick look at the second murder victim, inhaled that there were so many people in the world anyway. Of course, it is William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Kurtz as director) who makes the film what it is - when did Powell ever get bored? <br /> <br /> The police army at the crime scene did not "really do a very good job of finding the second body and the unconscious dog!" The best thing is that Vance tells us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders - The only problem is as usual that the summary can not match the total deductive processes presented throughout and the end is somewhat agreed; some can only be Chan, Moto And of course many others conclude this way too.But since it limits Very quickly ... which is somewhat morally questionable, it does not diminish my opinion in the case of KMC as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the publications I have seen at KMC are (at worst) Of the goldfish, so if you are interested in seeing it end up being absorbed.
