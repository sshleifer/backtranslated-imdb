We can still use Black Adder today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is impressive like Prince George and weak Edmund as his great assistant. I love the episode in which guest Kenneth Connor plays a British theatrical role. Every time, says Edmund Macbeth. Who act a bit foolishly to ward off evil spirits. They are the most things you will see. Of course, none of this intelligence and comic genius can be without Ben Tuna and Richard Curtis who stand behind films like Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. The Black Snake is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be clever, exciting and funny at the same time. I was hoping last night in the "Saturday Night" program that Hugh Laurie praises his background in British humor. If the gang in SNL did some research, they would know what treasures Hugh Laurie was giving her.
