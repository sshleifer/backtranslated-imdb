It is hard to say what is emerging at the top, the charm of James Cane and his energy or the sensational excesses achieved by the three major Busby Berkeley artists at closing. I give it a draw, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and fastest of the early 1930s. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds considerably to the story of the beloved story. <br /> <br /> What is the story line? It's about Chester Kent (Kani) who produces musical works, which is now about to get out of business with take over talk. Begins to deliver Prologues, live musical performances made on stage before the film begins. He has the idea to do bigger and more of them and move them around the country. It is a ball of fire and ideas, and it needs all the ideas it can get to keep the production of these things relentless. But the competitor spies on him and steals his ideas. A desk girl wearing a pair of round glasses (Ruby Keller) wanted a chance to dance; his wife appeared saying she had not fired it; a blond gold-haired man was putting his hooks on him; his partners were betraying him ... my God, What then? All of this may sound like a big hug, but everything happens quickly. Kani rolls back and jumps and hits his fingers and barks and sometimes - even the last big number when he goes out singing and dancing - takes only one or two steps to show how it is done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's show a show, our gang" needs to build three shows in three days, so close the doors and let's start training. " These three super codes will include 40 bands, amazing effects, and will mean a rich contract, with forty units of Kent in luxury cinemas ... The entire Apollo movie circle! (Including Anne Southern and Dorothy Lamor; you can quickly discover Southern but more general Lamor) stay in the track, dance to their hearts, laugh, chatter, and look untrue. <br /> <br /> Then the curtains go up where each intro in the separate cinemas is presented, one by one on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo Circle determining that night whether or not he will save Chester's skin. <br /> <br /> First up is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute production featuring a lot of health care, with brides and grooms (some may get married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with " Do not disturb". <br /> <br /> Then go on to the next theater and 11 minutes from the "By a Waterfall" program that may have made the Warner Brothers accountants worried about bankruptcy. This figure is exaggerated - dozens of swimmers, trees, fountains, a huge cave with water slides and a huge swimming pool - do not ever think there was depression. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks - synchronicity, human patterns, legs and arms, and does all sorts of fine things - doing it in the water, with lots of underwater photography. Girls are definitely a game. They come smiling with water in their eyes and still collide with their marks. The whole thing must be incredibly difficult and burdensome. Robbie Keller, who has a few quick shots in the water, is the only one who seems a little cautious. <br /> <br /> Finally, Cagney's crush is finished 11 minutes after Cagney's dance and singing with Keeler to "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of bar girls and their henchmen, which is unusual in terms of mixing. There Kani and Keller dance on the bar, dancing at a table, fighting Kani. There seemed to be fifty or sixty Marines marching, flapping back and forth, and the rifles they tossed and caught. Then ... that's true ... the human image forms Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA Eagle. This may be the only Hollywood production ever made at Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a group of exciting Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> This is entertainment, people. it's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's defenders get a big contract and Nen gets Chester. The film is full of exciting thrillers that make us smile. Ruby Keller is very affectionate and she is seriously inspecting the taps with her arms fluttering and wanting to help her. Joan Blondell makes us forget a lot of Hollywood girls who may be more beautiful but have fewer memories and characters. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs him and beats him, and to Berkeley, a man he has not had much before.
