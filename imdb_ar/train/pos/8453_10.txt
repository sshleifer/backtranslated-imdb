I can write a big enough comment on any of the characters in Gundam Wing, and each of them can lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 wonderful threads that take us across 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains a dialogue you can rotate in your head for months ... years, and then come back and derive a new meaning from, a masterpiece in scriptwriting (although it has a typical Anime feature because of a discrepancy between English translation and translation) ). It contains an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your personal views. <br /> <br /> Relationships between male idols and loving female characters are set aside in this series. The relationship between Heero, Relena, Milliardo and Noin is a joy to watch. The apparent rejection of males is based on an internal disorder that makes women's love (a word not mentioned in the series) necessary for women in the harsh environment of the soldier. Women hunt for aspects of men that we rarely see, if we ever see them, making the leading men more ambiguous. It takes all 49 Heero episodes to show some interest, but it gets there, and when it does, it's useful. <br /> <br /> Then there is a giant robot fight. Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any Hollywood scene fighting battle. Anyone who is less nervous sees a giant robot fighting as a ridiculous cartoon function for children, and it becomes clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robot battles in Gundam Wing contain a large dose of lament, usually involving young rebels fighting for what they believe against a repressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant shifts in tone and focus during each episode make Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, an attractive and thought-provoking study of the potential of the mind and the human body.
