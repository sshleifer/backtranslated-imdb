Rod Serling, of course, was a genius and his mind was wonderful, fun and creative left something of the period he lived and examples on television in that state of evolution. There are no such shows now, but rather a "housewife" flying the slut on EVA Longoria or Terry Hatter, or the horrifying stings of humor and skittish rattle that makes our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> A episode of such representational rigor and habitual genius that I can not help but think that Rod Searling was designing last week's show about Elam, though he was an assistant to the flow of the story. This episode ends with a game, as usual, but shock and humor combine with the special "Serlingesque" ingenuity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
