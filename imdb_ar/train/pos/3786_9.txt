Ying, a Czech-speaking Chinese girl, called for a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department (VES). The first time I saw Samot√°ii (Loners, 2000) was very good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven central characters seem to have a very difficult and dirty life; the Web suggests that this was a common theme among US films in the early 1990s. Their relationships are fragmented, united and united. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters has been designed to be globally negative and neither of them is a positive figure permanently either. Also, you can see how characters control the features of others according to the context; this is a very realistic feature in the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondeej is a young, talented and married surgeon with two daughters. However, he learned that he studied neurobiology only to prove how much he liked another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed that he wears his clothes over and over again as a spike to get to the home of my father Hanka - a house he burns repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka's relationship is very mixed with her parents. I have just decided - by throwing a coin - to separate from Peter who works at a private radio station. Hanka does not view the bourgeois life of her parents as a good example but seems unsuccessful in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible figure, with regard to her friends. <br /> <br /> Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict who seems to have a rather devastating memory of drugs. However, the friends of his band inform Jacob that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka feels disappointed and goes back to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Peter break up, he is organized by Robert, a game maker who also works for a travel agency, whose job is to show ordinary Czech life to Japanese tourists. Robert - who supplies marijuana - is never serious about anything and usually sleeps with many different women; in the end, his mother dies at the hospital and has his own ways of dealing with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word for "spring") that came to Prague from Macedonia works as a mermaid - and will not learn whether she has come to the Czech Republic to see her father or UFOs. Seems somewhat confused but sometimes helps other characters solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Peter works on the radio station and is the only person who likes his job - a job he eventually loses. Announces to his audience that he is separated from Hanka - the way Undige learns the news that makes him happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Undeg wife Linka is always ready to tolerate him and fix their marriage - even after asking Ondeej the magician to make him disappear so that Ondeej can try to capture Hanka again. (The magician pays his debt because he is the brother of a victim of an important car accident. Jakob and Hanka take the victim to the hospital and saves Oneg's life.) Linka also works for the travel agency - as an interpreter - and eventually translates some hysterical scenes of twenty or so Japanese tourists filming Dinner of my parents Hanka. <br /> <br /> The seven characters interact in exciting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague was the smallest of four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems unlikely that all these events will occur among seven people, but it is enjoyable.
