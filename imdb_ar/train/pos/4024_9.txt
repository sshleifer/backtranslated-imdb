I was very fond of this film. You have kept me guessing what will happen before the end. One of the best films about the section I've seen. Ormila Matondkar is also wonderful. This is one of the most personal movies you have seen on the section. It is less common than Gadar, and it is truly an emotional rotary ship where it begins with a single vision of what happens, and emerges completely from the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood fare, but a movie-type home art. The best part of this film is that it does not lead to one of the parties to the conflict being stripped of humanity when focusing on the story of the other side. Do not blame or criticize, but it lets you draw your own conclusions about things.
