My sister and I hired this film because we were in the mood for something tragic and not required to watch it. However, the film exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a representation of a century. It contains very real pictures of the characters inside and most of the actors do a great job. Various stories are baked with real shots of the time that gives them a very unique touch. While watching it, I really felt I was interested in what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to extend an endless exaggeration of praise to Julia Steeles in her portrayal of Katie, she was a wonderful way she stood! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone ..
