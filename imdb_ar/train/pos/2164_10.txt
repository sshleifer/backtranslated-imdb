I watched this last night and was overcome by the story of the heartfelt story, the excellent development of character, and the good karmic style emanating from acting and cinema as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without abandoning much of the plot, it begins with a normal atmosphere that moves to his office every day and becomes an inspiration for dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and diverse characters he meets in his quest to be smooth at the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story contains an introduction to what the dance in Japan is about socially, so it is not easy to learn to dance in Japan just like here in the United States. <br /> <br /> The film is submerged. You will laugh out loud at some sight gags. However, they are also gracious in a way that is difficult to describe. All film characters are taken seriously, as they are, and there is nothing diminished by their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I was thinking about taking social dance lessons with some friends. This happened with a friend who lent me a video about learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because now I'm really obsessed with his experience. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (young children may not get it, but surely teens will bet) and smile at the real care you see repeatedly. <br /> <br /> They will make a new version of "We dance" is a mystery, because it is perfect as it is.
