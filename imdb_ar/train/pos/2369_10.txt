This movie really rocks! Jeff Wincott is awesome in the film! His fight is incredible! He is a fast military artist! Brigitte Nielsen and Matthias Hughes were very good! The task of justice is a film full of motion that is never boring! If you love fighting with amazing nonstop movies, review Justice Today
