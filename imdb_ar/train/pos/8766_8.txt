I've seen this movie a million years ago (exactly 5 years ago) since the first time. In the light of the recent events in which Australian woman Shabelle Corby was imprisoned in Indonesia for the so-called smuggling pot, she decided to watch this film again. I was not allowed to shout from my heart, "because I am a sucker for the hot girls in need (just read my assessment of" chasing the Laurie Shaw. ") Some of my eyes escaped, but they were barely buckets filled with tears. The film was not shocking to these two children at the beginning of their lives in almost inhumane conditions, so why I did not cry I wanted to cry When I rented a movie like this, I would go, to cry as if it was not tomorrow, This movie was simply too short to do so The main planner, and while doing so, threw the psychological side aside, Claire Denis and Kate Beckinsell did an excellent job of portraying the feelings of the two friends, but this film just screamed for more footage of these girls in their frustrating surroundings. You can only see the basic moments (which I consider to be very moving), perhaps because of the bad adjustment.I sometimes felt that these girls were walking around in a postcard.Its relationship with the family members could attract more attention. What is the matter with the relationships between girls and parents (especially between Alice and her father)? You can take a peek at it, but the movie does not present the whole picture completely, unfortunately enough. <br /> <br /> However, this was a great movie, and in the end I had to bite my lips slightly. But I think this has more to do with the acting skills (and appearance) of the actresses (and the music) and then the director. Frankly, I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsell was before I saw this movie (again). Now, I'm impressed! Fantastic movie, as long as you do not expect to be a classic cinema.
