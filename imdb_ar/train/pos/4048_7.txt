Romer spreads his usual image of the French middle class to tell the fashion drama about the difficulties encountered by an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What is more appealing about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the remarkable aesthetics achieved by Romer. The pictures are digitally decorated and made to resemble baroque images. At some moments, you can not really say whether you're watching a movie or a series of photos at the Louvre. Each shot resembles a piece of art. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
