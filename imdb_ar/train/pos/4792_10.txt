The straight story is a multi-level exploration of the well-being and beauty of America. At some level, walking slowly in the heart of the city, it is a good population and sperm Amber, at another level of aging and remember what is important (and forget what is unimportant). David Lynch gives us some time in this film and helps me remember that a lot can be said silently. A wonderful movie will rest with me gently for a while.
