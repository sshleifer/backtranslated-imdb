I do not remember ever seeing this one before tonight and maybe the title looked so normal that it continued to pass through me. But this game is a well-designed western game, with an interesting story that is thrilled by the turn of the good to the centaur. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum descends into a wide open town looking for his wife and their daughter's news, staying for a while as Tamer's town. As usual, good people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the bad guys, but they love the work they bring. It is still valid: relax the drinks and gambling laws and encourage industries, but pretend to denounce the unnatural effects that may occur on ordinary people. What is admirable about this film is Michum's intense portrayal of the irony in cleaning the town of the bad guys, and the villagers' acceptance that his violent methods are the only methods. Favorite thing: The sudden demise of 2 of the bad guys at the Red Dog Salon. The launch of the main saloon was restricted, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of venom. <br /> <br /> In general a very good movie with its only drawback is that it tends to be a little bit poisonous - not good for Do-Gooders who may prefer life-long to negotiate with Evil instead of ending it.
