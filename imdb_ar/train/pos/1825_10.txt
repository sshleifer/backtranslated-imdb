I saw this movie when I was young, and remembered it as one of the first movies I really liked it was not action movies or comedy. So, in my last years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there something in this film. To my surprise, the film stuck to all my expectations. it is a wonderful movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes and beautiful songs (not great, this actually explains why I did not remember he was a musician) and generally benefited a lot from my time. I was surprised that the last films of my childhood that came back did not succeed even in my minimum demand for a decent film, but this film, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just as it made me cry. Maybe it's because of my dog's death recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that's money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the program contains holes, but it does not matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life, because there is nothing perfect, and this movie gets 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 because it simply made me feel.
