I went to see this movie with a group of friends one night. I have not heard much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after I saw him, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that the performance of the actor Giovanni Ribesi needed little attention. But such a small defect, can be overcome. <br /> <br /> Gone is about 60 seconds away from a retired car thief who has to boost 60 rare and strange cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is by no means predictable. So the end must be surprising. I think it's just a fast film driving a car? Well, you're partly right. There is so much more to it. Everyone should take a look at this film.
