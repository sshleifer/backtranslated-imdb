In War, Inc, we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all the war-related activities we are currently conducting in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the exotic films of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater on the outside, you are already halfway to home to appreciate the latest piece of Cusack spelling. Kozak plays the role of a businessman named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Torikistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated state as a cover while waiting to reach his latest goals. While there, he finds himself fascinated by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marissa Tome, followed by the sexist pop star Hilary Duff. We have known Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has been haunting him ever since, and the company's assistant, Marsha Dillon, who runs the whole process for him (played by Farhan Joan Kozak). Although some moments are played appropriately on the top, they are not always the moments you expect and often surprise you with small touches. All managers turn into strong performance. Duff comes and goes but otherwise does a very good job and goes a long way to dispel the Disney image. Tommy was funny but underestimated while Cusack was almost every scene in it. To be fair, they are given good materials. The book turns into a good mistake with enough transitions, twists and phrases to keep you laughing all the way to the expected end. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from ranking higher as the story turns and turns to the path to the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like a broad and physical comedy, there may not be enough here to keep you interested in the entire film. On the other hand, if you like silly comedy and broad spelling, this is for you.
