I never saw the "Next Action Hero" show, and to read the other comments here, I did not know that this film was a "prize" from that competition. I only turned the channels and found it, and found myself watching, daringly, until the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot (the most dangerous game, etc.) was performed but I was hoping, and I almost got, "I caught you" - how the protagonist would eventually win the hunter. I think the high-tech was overrated (GPS) and gave me cool memories of the Night Rider, but it was not overrated though. <br /> <br /> The main problem I encountered with this film was the degree of SOD (suspension of kufr) that was required of the viewer. Do we really believe that someone is flying a helicopter that can lose countless incendiary bombs at a public bridge and show no COPS for investigation? Could a limousine do innumerable cakes at the Las Vegas intersection and not appear COPS? Pleeease. Lots of this kind of stuff - fun watching, but keep it at least reasonable, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the finish was disappointing, with the taste beyond Star Trek's bad episode. Now at least I understand why the acting was cowardly - except for Zane, who does not approach the work that IMHO deserves - they were winners of a realistic program. <br /> <br /> Take me out.
