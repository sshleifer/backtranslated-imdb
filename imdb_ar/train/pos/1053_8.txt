"Sisters In Law" was created by the same fairly curious "divorce, Iranian style" directors, which was exactly the same, and we got a glimpse of the divorce court in Iran. They have now turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. The great thing about this court is that two judges are women, something unusual for such a country. However, they deal with many men who are used to getting around women, but this film is wonderful in the fact that it seems that women have made great strides in society, where divorce rights and women's rights have been recognized. So judges often chase men to behave in a primitive way at these times. So as not to say that women who appear before the court receive more lenient treatment. One of the main themes of the film is the abuse of children by the aunt. Judges do not waste time criticizing women. Who said that justice had not yet been achieved? With these two behind the bench. They often implement maximum penalties! Oh! Go girl!
