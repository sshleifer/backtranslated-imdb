Do not miss War Company for a sharply engraved satire or mental comedy filled with amateur jokes. it's not like that. <br /> <br /> This is an old comedy with a spiral shape, with ridiculously intriguing intrigues and stock characters (due to some depth in the entertainment performances of John Kozak, Joan Kozak, Marissa Tommy and Hilary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the political points of filmmakers are things the country knows almost entirely. Yes, we understand that the companies that benefit from the war are corrupt, that the inefficient pigs and the political leaders responsible for them are more interested than others, and that American imperialism has never seemed more enthusiastic and far from touching what it now looks like - but nothing from this point . <br /> <br /> Here, all this noise is the setting they make fun of - sometimes in ingenious ways - as the background to a ridiculous robbery, as John Kozak's character (the blow tries to save his heart to change his life with the help of a journalist he does not trust) The young Middle East who wants to cancel her marriage (Duff), Kozak's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with an almost enthusiastic quality, Lee Kingsley seems to be lost in the smaller part of him as a ruthless CIA director. It is a simple pleasure, but if you can not see the reality and believe that the war is going well and that everyone involved with it does a good job and there is no Sada and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to replace their cultures, which you may not find funny. <br /> <br /> For all of us, it was a light comedy with a political advantage.
