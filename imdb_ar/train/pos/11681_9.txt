Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this film say that this film was meaningless and the performance of Clara Boo. Although the story line was fairly typical of Clara's subsequent silence, I still find him somewhat enthusiastic and very enjoyable. Play Clara Happy Hawaiian Girl You will not stop at anything to win the man you love ... It does not matter that this man is married! Clara's lack of humility was awful today, but I think it sweetens the film. Although this film is certainly not a great story (actually typical), this film is a wonderful display of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
