Interestingly, Brosnan's most realistic performance is the performance of the original James Bond novels compared to bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a bootlegger. This is the perfect break for him, so make fun of the bond symbol. "I'm in a mess, a parody of myself." Do not get better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is what Ian Fleming's picture of James Bond is. Personally I never liked Brosnan as a Bond because it fits the icon closely. There was nothing personal to him, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It is wonderful to see Brosnan play a figure based on reality and strikingly of the wall. A shallow figure trying to reach an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues that he has no background to deal with. It's an impressive picture, and the presence of Greg Kenner on Earth, is just poetic. This film reminds me of the dynamics that have arisen among the main characters of My Blue Heaven, but more realistic in their coping mechanisms.
