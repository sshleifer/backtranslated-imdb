One of the top ten comedy movies ever <br /> <br /> This sounds like a very happy and light comedy sings. Comedy Keaton is - a literature, harmonious, intelligently arranged, thought. <br /> <br /> Amazingly entertaining, exhilarating and innovative, the three ages must belong to a draft of the top ten comedy if you draw one. A triple love story will attract viewers; do I want to bring this approach here? Comedy Keaton like DESTINY LAND upside down ?? Or B REBOURS. Once again, a couple crosses the waters of time and covenants in the Stone Age, in Rome, in Keaton in the country of Muhammadi, and in the Renaissance of Italy and China. The same device works in both films? One, dark, strange melodrama. - The other, light, brilliantly? In Keaton he is the same couple; perhaps he is the same with Lang. Babe wanted by both Buster and Berry nice. I found three generations written well and smart, without being sophisticated. The plot is basically POPEYE too? Like? Babe is a piece of furniture, the only heroes are two male foes? Keaton and Perry. <br /> <br /> The Keaton movie is very lovable, and may one be tempted to stress that this sounds like ambitious fun? But it is not, but it is great fun, great fun, great fun. Wallace Wallace Perry makes a good enemy.
