Must see! I saw the skin in a press show and it was our joy. We are talking laughing without stopping. They make something about Mary that looks like a curvy drama. Amanda Pitt screams at the quality of the stars through her exquisite combination of beauty, brains and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, has made an elaborate film that illustrates the first part of man's ego in urban dating. For all of this comedy, Whipped is successful. Which is very rare for the director for the first time, especially with romantic comedy. It is a great talent. Judah Dumke, Bryan Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zaurie Barber outperform their team with great depth and performance because they will be gentle gentlemen. You should see these young people go to work and join the Peet network. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth downloading for 3 minutes.
