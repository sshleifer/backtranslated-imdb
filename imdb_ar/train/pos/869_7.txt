Scout secretary Carla (Emmanuel Devos) is intimidated by her energetic male colleagues. <br /> <br /> When they suggest she needs an assistant, she looks like a final insult, but when the former applicant is Paul, Vincent takes the opportunity to change her life. <br /> <br /> Carla covers his mistakes and reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues. When Paul asks Carla to return the favor, she finds herself wounded in the criminal world of crime and is ruled by a single marchand shark (Olivier Gormet). <br /> <br /> In recognition of her ability to read hard as a weapon, no one will have negotiated it. The electorate is ready to achieve justice. <br /> <br /> The third feature of French director Jacques Audiard "Read My Lips" is a story that defies gender and transforms from dark social comedy to a full-fledged story.
