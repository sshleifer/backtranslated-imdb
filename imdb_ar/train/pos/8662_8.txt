I love this so much. In fact, if I saw him again (and I plan for him) he would love her. I will echo other reviewers in saying that this film really grows on you as you see. It starts somewhat slowly but the road in enfolds is very natural and has a mood. Just log in. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the film and I thought the film was very moving. The characters have a strong element of realism and film very slowly and weave a mantra as you engage in the different interactions between them all and want to know how it will end in the end and the paths that the characters will choose to follow. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that there are less than ten comments on this - there are mysterious TV movies containing more comments then Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I'll do. I've missed the end that drove me crazy and have to see it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be suitable for everyone, but I feel it has been grossly underestimated (even some of my most pure friends who have seen almost every film have not seen this movie) and it does not seem to be much of a message board but I loved it a lot and everyone who loves family dramas With stunning scenery, air and unexpected unforeseen speed, we must take a look at this. It's particularly noteworthy that it happens in South Carolina, so for those who like the South like me, the movies that happen there are a gem. I'll add my voice to a few annoying comments and recommend this unknown click.
