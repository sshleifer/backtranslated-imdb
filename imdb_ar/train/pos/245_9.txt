The only reason I wanted to see him was Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the film was amazingly average. This is not bad, but it really is not very good. Good editing film is a good paced. The trend is competent and guaranteed. The story trembles. The movie is played in average by Ledger, Bloom, Watts and Rush in the habit. Accents are indestructible If you are from the United States, just sit and enjoy the landscape (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I did not feel bored or move. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I must say that I have not yet taken this point. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only reason I recommend is that the type of Orlando Bloom shows some kind of hints in the run (although the present "I'm beautiful and confusing" looks prominent), so the fangs may find it worth the price. Otherwise, just do not see it. It's not good enough nor bad enough to be amusing.
