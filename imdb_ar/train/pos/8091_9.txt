The Peter Jackson version (films) are generally better films from an objective point of view. However, they are not my favorite versions of Lord Of The Rings, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the representation of the characters on the screen is very ordinary and uninspired with the LOTR of Jackson. The cast is all run from the mill. "Do you claim that those ridiculous cartoon characters from the Ralph Beckshi version are better actors than real people?" One can ask. Well, they are not really ridiculous (except for the Hobbits, later on them), and they certainly enjoy a more personal character than the Jackson party - even with very limited dialogue time. Due to the superior behavior of LOTR in Bakshi's. Take Aragorn for example. In this version his voice is deep and charming with full power (Lord Aragorn) and with a seasoned rasp (Aragorn Ranger). This is due to the great vocal representation of John Hurt. Compare this with a slightly high-pitched Viggo Mortensen voice, and the duel becomes flat quickly: Hurt beats Mortensen. <br /> <br /> Then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant personality (and most popular) in the full story. In this version Bakshi Gandalf (William Squire) is a real processor. I do not mean that he shoots the screws from his fingertips (he does not), but his presence is only captivating. He is a mystic, strong and can turn from a gentle old man into a scary person easily. Add to that his looks: tall, old oak, beard as long as his body, sharp eyes, charming nose, and of course the classic wizard's hat. Gandalf is perfect, as in books. Ian McKellen Gandalf on the other side, is just too boring. He looks very human, looks like a great man, is very humane, does not wear a hat, and does not have a sword. Yes sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf records a couple of bloody orcs killing his sword (as he did in the books). And that is a slow sluggish movement kills. Gandalf is not a force to be tampered with. It should be noted that while it saddens me to say this, the great Christopher Lee did not survive from Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr did this in the film, even with a time and very limited screen lines. <br /> <br /> Before moving fully to the visual aspects of the film, it must be pointed out that the vocal representation and the general display of the sprites are also superior to the reckless Jackson freaks. Orcs Bakshi mocked their enemies (or each other) constantly with roar, yelling and bad language. They are more believable as monsters and they are more faithful to the book in my opinion. Finally, the riders are black - or Nazgul. These ultimate villains are scary ghosts in this one - not just some cavalry dressed in black. They speak in a disapproving voice, which mesmerizes their victim. My favorite scene in the film is when the downfall of Frodo follows the river. While Peter Jackson could not do anything other than show the contestants who were chasing the ceremony, Bakshi casts in a nightmare dream with some slow motion scenes and a quiet sky. <br /> <br /> But I love this movie more than just Jackson, and the latter, technically, is still the best. This is because of some key images. As you know, Bakshi LOTR features a mix of animated characters (all hobbit and main crew) and real actors covered with paint. I have no problem really using real people in animation this way, but they do not fit well with traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true with humans (Riders of Rohan, Tavern people, etc.) Orcs are a different issue, because they aim to look very distinctive from other characters. Orcs, while played by humans with an animation mix, look much higher than the Jacksons version. They have a complex green complexion, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest screw in these movies, hoverver images, are Hobbits. Although I prefer almost every character in the Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has a distinct advantage over the hobbit, but it is actually perfect. With Bakshi, you'll get some unnatural and unnoticed Disney Disney dolls. You have to spend a lot of time with them, so be careful. Again, the vocal representation is fine with them too, but the mouths of the actors can not save the "immersion damage" caused by these small animals. Well, I never liked these scorers anyway. <br /> <br /> The general failures in the Bakshi text are well known. Limited playtime (limited budget) and lots of lost scenes. So, while this film covers almost half of the story, it does not do so in great detail compared to Jackson's. <br /> <br /> In short, the Ralph Baxi version of LOTR has a superior advantage: <br /> <br /> - the overall atmosphere (much like the middle ground) - overall vocal representation - music (I really dig the imaginary result By Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of John Hurt's most wonderful roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (which is not some fictional hippies in this one!) <br /> <br /> While the version Jackson is the best: <br /> <br /> - Because the whole story covers the visuals and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with known shortcomings , One of the best animated films ever produced, embodies Joe The world of Tolkien is fantastically well, if not quite. I'll give it a grade of 8 out of 10.
