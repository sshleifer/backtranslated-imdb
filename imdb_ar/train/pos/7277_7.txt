This is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the ancient Indian hokhum culture. She takes a mummy (looks really fake) from the burial cave and takes her home to study. Well, very soon, I began acting strangely and talking to this mummy. Soon after, her son became possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even strange events occur when the soul tries to destroy the family of women. This is actually really boring, in general, will make you fall asleep in the first couple of times trying to watch it. But if you continue, it may end. <br /> <br /> Aha! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the angry mummy spirit removed from the cave? You may not be able to confirm what the motive is for the spirit, but if you like scary geniuses with a low budget (and seventy hairstyles!) This will be a convenient attraction. <br /> <br /> The story is more vivid than the boring boring way in which the film depicts the story. Can the film really boring be fantastic? Well ... somehow this one achieves it. This film may have been good but was performed in a somewhat embarrassing way. I do not know, I do not know. What I know is that I enjoyed it a bit, despite his communication. <br /> <br /> Spider Baby fans are interested in knowing that a couple of the cues are used in this film. (Including an effective version of the featured song). <br /> <br /> There is one scary, good-performing series showing the excellent rocks and rocks that revolve around and eventually attack some people in the vehicle. Other scenes in the film are just spooky or quirky. But this scene is actually very scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It is strange and worth your time. You may even want one on your shelf.
