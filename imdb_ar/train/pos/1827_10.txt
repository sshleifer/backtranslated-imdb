All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I first saw her when I was three years old. Now I'm 12 years old and hired, makes me think about things and bring back a lot of memories, those were the "days". I love music, I love when Charlie arrives to paradise, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds can only play Charlie's voice this great. I love this movie, the first is the best because it is original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I can go back to those days. I love characters. If that's how memories come back when I'm 12, I can imagine how I'll feel when I'm 19, and I hope I can see it when I'm older. When I first saw this, I never knew I would actually look at him and feel that way, and I hope he will be available to watch. I am very happy that this film has been produced, and the amazing idea has started to take into account. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give it a great model 10. It's a great movie. It is very difficult to explain this feeling, when I get older and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
