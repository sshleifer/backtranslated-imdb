I always wanted David Duchovny to go to the cinema, and finally he did, and made me proud. This film lives up to what I was hoping for. Dushovny played his character very well and was able to maintain his consistency with something new, instead of playing the role of agent we used to. So, I give him credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to Timothy Hutton. Great performance does not tire him throughout the film, because it will never surprise you. He has weak points and strengths, making the story more believable. I enjoyed the story a lot, I added a lot to the story, and I had some memorable quotations that I still use all the time. This film was also wounderfull degree. I recommend this to anyone who loves drama and does not mind blood.
