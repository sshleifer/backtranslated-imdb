Oh, those deceptive Italians. This is not the first time that they have relied on a source material without permission or knowledge, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something that has traditionally been Italy but has been accomplished a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly due to their belief that they are often able to get rid of it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep the film out of the American screen until 1976, but the film itself has evolved into a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not great to watch the 1946 American film. But it's a wonderful film though. This, of course, is not at least because of the film. It's a great story, it's a thrilling story, and it provides some wonderful and realistic characters. It follows the novel very closely, and is therefore often similar to the other film versions of her story, although of course different in the Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians to make a film about life and the real people in it. This early drama is always characterized by a very realistic feeling, and therefore also involves watching it. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its strength in the end, when the film began to feel some overlap and pull the parts. The film could easily have ended 15 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> However, I have nothing else negative about this film. It is simply one made largely, based on some great source material and equally strong. Debut in the production of Luchino Visconti, where he continued to take out some great Italian dramas that are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> 8/10
