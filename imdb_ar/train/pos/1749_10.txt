Steve Carell presents himself to be a brilliant pioneer in this wonderful original breath and wonderful fresh air. I have been told about the extent of the hilarious genius. <br /> <br /> Basically, the title of the movie says it all: Andy Stitzer is 40 years old and works in an electronics store. He's an eccentric guy who loves video games and caricatures, and has the largest collection. His shop-mates discovered that he was Mary during a poker game full of gender dialogue, and then Andy had to go through a funny experience like hell Odyessy from an irrational sexual awakening, but always leads to a collision that does not lose his virginity, but eventually ends up Luck in the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the kids at home, but take the whole family to see this wonderful romantic comedy. You'll have to plug and crack from the start, and by the time you're finished, you'll wish to wear your heavy absorbent underwear. The only other thing I can say about this is very bad. Steve Carell was not known as a man who has been leaving for 20 years. He will certainly win the Best Performance Award at the upcoming MTV Awards. You can bet on the dollar you hard earned on it, folks! <br /> <br /> Give this one the perfect one!
