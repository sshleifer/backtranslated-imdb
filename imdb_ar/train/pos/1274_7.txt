Note that all who did not like this movie and enjoyed it commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differs from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books contain hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, the films take about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating many senses: visual and audio as well as fantasy. I do not care if the film is good, or indeed, like the book on which it is based. who cares? I judge what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. An old and many story, exposed to the ecclesiastical, could have been easily embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves pull him out. One of the reviewers found Riffen away from the old one. I never guessed she was forty years old when I made this film. Her role as an actress is that she played an enjoyable role between 23 and 24 years. I also think it's about the best thing Reeves did at all. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the screenplay has used "stress". However, it is worth watching; obviously it is not a strong love story; it is a charming love story that makes you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and overcomes evil. It is nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory word f # $% or bare buttocks or mutual kissing hours. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
