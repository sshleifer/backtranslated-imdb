This film is not just about shooting at school, it's actually never seen before. But this adds only to the power of this film. About people and how they deal with tragedy. I know it was shown to the students who survived the shooting incident in Colombine, and that gave a sense of closure for many of them. Great acting. All three major actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I highly recommend this film to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after seeing it. It is not only a debate about school shooting, but about human feelings and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a trivial game but it's worth it and I'll see it again and again
