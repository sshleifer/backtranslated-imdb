George Maxwell, the frustrated middle-aged prosecutor (a superb performance by George E. Carey, who produced this picture too), can no longer stand in front of his frozen wife Edith (Anne Ann Bellamy). Worse, poor George is so tired of the life of a newborn child and a teenage lesbian lesbian (Cherie Jackson's favorite brunette). George has a great shot with the sweet-assed baby-sitter Candy Wilson (who has fun with the intriguing rift by the witty blonde knocker Patricia Wymer). The complications arise when George finds himself smiling by the bitter Julia Freeman (a very bright turn by Cathy Williams), who wants George to end her close friend of motorcyclists Lawrence McKay (the terrifying Robert Tessier, who wears a head full of hair here) jailed. Director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McClarty captures the stunning story with a spectacularly overbearing surplus of delicious female nudity, stunning soft sex, and harsh violence. Moreover, they closely link the unbridled sense of youth culture in the sixties, linking the plot in a tight time of 75 minutes, thus ensuring that this film does not go beyond it. One of the highlights occurs when Kandy invites her kind friends to Maxwells' house to get a bash in the basement with an impromptu smoking pot, pulsating rock music and of course bare dancing chicks. The result of Robert O. Ragland is a funky hitting spot for Neri. The black and white film industry in Stanton Fox adds an added bonus to the joyful events. Best of all, this click is a wonderful display interface for Patricia Wheeler, a charming and completely fresh, who brightens the screen positively with her sweet personality and charming beauty. Total garbage treatment.
