Enjoy the film and crime drama Confucian efficiency, the old regime survives the threat of greedy man shouting, no doubt it represents modern society. I thought the last scene was strange and I could not understand whether we thought that Big D was punished because of greed or was part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and once in a Chinese film, violence was not a martial art festival. The thing I am always happy about about Hong Kong films is that the main influence that the British seem to have was the introduction of "Yes sir" and "sorry" in the local language and entertaining it long after we went, are still there.
