I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and looked at the TV and found the "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 minutes, but I was hooked. It was interesting and moving. This shows what can happen in anyone's life. Give it 10, more if possible. The director / writer and actors did a great job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and they will learn from it. It was a wonderful, play, puzzle, and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more films like this one. loved it! I did not even know about this film, which is sad because it was very good. I hope he goes in movies to see more people.
