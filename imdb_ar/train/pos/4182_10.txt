I have watched this Australian film for about 10 years and never forgot it. The film depicts the horror of war in a way Hollywood usually does. The relationship between the soldiers of the two belligerents is highlighted by the differences in culture and the final knowledge that in the end we are not all different at home. If you can find any kind of copy of this - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just a drawback.
