While the film seems to be long at times, it is worth it. Gordon draws a style that reminds you of the patterns of writing in Vonneguts. Merciless, thoughtful, naive, strange, and dark, this film will stay with you for a long time, begging for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman, and Arkin are all amazing. Cheryl Lee is also wonderful, in a role reminiscent of Lynch lovers Laura / Mady days. Do not miss this!
