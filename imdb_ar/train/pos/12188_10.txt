The genius of Pure Orson Welles makes this one of the greatest films. Wales is drawn to a murder plot just to be prepared as a fall man, which is referred to by the cynical comment "Big Doll I" The plot is so complex that I do not know if the victim knows that his life is about to be lost. An exchange of fire in the Carnival Mirror Hall is one of the finest scenes ever shot. This scene alone deserves the price of admission. This is the only time Rita Hayworth plays a complex and sensible character. No one but the welts of the nerve to cut her hair and dye it with copper blond. No one should miss this picture.
