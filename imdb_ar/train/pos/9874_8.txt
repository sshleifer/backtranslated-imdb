In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is not ready for the big time of the man whom Van Hevelin loves. The film was certainly a big change for Mr. Hevelin, especially after winning the Oscar last year in Johnny Eger. <br /> <br /> Spring Bayington was no bigger than the mother of a widow with five children, with four of them appearing as grandchildren? <br /> <br /> The singing and dancing are superbly organized, but the way in which the flowering romanticism between Hevelin and Garland has left much to be desired. It was like Gigi where a charming girl eventually swept into a charming girl.
