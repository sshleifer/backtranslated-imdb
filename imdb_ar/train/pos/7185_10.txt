As he sat on the front porch of his Burbank house, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in every piece of clothing except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest men of the game, said that every time Zoro puts his mask on, he is the one who appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was somewhat exaggerated: there were times when Zoro was clearly Red Hadley, but in stunts we could be satisfied that Ted was at work. <br /> <br /> What a thriller! Zorro's Fighting Legion, as seen here, is one of the greatest serials. It's exciting and made very well. <br /> <br /> Red Hadley was a good actor, and as someone else commented, he did a very good job. <br /> <br /> But, admittedly, it's the procedure that made this movie so great. <br /> <br /> And what can we expect, too, under the guidance of this distinguished team, Whitney and English, with impressive music from the impressively impressive William Lava (the list here) says he was not accredited, but this is not true; the other authors The list here is not really qualified, and I do not know if they have written any of the music - it looks like Lava), and with the wicked of, among others, great Charles King, with parts of small parts? <br /> <br /> It was also worth noting that it was evil by Tarzan Radio, Jim Pierce, the son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini-biography). <br /> <br /> There is one chapter that slows down depression, but it only takes a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you walk around, well, I've come back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves great thanks for making this excellent show, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> We have to thank all concerned that we see it as a quarterly play, or a series, not as a retraction feature.
