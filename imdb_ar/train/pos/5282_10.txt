I do not know ... maybe it was just an impressive tribute to some Islamic religious works (Hajj) but I felt the film was too low. I can not believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far and has been produced in 2004 and has won many awards ever since. movies.Reda, a French teenager scheduled to take part in the baccalaureate, asks his devout old father to take him to Mecca. Strange because it may seem (if he does not know much about Islam) that the father wants his son to lead them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia in a one-time religious journey. The generational gap between father and son is based on simple enough terms ("You may know how to read and write, but you know nothing about life," the father whose name was not revealed to his son). But they are passionate in their frustrations. Father never speaks French although Reza understands Arabic but can seem to answer in French only. Even though they met many people on the road: "There is the terrifying old woman she picks up on the Bosnian border on her way to Belgrade, and the Jacky Nercessian, who help them on the Turkish border, shy women wearing a burqa on their way to Damascus" Always on father and son are not identical. There is not much talking in the film which makes it fun for your eyes. You see great views in every city they go to. The director shows you up to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia although the film is not relatively long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not like the movies you do not like enough dialogues that draw their strength from the fine details of the camera but that was very impressive. Although some details have not been answered (such as Reda's unseen French girlfriend), the film appeals to sentiment. Great artwork and remember that this film is the debut of Ismael Froukhi.
