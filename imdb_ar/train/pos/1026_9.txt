I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These presentations supported the potential offer of regular actors and actors. Replacing the RDA in seasons 9-10 was sufficient to remove the heart from the supply. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the major characters is enormous. Feel that actors prefer to turn around after the camera stops turning. This relationship moves to the program we recognize. <br /> <br /> The RDA grants its own O'Neill character. He never knows when wisdom gives him rest. You see others rolling their eyes in fear of some of his words. However, they know that he is the man he is in when the situation is precarious. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on between Carter and O'Neill under the surface. They managed to keep the lid, but often barely. The episode "Solitudes" in the first season got some of the best drama seen on television. Love between the two made the possibility of death possible because they faced them together. <br /> <br /> Carter and Jackson often have to relieve some of the turmoil created by O'Neal. But O'Neill's tactical instincts always sound intact. He understands what needs to be done without having to think about it. The team was repeatedly threatened by others who did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> Quality has dropped markedly in Chapters 9 and 10. The original story arc has mostly been used, and the new villains have never really caught my attention. Ben Broder was far inferior to the RDA in the show load. He had rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda listened to her performance during these two seasons. You can see her changing her appearance after birth. She probably was thinking about the baby more than the show. <br /> <br /> The separate "Stargate Atlantis" has a few moments, but is often a weaker effort. The main characters lacked the chemistry of the original cast. The bad guys are so unlikely to be ridiculous. Amanda Tapping may be able to broadcast some life in the program or it will not last until the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There was always a problem for me in the special effects of this show. The shape of pyramids in the form of pyramids is rarely equal to design in science fiction. The use of torches for lighting in these ships is equally bad. The use of decoration from ancient Egypt to hide the very modern technology is difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> I wondered about some continuity in the show as well. In the opening game of the second season, Daniel Jackson was shot and his clothes were a big hole where he was injured. He crawls into the coffin as he heals his body and restores it as if he had just stepped out of the carrier in the wardrobe. The "Hathor" ring contains a coffin in the hands of the SGC board, yet is not mentioned again. This device could have been used in several subsequent episodes on Daniel, O'Neill and Dr. Fraser.
