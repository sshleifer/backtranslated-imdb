An unforgettable masterpiece by The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a sweet and bitter animation. I remember this very well since my childhood, it was funny, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a bit dark, the dog who survived the pound, is killed by an old friend, and ends up in paradise, back. But he becomes dissolved when he authenticates an orphan girl who can speak to animals. Some scenes were a little scary, unlike other cartoons, like Charlie's Dream series, but everything else was fine, and the songs were fair. An unforgettable role for Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love this guy, ahehehe. Judith Percy from the vengeful wrath, God has mercy on her soul, poor girl, was not worthy of death, but in Paradise now, all good people go to heaven. Overall this is a very good animated film, classic without bloth enough to put anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for all family members. Knowing this, if you have the original video for this, you will find after the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important message especially, it has love for that man.
