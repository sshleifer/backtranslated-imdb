When I saw the film, I was really shocked to see what happened in the 1960s. I know I might be wrong about some things, but the 1960s seemed to have a real impact on people at the time. Some people said they wanted to go back to the 1960s. From what I saw I would say yes to excitement and not to the result. But that's my opinion.
