I finally sat and watched this movie all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my favorite new actresses - not only can she act, but she chooses the roles that are most appropriate to her and which are more important and important than she seems to be. I read some of the comments in which she expressed satisfaction that this was not something terrible, as they had thought before, but I certainly do not agree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself as opposed to what almost everyone around her (except for her brother Tiny, her coach and manager, Hector, who proves to be a father figure more than her real father), is what "feminism" is all about. It's good to see films like this showing the true side of the women's movement - they are not a group of losers - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is honest with herself while still falling prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complex relationship rather than just a magic thing. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and has restored some faith to my perception of people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that can be linked not only to young women, but to anyone who wants to go far in their lives.
