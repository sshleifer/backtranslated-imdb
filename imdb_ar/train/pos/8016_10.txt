Do not think of these films as another movie for children - the whole family can enjoy. It's a strange mix of film, it seems to contain a movie inside it, but at least it seems logical at the end (unlike modern films!) All the elements of the film (good plot, good characters - well, starring Muppets, What is surprising is the fact that it can be a coaster of emotions, some sad, some grainy, some funny and some dangerous - everyone makes a fun family movie that everyone can see together. <br /> <br /> * The film's celebrities are really top stars, but there is only one real star in the film and no one dares to outdo Miss Piggy !!!!
