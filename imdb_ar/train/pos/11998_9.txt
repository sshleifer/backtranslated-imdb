This film was beautiful. It was full of memorable pictures, good disposition, and touching the subject. It will be very easy to write off it as very emotional, but these are the emotions that this genre of film tries to achieve. I was fully engaged in the story and presented. There were a few cheesy shots, but this is expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can invoke is that there were not many details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, his ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc.; it was designed to take a quick look at some of the highlights of one of the most exciting American and historical religious figures of all time.
