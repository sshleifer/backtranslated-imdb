The soldier is not a great film, and everyone who hates him has a lot of good reasons. But I loved the soldier a lot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the technical direction is tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backgrounds go, the soldier would do things with more design then 90% of that kind. The collections, costumes and props were all consistent and efficient; I did not like all their military style in the future, but I was impressed by this effort. For me, making this movie worth the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of my most memorable youth films ... Barefoot Executive and his films John Carpenter. Soldier is basically a motion film, and the role of sergeant Todd is the main movement hero. It is not an award-winning role, but Kurt summons a convincing sentiment in the small VERY dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, combat scenes and battles are well designed. This is not a ferrous monkey, or even a matrix, but again, far exceeds the average quality level of this type. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it and want science fiction action movies, pick it up if you pass in the lease warehouse of your choice. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
