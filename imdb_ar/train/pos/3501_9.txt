One of the best movies I've seen in the past five years! The stunningly spectacular cast in the story of acne and Bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with two leads to be stars. It's a funny, charming, sad and inspirational game. It's a refreshingly refreshing idea of ​​the urban youth who often put Larry Clarke in the bottom of his mind. He is ... angry, although I have to admit that Bully was more than his usual price. Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that will fail ... Do not miss it!
