/ The first episode I saw in Lost made me think, What are some of those people who crashed and were chased by a giant monster. But it is not, it is much more, because it is not a monster at all and every episode of Lost, but it improves every time. An abandoned island with an underground hideout and especially the relationship between people who crossed the roads with each other before crashing. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> Control this series and I can not wait to see what is really going on there and I hope they do not broadcast the last episodes in the theaters, this series deserves 9 out of 10
