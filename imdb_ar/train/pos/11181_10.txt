This is one of the most horrifying, most horrifying, horror movies ever! <br /> <br /> Dr. Kreid (Louise) and his family move to a new home with his wife Rachel and his daughter Eli and his little son Gage. Everything looks natural until Dr. Kred loses his patient, By stealth knows as Victor moves to Pet Sematarty and shows him that where the dead comes into life. <br /> <br /> Lewis does not know if all this dream was talking to Ellie, who is worried about her cat and that the truck can then kill Rachel later, telling Lewis that it's really hard to talk about death because of her sister Zelda was really ill (as we see in the flashback how sick her sister was already one of the coolest scenes ever!) <br /> <br /> The next day, Lewis received a phone call from Jed saying that a cat there had been killed by Truck and Jade took him to the place where Victor told the Ghost not to go! The cat was buried, his wife and his children went to see their ancestors and Louise alone was shocked to see the cat come back and now evil in her eyes until he goes to see Jed then Jed tells him that he buried a dog there too (as we saw the flashback back). <br /> <br /> Later in the film The Family out Picnic, Gage plays a kite and Gage says he drops it. "The wind blows on a rod near the road where a truck comes in the fast past. Gage approaches the road. , The most broken scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on the ground or the Shivers will drop your back when you hear the scream of Louis shortly after Louis lost it, and then Gage is buried in the same place where the cat was buried. > The most frightening thing about this film is that some of the scenes in this film are not far from life really. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing and the representation from everyone was great! 10 out of 10
