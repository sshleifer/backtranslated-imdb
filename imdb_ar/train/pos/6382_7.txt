Definitely a very good idea, the script was good. It would have been better to be better, the pros are you do not carry you if you are an adventurous enthusiast, a new idea of ​​Atlantis lost world. That this idea had much more potential. It should have ended with a better adventure. It was not bad at all, but it would have been much better with some extra runtime. Say it was boring or not good ... a good idea for people who like animation of adventures like Sinbad, like the road to Eldorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very happy ending.
