While Alan Rudolph's "Heroes Breakfast" slides into the theaters without much fuss and much irony, I think of 1996 when Keith Gordon's "The Mother of the Night" came out. Now, despite Kurt Fonygout's words as "unclear", it is surprising that he has received two wonderful cinematic treatments (the other is "The Five Slaughterhouse"). "Mother's Night" is definitely one of the most esteemed films in the decade and I can not understand why. It's a great! He remains almost completely faithful to the book Vonnegut (without riding or understanding literature excessively) and adds a purely cinematic poem to him. How many cinematic adaptations to the works of any author can claim to be? Vonnegut himself put a great look at the end of the film, and can you ask for better endorsement? It is not only a beautiful film but a beautiful, written and directed film, one of the films I chose for the best five American films or so in the 1990s. It is a surreal masterpiece that is sad and unworthy of negligence. I would honestly encourage anyone to see the "mother of the mother" - so they do not need to know Vonnegut's work to appreciate it completely (just like the "slaughterhouse five" sometimes). It's a powerful piece that affects cinema.
