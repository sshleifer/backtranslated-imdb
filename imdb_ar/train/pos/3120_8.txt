Paul Greengrass certainly saved the best Bourne to another! I've heard a lot of people complain about their way of filming this film, and some have compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I want to say is ... Are you kidding me? Come on it was not bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, and you prefer to design the very elegant dances. As for the rest of the film, I did not really notice it. <br /> <br /> You can tell that Damon has already relaxed the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case, it is really good. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon has a great support team in Joan Allen, Ezra Cramer and Julia Steeles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, adding more depth to the secret CIA. <br /> <br /> Although the film is full of wonderful car chases and nonstop movement, they have been able to commit to a fair amount of personal development in all that is going on. This film stands much higher than other Bourne films, which is definitely one of the best films in the 2007 summer season!
