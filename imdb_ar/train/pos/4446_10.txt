Yes, I call this film ideal. Not a boring one again, a wonderful collection of actors and actors, mostly unknown, a large group of well-defined characters with understandable motives that I can sympathize with, perfect lighting, black and white photography, appropriate soundtrack design, It is one of those high-quality images that must be grounded in all the pride of Hollywood, a sign that everyone must strive to reach. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply amazing. There was nothing the actress could not do, and she was always easy on the melodic side. Do not be surprised hysterical with this lady - I always thought she was the best actress of the screen goddess such as Beth Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always tough as nails and at the same time convey true feelings. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this part is the least interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie fits this film well. It is about human desires and desires that I think everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to be planning on this film, all the characters act motivated, and everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact is that this often leads to complications that make the dramatic content I will not go here. <br /> <br /> I like what this film says about youth and maturity and the need for compromise. The film that is most closely associated with this film is Alfred Hitchcock's film The Shadow of Doubt, which creates a similar atmosphere of idealism and at the same time is filmed in A Small Town in America. The story has a similarity to Fritz Lang's most strenuous film, Clash by Night, which was produced a year ago, where Stanywck starred in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
