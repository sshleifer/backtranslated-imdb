I saw that I saw some of the "Speed ​​Racer", but I never saw them, and I also saw other shows, some showing these characters wearing birds, a ship called Phoenix and another orbiting a space ship resembling the giant ocean ship and flew back sometimes for some reason. Really and hard to understand for someone who may have been five years old. This although I watched almost every episode and the amazing for me at the time was that this show had some precision in it. It's really over, the bad guys have done unlike almost every American cartoon where nothing really ends up like the last episode of the generation that the Galvatron Transformers finished and this new bad guy vows to get Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never make it at home, with GI Joe with Cobra is still ready to try again and so on and so forth. The program was over and a fairly great robot appeared, getting new weapons as the show progressed. It was very simple because it could not fly and had only a few really wonderful weapons. With his lead, he got a great shooting grip like the Android 16 used against Cell in the Dragonball Z, and then developed the weapon to include the razor blades that were launched. Then the big robot got on wings so he could fly and merge more weapons into the wings. He will also get two allies in robotics and a somewhat funny man called Bobo in America. The bad guys are not only composed of Dr. Hill, but a really strange man was a half-man half-woman and dandy with his flying head. The presentation was interesting and had a kind of nice finale seeing.
