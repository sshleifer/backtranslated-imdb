I watched this movie for the first time in about 4 years and I was expecting something funny, similar to CB4. I was blown away. I was on the ground laughing butt off this movie is very great. Better than CB4, characters, songs, plot, everything. The best independent film has been awarded the "Thumbs UP" award by Siskel and Egbert (and if two young white people can understand the humor in this click, you know it is good).
