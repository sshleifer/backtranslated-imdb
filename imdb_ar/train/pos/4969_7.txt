It is great to see that Chen Meadows is already exercising international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT is involved with many topics with ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the mysterious class identity above work but below the middle level, the unbroken father, the abandoned urban environment, the adult feeling of failure, Fascism barely concealed the underpinnings of modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an official expert, Mariage circulates in the pictures, and his brilliantly shaped monochromatic frames and brilliant surrealism remove the darker and darker subject, which, like Meadows, deviates from a farce High for tragedy within seconds. <br /> <br /> There are passersby and clich√©s, but Boylvordi Magnus, an ordinary man with normal ambitions, tries to get them serious. While individual groups - popcorn explosions / pidgeon. The best marriage sequence since the dead and the dead - managed to snatch the epiphany from despair.
