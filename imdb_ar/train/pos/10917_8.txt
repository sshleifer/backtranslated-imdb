I've just been able to get a contract from Heavenly Region 3 DVD from The Five Venoms and what a great job they made of it. A wonderful transfer has been digitally reprinted and must be for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty straight forward, already mentioned so I will not go back to it. Needless to say, they are scenes of combat bought by many of the film, and do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a little bit disparate and seem to have been tested. Bruce Lee can take that amount and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the kicks and punches come with all the clicks of the "writing writer" task and the air "whooshes", a wonderful effect despite being very amusing! <br /> <br /> I give this movie B +. Good but not great. In a way I feel it could have been a little better. Golden Suallo, the same director a decade ago, had a good story and a better job.
