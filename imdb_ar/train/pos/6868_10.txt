I saw this in Detroit as it should have been its original course. I literally entered the theater corridor. It was funny. I have not seen it since, but I love it. Where to get a copy? Anyone who says anything about it is dated or overpriced, for my money, just a bunch of poseurs. Every play is comic either evil or exciting or hazy. Everyone! There is one weak listed. The opening sequence, for example, which parody of 2001, features gorillas with gorgeous breasts. If I came to this film with an open mind and a bright heart, you would put it on your best list.
