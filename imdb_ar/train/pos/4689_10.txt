I wholeheartedly agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and useful films I have ever seen. As mentioned before, I remember I started watching, I think it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was very wrong. The story of the colony was not only spectacular, but I remember music as a big part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, Native Americn pipes (closer to the music at the end of One Fly Over the Cookoo's Nest). I'm also looking for a copy. This must be required to see anyone, but private schools. Must be reissued.
