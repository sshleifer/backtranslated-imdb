I saw this movie for the first time when I turned the movie channels on my parents DirecTV. It was on Sundance Channel and just started. I love music, especially in the late 1960s and that's what BJM looked like (the Dandys are fine). Everything about the Johnstonstown Massacre caught my attention from music, to the characters Anton and Joel, to illegal drug abuse. It was fun because I was watching the first scene of the party when everyone was making lines that my father would follow and watch (their faces were priceless). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it brought me to the Brian Johnstown massacre which now became my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> Just watch it ... seriously
