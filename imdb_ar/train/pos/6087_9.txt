I saw this movie in the first two weeks it was over, (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was fine, for Ben Stiller. This film is not for a person without a sense of humor. Like most Ben Stiller jokes, you have to think about them. Or as you said you have a good sense of humor. From two people on this site, I saw that people did not have anything good to say about it and did not get a very good rating, but I was going to give it a bigger film, I think this movie should have gotten a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I just give you someone else's opinion.
