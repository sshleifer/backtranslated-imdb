What is this film is the sharp political commentary of the emergence of the story of a new era. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. He is not supposed to do but he does. The tale of four boys and a girl born in 1953 Belgrade communist is warmer in the heart. This is what gentlemen call classical cinema. It is clear that Belgrade 1953 is not a dictatorial and brutal reality, as is the case with communist society. One can listen to rock and roll, one of the songs that is playing is the song "Hey Babu Riba" on the movie title. But you can not buy jeans or some illegal drugs to own them. Contrary to the harsh criticism of the communist society, this film shows how it affects the lives of the five heroes who refer to themselves as four. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for her mother's passport as she travels abroad to join him, the piano that was extracted from the company's use of one of the boys, sudden tender to your home and neighborhoods to your new comrades because they need it. Children spend a lot of time listening to music, and they seem to despise the fascism created by Communism when they engage in a fight with a fascist witch Stalin has tattooed on his hands. All this leads to their subsequent actions and recalls the time that fades, as this film was shown in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet empire. A wonderful movie worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not an enemy, but it is also a friend of one."
