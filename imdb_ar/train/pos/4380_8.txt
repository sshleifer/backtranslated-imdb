This is an action / drama / very good movie, rated well below classification. <br /> <br /> The main story is that Rob Roy borrowed Â£ 1000, stole it, and caused problems for his family indirectly. His family. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an evil and amazing figure in this story. Coolly brutal and if you see his face, he seems to be able to turn off his eyes and look completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Nison) is very excellent, but I think the writers used the word "honor" 1 many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are strong, and the entire film is well represented and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword is very realistic, but not too very. The story is good and you really want to win Rob. <br /> <br /> All in all shy of classics.
