Every time this film is shown on the BBC someone in Radio Times says how it satire against the postwar world of rationing and welfare state. I do not think this is the goal of the film at all. The film is made fun of spivs and female housewives who campaigned against government restrictions but were a Conservative front organization. <br /> <br /> Yes of course, the film sends social / social policy situation, but in the end people realize they need all the controls to ensure a just society, they want to be British and fight instead of foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they're going back to being exactly like they were before.
