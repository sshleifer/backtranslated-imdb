This show has a wonderful story! It is very reasonable! A man's wife dies and can not take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother his best friend and many others come later in the show. Such as Rebeecca Donaldson, the powerful comet dog, Comet, Nikki and Alex who you can discover yourself (I do not want to spoil it for you) and force Kimmy Gibler! (DJ Sidekick) but the children are very wonderful. This is Mary Kate and Ashley took off for the first time! You may also know Candace Cameron Bure from programs such as St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and this is very crow! Judy Sweeten plays Steve in the love of an average child who feels abandoned. Really this is a very good show!
