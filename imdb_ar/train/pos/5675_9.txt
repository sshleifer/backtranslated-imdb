Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have never heard of - essentially have the same principles as the second and fourth principles and have nothing revolutionary in them. But it is still fascinating - Duke of fiery Wellington and fat fool Dr. Johnson (first dictionary author in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There is still more than one hilarious ointment to be delivered in this series, which highlights humor in a less famous era - in precise and enjoyable historical episodes. Picnic Blackadder III is not the most famous and most famous in the game, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as the servant of a stupid prince is funny and effectively executed, and Hugh Laurie at his best in the series. very good! 9/10
