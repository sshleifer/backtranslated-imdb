"Written on the Wind" was a very successful global image. This can only be done by Douglas Cirque, the man who saw the possibilities in the article given to him. Based on a well-known novel by Robert Wilder and the participation of George Zuckerman, it included all the elements that make excellent melodrama: sexual lust, a great wealth of oil, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Cirque put the way for later to follow in the genre of operatic serials, especially "Dallas" and "Dynasty", only to mention two. <br /> <br /> The truth is that this movie was filmed entirely within the studio. Most of the decor is false. Like many of those photographs in the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was filmed entirely in a studio set. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to occur in Manhattan, or Miami, or even the lake, one can see how the landscape is painted wallpaper. Sirk was not as interested in realism as long as he could tell the story in his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently discovered a show, part of Mr. Cirque's revival, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially in the scenes of Rock Hudson, who plays good Mitch Wayne. There is also something of a drawing in the way that Robert Keith, who plays the role of Patriarch Jasper Hadley, and then on his evil daughter Marley, Derek oil adorning the office of the older man, adores a kind of archaeological artifact. . <br /> <br /> Douglas Cirque is likely to want his team to perform best, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone depicts the rumors of Marley and, to a certain extent, Robert Stack, who acts as Kyle, the tormented heir of the story. This may be the easy explanation for what appears across the screen. The only person who looks natural is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to make her character "Lucy Moore" look like a mere founder who was caught with the wrong audience. <br /> <br /> Along with other Hollywood films "Written on the Wind" features the genius of the talented director who gave the audience what they wanted to see: larger stories of life can only be seen on the big screen
