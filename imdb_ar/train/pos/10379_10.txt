Play Plato is an amusing b movie with Gary Busey.it is a somewhat unknown film so the one I saw in the boot car I thought this sounded amusing you were right. Gary Posey Plato Smith Plays the Assassination of Plato. The Plato, who is now in the long run, must remain alive enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends Steve Bauer and the action star Jeff Spexman. What I liked about Plato's show was the way in which the film did not tire of a plot being made before, but it was still good that the acting was fun to watch and the procedure was very enjoyable, especially since Gary Bossi makes a good hero of irony. Because he usually plays bad guy and Steve Bauer well in Plato's friends, even Jeff Spiksman performs well and he can not act well to finish Plato's operation is a fun effort from the new picture films and give him 7 out of 10
