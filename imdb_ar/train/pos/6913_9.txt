As a community theater actor who works very hard but does not act very seriously, I am always happy by those who treat her as a great shroud. This film distorts "Actor Craft" mercilessly while laughing a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> The representative of the pork is on the scene of the movie What the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack due to a lot of drink and food, the actor is abducted and forced to play "part of the age" by the head of the new Nazi intelligence service. He plays it to the limit, gets the friend of the dictator to fall in love and vice versa, and runs the tables on his captors beautifully. <br /> <br /> Lots of wonderful attractive things from potential customers, lots of good work by some anonymous supporting actors, especially family members and two palace guards, and lots of little entertainers. Sammy Davis Jr. highlights himself, Jonathan Winters plays the role of a semi-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfus is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film, but it contains many beautiful sites (in Brazil), a comic text, and good actors doing their work and they seem to enjoy themselves and do not get into the usual existential concern about what acting is!
