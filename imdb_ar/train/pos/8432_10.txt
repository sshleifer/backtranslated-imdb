I did not read anything about the film before watching it, by chance, last Saturday night. Then, while I was watching, I felt the misery of Lena and Bisman in my bones. I was so impressed by acting, tone and photography that I listened in part to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed and I was asleep, under the influence of the film. I wanted to wake him up just to say, "If I ever vote for Oscar, it will be up to those actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the film on IMDb, and I was saddened to know that Mr. Perry died before the film was released and that it was probably unprecedented in the latest version of the masterpiece. I still want to tell him that his film was for me a real independent film in his sense and spirit. The actors must be praised not only for their wonderful performance but also for accepting them as a part of which no one glows, does not appear, but on the contrary, showing the true picture of human depression. Sad but impressive.
