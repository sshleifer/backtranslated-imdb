I feel very sorry for people who go to movies using a painting and a pencil to write defects and keep observations about how bad the film is. I feel the same contempt for people who go to movies and can not suspend the reality and / or allow themselves to enjoy 90 minutes away from their boring or crowded life! GET GRIP PEOPLE. ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, this is not for you. If you expect the film to resemble the book in any way, it is not for you. But if you enjoy the horrifying Queen of the Queen of Priscilla, or "What I Watch the Hell" by Moulin Rouge. Or a stark comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" and then let yourself escape to the Cowboys. It has some really funny parts. Really hilarious. It also has some really good music; glory to kd.lang. I also mentioned that it has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... I need to say more
