Pierce Brosnan captured the last Martini and returned, in a parody of the scandal, as the brilliant assassin killer, Julianne Noble, who has a special passion for teenage girls, bullfighting and ready-made clothes. During his work in Mexico City, he met Danny (Gregg Kenner), a Denver-faced suburban businessman who is in the city to complete his life at the hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and the blunt and blunt comments of Julien, they become friends. <br /> <br /> The director Richard Sheppard largely revealed by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kenner that he did not write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can not imagine it without him. He has proven that he has a real talent in comedy and can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene where the two meet in the hotel's bright bar (amazing collections and beautifully photographed) is really part of the acting skills. The scene lasts about 15 minutes, and although it has been carefully written, the actors are very weary, but they have done well! It looks like a new standard in screen representation. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in the MEE STEETS program, wearing and adding one of the most accurate bases for many cliche cliches and portrayals of special actors (James Bond Poznan in particular), and one of Hollywood's most popular peers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is wearing a short while later. An hour later, the film runs out. However, I can not put my finger on it exactly, I've enjoyed this much. It is a very new and innovative feeling, with some innovative use of lighting collections, and some hints to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not given much to do, but this film offers something new, in this regard, succeeds almost effortlessly in blending all traditional types into an amusing parody. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
