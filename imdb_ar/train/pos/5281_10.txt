This is not "Bonnie and Clyde" or "Thelma and Louise" but it's a great movie. It prepares two main characters gently and easily. Viewers learn the inherent tensions quickly, a tribute to the director. There is a French-speaking (and English) son who wants to achieve good results in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks wine, as young people do. His father speaks Arabic (and French), which faithfully follows his faith in Islam, with the generosity and wisdom of the elderly and rejects the new culture surrounding him (such as mobile phones). The film can explore very strong policies - the strange couple are leading the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then to the Middle East to reach Mecca. These are areas where Muslims have participated in wars, repression and ethnic cleansing; dictators practice torture and summary executions to keep power, and religious communities engage in a deadly battle with one another. After the film moves through those places and possibilities with only hints of these agendas. The relationship between the two is the key to this film, faith, and politics are the background. We seem to say that we are all human, and we need to understand each other and take care of them for good governance in this world. They are certainly not "natural born killers" and all the better for her.
