Let me start by saying at the age of thirty-four I was suddenly a widow. He destroyed me because he was not sick. He died unexpectedly mainly as a result of the Coronary Artery. The carotides exploded and died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation by the police, because he signed something and bumped his head. I was suspected of murder until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as shocked as I was, so I loved the good father's personality as it was. I had three young children, no education, no financial support. I took him very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my husband attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I do not grieve in front of the children. I wear masks and show people what they wanted to see. I did not show them my pain during the holidays ... No one stood in front of me, Except of course, the grief wizard I saw and who advised me to follow my heart and soul. My husband did not understand it! My relationship with them has changed forever, and I have not come back for a holiday. This is just one example of how to respect my sadness! My (new) husband saw me collapse and I was talking about the shock when I shared my soul. I can not breathe, or overheat, and generally I can not access it for several days even if I try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul is turned upside down, my heart is broken. My fears and the Germans have come back from the real demons that this film presents; how sad one compares to the way others and demons expect us to be. Pictures of Adam Sandler completely suffer the terrible suffering you face, overcome them, and most of all, work in your time! This film has washed away all the pain I have experienced over the years. As you can see, when something hurts your spirit so deeply that words come from your mouth in moments of thought, you can not deal with it without wishing you to die and walk in life, in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The Bible contains a holy book, Romans 8:26, which I cling to, when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, that the Holy Spirit of God holds those pains on the feet of God - talk. Sandler photographed it to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was transferred to a court hearing, for purposes of mental health, and to confront his son-in-law (familiar to me) --- and tell them the amazing facts he himself possesses Can not be finished. It is a strong and deep performance. I started to laugh and faced difficult times after the wings woke up from the stage, and my legs felt weaker than I did. My son was with me and saw it with my own eyes, my delicate movements as he tried to prove all that together; a lesson for him, a little boy who barely remembered his father. It has been 13 years for me, but this film brought me back to the moment my husband's family lost forever when they asked for a mask for my feelings and their surrender to their wishes, rather than respect for my country. <br /> <br /> Write this down, even if you're a fan, you're ready for this film, but I highly recommend Sandler's performance. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet upset, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their sorrows, and let them find peace in their own time! Sometimes, the soul can not utter words to express our pain. <br /> <br /> Go to watch this movie with tissue and not be prepared ... for your soul!
