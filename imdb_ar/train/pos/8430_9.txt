It's always nice to see Angela Bassett play a role that can sink her teeth into it. She is sometimes very intense, funny and playful in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman forced to build a house on a deserted mudbank outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at role not entirely sympathetic as her partner, Basman. Willie Jonah offers a subtle performance as a stranger discovering the living area of ​​Boesman and the new Lena. You do not often get a chance to watch a smart movie dealing with mature themes. Although it is based on a play, the late director John Perry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by filming the film in the widescreen Cinemascope format. It also keeps things visually enjoyable by blocking creative actors and showing only the things mentioned in the play. Just like Diane Carroll in Claudine, John Perry may have directed Angela Bassett to an Oscar nomination. It's definitely a movie worth looking for.
