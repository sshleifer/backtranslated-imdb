I dealt with the Cracker Bag show last night before showing a preview of Disney's holes. I do not know who decided to offer it, but I am very happy with what they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early eighties of the last century as seen through the child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother Farhana, as with the rest of the film, were very faithful to life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia to the past because it reminded me of my childhood (since I am about the same age as the director who might help him a bit) and the sound doubles the feeling. I just hope to get the Cracker Bag back someday.
