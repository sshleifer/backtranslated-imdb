The issue of the 1985 version of this film is simple; Indiana Jones is closely designed along the lines of Alan Quartermain (or at least the character of Alan Quartermain TYPE), so much so that the director of '85 made the mistake of looting IJ films for dialogue and story deeply. What I got as a final product was a mixed mess of the name of Alan Quartman, in the uneven Dodge of the cheap IJ Epic Tradition (with a touch of cheese Austin Powers - here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics have described it as a "big spoof" or "unintended comedy". Intended is the word. The film was not meant to be funny; clever, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, she is unskilled and not ingenious. <br /> <br /> With this new mini-series from M4TV, you can get more stories and personal development to see you, your solid pictures and a wonderful, fun and enjoyable mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but well deserved since this version carries a true story and not just action and candy candy. Although it contains both Action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting all IJ and returning to the source material for AQ, leading to a well thought out plot and some beautiful CMOS sub plots. <br /> <br /> Now this is not an all-out game of Indiana Jones. It is also not a bad attempt to be so. This car is a personal plot and is a beautiful display of the AQ / KSM epic. The audience was filmed on a site in South Africa, where beautiful (if desolate) scenes, indigenous cultures, and some wonderful wildlife imagery are given to blend seamlessly with the shows and tell the story here. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyom surprised me completely with this one, as I never did one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I hated most of his work as a director, even this attempt. I hope this is a new vein of talent and seemingly less fortunate. <br /> <br /> This version 9.8 / 10 is classified on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
