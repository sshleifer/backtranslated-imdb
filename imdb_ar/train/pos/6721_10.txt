If it is possible to distill the heart and soul of this sport - no, and the pure lifestyle - to navigate to its ideal form, this documentary did. This documentary shows that life is not just about waves, but more about people and pioneers and the modern-day vanguard that drives the big wave envelope further than it was before. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual ski legend in my early 80s when I was a teenager - unleashed amazing reactions to stock quotes and interviews to their essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of this Type. When his heart and spirit are in the subject - and it is clear here - his genius is fraught with a pure vision that does not shine or adjust or sympathize with his subject. It sanctifies surfers and the lifestyle of surfing / beach, but it does not cancel it either. There is a deadly truth to the sport as well. <br /> <br /> There is much to be said about this documentary, about my surfers, the early history of the sport and the big wild wave surfers it features. Jeff Nol, the first person with a large wave can be said to be the leader of this sport; Jeff Carter, a stunning man who rode alone for 15 years aboard the Maverick in the very dangerous north of California; and at the heart of the documentary, Laird Hamilton, the great Christ in the current waves, /> <br /> There is a huge heart and warmth among all these men - and a few girls who show up on the camera - and a deep and strong love for browsing and the environment that comes through every word. I found the story of how he met Hamilton's adoptive father and how Hamilton was forced as a young boy aged 4 or 5 years to be practically his father and especially intimate (and again, stripped of emotional feeling). <br /> <br /> If you like surfing the web - or even if you do not like it - it's a great documentary to watch, just because you're a student in the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly good workmanship art.
