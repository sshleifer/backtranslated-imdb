As predictable as the Hallmark card, but not without merit, the rookie makes a strong outing. Dennis Quaid, the most attractive actor working today, is perfect as the science teacher turned to baseball player Jamie Morris. The film was never given to children, as would be expected from a film rated G. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best films I've seen since Any Given Sunday.
