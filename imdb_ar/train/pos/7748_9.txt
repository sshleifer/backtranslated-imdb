Tom wanted to make a film for a long time and did. It looks as though he is imagining a dirty, worn notebook filled with the wonderful little ideas he has been filling and carrying for 10 years. No personal transformations grant, no Hollywood components only life and a bit of magic. Balance, in speed, in the strangeness of comedy versus drama is completely weighing. This movie takes you on a journey ended before you realize how nice it was. The music is fantastic and your eyes will be equally satisfied. The fact that this film is not about anything, just a series of drawings of people mainly associated with a party of characters, makes it fun and very enjoyable, it is wonderful because it is empty. Between the lines happens. To see or not see, that is?
