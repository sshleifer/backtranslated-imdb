The traditional Western is synonymous with wide open spaces, open morals, narration of inevitable stories, and optimistic faith in the ability of heroes to shape their destiny, to escape their past. These qualities directly reflect the American sense of self, the dream of self, the push of borders and borders, which is why opportunistic politicians are still hinting at this kind. With some noble exceptions (such as Wilman, Hawks), the West was devoid of neurological diseases or real anxiety. Anthony Mann has changed all this forever, and this is his first invasion of this kind is one of the most violent and dynamic and complex, so as not to say the most exciting Westerners. <br /> <br /> The traditional western depends on the hero embodies the perfect rugged, whatever adversities that may have been in the past, pro-regime and right, which dominates the film, removes its obstacles, and re-enacts in reality; The irony, driving the plot, forces the hero to act certain. The difference between the two is often as mythically simple as wearing white or black hats. <br /> <br /> Mann's background was in Noir, a genre that contrasted with wide open spaces and optimism. Neuer was charged with a neurological charge, focusing on solving the unstable protagonist, where ethics are unclear, and the hero is often the villain, trapped in an inner maze of his own making, a negative victim of fate. Noir revolves around retreat rather than progress, questioning and denying modes and signs of representation, not creating and confirming them. <br /> <br /> WINCHESTER 73 is fraught with Noer's anxiety. Noir is often considered a psychologist, imagining the trauma suffered by the protagonist's head. 73 He does this too, and more troubling is that the protagonist is beautiful, Jimmy Stewart, where he began his series of brilliant hard films with Man and Hitchcock. In many ways, good-looking and sweet, representing the right and trying to restore unrest in the natural order, it is also close to the madness that will not stop at anything to achieve the deadly revenge, which reflects his diligent pursuit of Ethan Edwards in the seekers of inhumane insistence, This endeavor, his violent nuns is truly terrifying to testify. <br /> <br /> As in Noir, his anxiety is a psychic base - unlike most "healthy" heroes who have died since McAdam's father has managed to complete the process; his brother's pursuit is less morally repugnant than the protests of suffering against stunted growth . Climate correction is not obsessed: it is once again swinging back into a "normal" society, and has just witnessed some of the most horrible atrocities in the world. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the film is that it is not really about the hero or the villain at all, but an unfamiliar piece of weoponry that drives the movement. The 73 is opened with a distinctive title gun, displayed behind a glass window, while its fans are surrounded, burned, unmarked, or surrounded by admirers outside. During the film, human power is reduced to the most arbitrary characters - changing names. Lynn and Dutchmen shoot each other because they do not have weapons; questions lose their moral vitality and their practitioners deviate from the madness. A man is only worthy of respect when he is named; another man has been revealed as a coward when he abandons his fianc√©e to the Indians; the weapon retains his status, power and kidney. <br /> <br /> This is not the plot that leads the film, but the story of Venice. This leaves the film out of traditional expectations, creating a strange, strange and modern feeling. We have fallen into a conspiracy of vengeance so that when we follow, with Venice, another plot in full, we feel a little puzzled. <br /> <br /> This assertion of Venice, the symbol of strong masculinity, actually allows criticism of that masculinity, revealing detailed and useless rituals at the expense of society and order; brutal capitalist greed. Indian traders killers who deceive the seller and dimension. Cowards. Psychological killers Before returning to their true owner, a broken hero is completely compromised, and who has become as deadly as the killer he seeks. The gun is never printed in the name of its owner, not only because there is no fixed owner, but because there is no fixed masculinity, and an urgent language for the traditional Western world. <br /> <br /> 73 Brings Western legends brilliantly. - White Airb, Dodge City, Cavalry, Civil War, West Wide Open - just to undermine them. Earp enjoys an inflated reputation that is the name but never proved - Dodge City is no safer against outlaws than any other place; an incompetent cavalry (Custer has lost Little Big Horn) shows that the bitter dispute of the war is irrelevant. The myth of the open west is the site of a very closed, closed-circuit conspiracy that cuts off its characters and refuses to let it shape its fate, but allows it to form it. <br /> <br /> The Old John John A silhouette of riders is drawn on a vast mountain, but the signs here do not offer but the repetition and roundness. But despite its disintegration, the film is vividly concrete in a way that few Westerners have achieved. Man's clear technique permeates his camera at critical locations, alternating the detection of the distance with intensive examination, making saloon doors and buoys look alive and pleasant.
