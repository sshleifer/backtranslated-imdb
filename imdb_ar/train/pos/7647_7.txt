Well, so you borrow a bit of "It's a wonderful life", but this was 44 years before this film, so why not try it again. Belushi is having a corrupt 35 birthday. He did not get his clothes, his coffee, and lost his job. When a car driver who described himself as "a big blue piece of sh **" breaks down at the end of the day. Head to the empty bar to call for a pull. While waiting, he was recognized by the waiter (Kane) as the child who lost a baseball match in the city 20 years ago. This is what made him think about how life would be if he won the game. He discovers when Ken is unaware of a dose of action in a cup given to him by the queen of the party (Rosso) as his wife, and makes him the head of the sporting goods company. Cayenne later reveals himself as responsible for this change, but Belushi is not on board the entire plane. He never changes, and in the development of a conspiracy that does not kill the film but is still strange, tries to attract his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, and is now married to someone else. The good step is that they do not spend too much time in it, because they basically tear "Ghost", where Belushi constantly tells Hamilton things you can only know. It also brings a dramatic element, with two lovers in the shade, a new wife Rosso, and his unbalanced cox lover. But the film keys are a fairly long start, and the end is cheerful. Also a good work of the great and well-known cast, as Belushi is very beloved, the women were chosen very attractive, and Sen is very easy to become a title man. Strangely, this is Baluchi's second film in 1990 and he deals with an alternative lifestyle for riches, which is found in "Business Care". Despite the similarity, both films have the same level of laughter provided. So check out this to explore the fun of "What if?"
