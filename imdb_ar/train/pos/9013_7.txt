Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth watching. I chose it because of the actors, and I commend Bonham Carter and Pranach for different roles from those they have done in the past. They both portray very disturbed people, full of warts, but they make them loved because of their humanity. The story is impressive, but the performances are soaring. The film "Jane" by Bonham Carter is a wonderful achievement. His search for romance opened my eyes to aspects of disability I had not thought of before, but it was also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended very abruptly, but better than its emotionally manipulated end (see Stepmom.) The very real English setting was added to my enjoyment - England was in the 1990s, both urban and rural, without feeling depressed.
