I saw this movie after watching a version of Paltrow. I found that one very good, I think this will not be good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and fun! I found Jeremy Northham "more acceptable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that "Strong" holds better than Austin Knightley. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who likes Austin wrote, should watch this movie. I agree with * WARNING *: Andrew Davis has changed some things, but he is still loyal to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
