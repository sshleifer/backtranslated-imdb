What I like about you is one of those series that you need to see but you're not sure you'll see, the start is great and you'll catch up on the series just for fun, the second part of season 2-3 which is more stressful, come and go in what you want. What happens with many serials is that they do not end with something special because the second part of the series always comes down in exchange, and this also does somewhat, and the third part is the part that spoils and destroys the entire chain, usually, but it is not, In fact, I was very angry with all these guys in Fall's life. In fact, I wanted to finish Jeff in the end, but they changed later. He chose to take you to the series after almost 3 seasons without him. Make this series in the foreground. <br /> <br /> Watch it several times, the series is really wonderful I do not expect the second part to be good, but the third part does what is required and make serial serial worth everything, I am happy to say that I am happy and happy in the series and now I will go to see two players Girl and pizza place, when I saw the whole chain I would return ...
