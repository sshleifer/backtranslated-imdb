"This marine man," as other comments explained, is a rare and well-photographed look at the activities of the Lighter Air LTA (LTA). The LTA crews were truly proud that the convoys they were shading never lost a ship to attack the submarines. Photography at different NAS sites gives a valuable glimpse of the type of flight that has long since ended. However, the first half of the film revolves around Beery, his relationship with his friends in service, his interview with Tom Drake and his mother, and the repair of Drake's leg. Only then does the second film begin. The second film is mostly LTAs at work, with its appearance on the surface, kills men and causes a lot of damage. The appearance is brave and somewhat realistic, I imagine. Then we turn to Southeast Asia. Does the Navy have LTAs out there? It does not matter, this part is really wild, where the bulb is used to extract some aircraft crews that have been dropped from the forest. Japs shoot like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, leisurely. That's the talk we're talking about. In the end, World War II drama is satisfied with a very unusual part of the war.
