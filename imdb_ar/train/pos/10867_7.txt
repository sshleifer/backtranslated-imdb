I was spotted in the movie listing guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this film was in the show. Basically, a new president of the Hong Kong Triadis Wu Sing Society is elected, so you can imagine the scale of the violence that will happen during this. The conflict between the "candidates" Lam Locke (Simon Yam) and Big Dee (Tony Leung Ka Fei) to control the oldest and most powerful parts of the Trinity in society. He starred as Louis Coe as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jit, Chung Sei Fei as Mr. Su, Lam Sweet in Big Head and Lam Ka Tong as Kun. There are some good realist themes and moments related to corruption, just about enough actions, apart from perhaps when the police intervene, but the sequel sequel, so they are very exciting crime drama. very good!
