I have seen this as part of my studies at the University of Aberystwyth and amazes me how this has no distributor in the UK. Well, it is not, because this film is all not Hollywood movies - original, creative, strange and humorous. It seems that no one really wants to see this type of film, because it is the simplest terminology, does not conform to the general conventions that most young viewers are looking for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I have not written a review for IMDb for ages but I felt the inclination to give this movie a special mention, even if it was during a 30 minute break between the classes! Basically, it is not about anything, as the two main characters sink into a world of nothingness through the world's hatred. The intelligence here is how the director keeps attention through the majority of the runtime with only two letters, and when the only realistic scene consists of half a house and a vast blank white space. This is largely due to the great performance of the actors, both of whom present some great laughs while at the same time being able to add a great emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I would like to write some more but I am in a time limit. However, I encourage everyone and everyone to experience this film. A very unique concept is displayed on the screen in a cohesive and well executed way with a mix of good performance, strong text, beautiful sound design and impressive images that create a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> It's a shame only a few people know nothing ....
