This, in my opinion, is much better than any of the two versions of the 1990s, but it is still not good. It seems to be dated, perhaps because it is, but it stands well compared to other parts of the BBC 1980 era such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this modification allows much better adaptation of the book than any of the 2 90 versions, and St. John's Rivers are at least covered, though not good. Timothy Dalton is very good like Rochester, but the actress who plays the role of Jane is very old. There is certainly room for TV adaptations of this length that has been spent more than lighting it.
