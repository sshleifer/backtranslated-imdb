Jerome Krabi has a leading role in this film. I saw this movie 6 times and still am not exhausted. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some respects. Gerald Sutman is a great writer. He wrote all the films of Paul Verhoeven Dutch. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all his movies except for the girls in the show. My mother does not like him very much, but I do not agree with him. I think all his movies are a trip to see Total Rikel and the instinct of the foundation especially. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith was not dead. The Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
