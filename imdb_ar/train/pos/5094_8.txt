If you are clean, do not waste your time - otherwise, grab your hat and enjoy the adventure. I liked the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is very good, but it's quite different. I will not separate the differences because they will spoil the film. It's also a pleasure to see Allison Doddy again (I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones team), and Patrick Sweezy is as good as Quatramin, and the actors are superbly backed. I find quality cast one of the brands for the production of Hallmark and this film was no exception. Cinematography is fantastic and the result is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
