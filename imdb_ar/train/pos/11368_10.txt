A very complex and surprising study of the first serial killer in the Soviet Union. This intensive piece was set in the days of perestroika in full with performances by Stephen Ree and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This examination of Cicatillo was done as a casual killer and by hinting at some of his behavior while showing others truly, there is accuracy without being shown publicly. Not for the weak heart, but the subject is often annoying but necessary for its full development of the main participants in this truth-based story. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with an excellent film in an extraordinary way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece. Is in my top 10 must see menu.
