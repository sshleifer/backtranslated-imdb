Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a great film, but it left a wonderful taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, by contrast, is a little less polished, but it is a much better film. It is a historical film that combines timeless themes and true historical values, while Braveheart has a stark and unspeakable gloss on an old story. What makes this movie is cast. Liam Neeson plays the role of the hero, in a role he has primarily installed (in a dilute manner) in the Phantom threat. The character is heroic, but she is not the greatest fighter and no more devil lover. After an impressive human, he leads the screen. Against him are set a group of equal human opponents including Tim Roth Cunningham, notorious but hideous but brilliant, and John Hurt is morally bankrupt. It is worth mentioning that Jessica Lange, wife of Rob Operation: is also strong and noble, but 300 years from the modern heroine, which should be so. This is not the most common film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and powerful performances make you interested.
