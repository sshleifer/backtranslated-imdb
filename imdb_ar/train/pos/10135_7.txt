What begins as a somewhat unpredictable affair is ultimately hilarious and very entertaining. The "right to die" is not disturbing, but more than compensated for with some of the most important external pieces. <br /> <br /> The spoilers are here: <br /> <br /> The most important credits also went to the deadly performance of Martin Donovan as one of the most vile characters ever to fine-tune the screen. Playing the character in a "secluded" style is great. You'll feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan finally fails. Corbin Birsen also chews the scene of a man who is not good and gets just candy. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler. <br /> <br /> As a revenge of the dead flick, the "right to die" benefits greatly from its performance and is more than just a good way to spend less than an hour.
