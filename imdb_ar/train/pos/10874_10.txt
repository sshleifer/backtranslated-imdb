<br /> <br /> I have to admit, I was expecting something quite different from the first look of "Cut" last night, although I was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror sensation. I'm a true horror lover as far as they came, and I found "Cut" not only one of the best types of productions ever produced by Australia, but one of the best satirical / comedies in recent times. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mainstream crowd may not pick up many comedies - the film was not too smart in its application, but made me laugh at every turn trying to accommodate every possible cliche of the kind of horror they could doing it. I'm sure this was intended as humor .... hoping it was intended as humor. <br /> <br /> Of course, there was a gorge. <br /> <br /> Using the "Customize" garden shears were wonderful - along with the expected stabs and cuts. In short, there has been a great deal of diversity and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to satisfy even skeptical filmmakers of this value. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Kelly Minogue (in short was her appearance) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the film - both performances were wonderful, as was Simon Bossel ("The Castle") in a wonderful role as a jokey artist. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie is one of the best horror products that have appeared in the couple or the past years, as well as a satire / spoof-a-toungue-in-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> I loved him. Go see it!
