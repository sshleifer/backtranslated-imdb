This was one of the best films I've ever seen. The film relates to real life and how drugs can play a major role. Although this film seems to have been produced from a low budget, I found it interesting to watch it. <br /> <br /> Some may not like the story and say the script lacks direction. However, when the person gets deep into drugs such characters, there is no direction is life. I feel that this film is a careful representation of what might happen to someone if he is faced with strong temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are newcomers to the industry. However, they all pulled out very well. Everyone seems to be doing their jobs well and getting into their personalities appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or family member involved in drugs that seems to be spiraling out of control. This movie may frighten them enough to change their ways.
