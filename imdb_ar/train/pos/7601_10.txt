Lost is one of its kind ... It is enchanting and full of suspense, excitement and emotions all at the same time. I have never seen a television series like this before. It is full of jungle excitement and has a good scenario. The actors have excited life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost on the island while watching it. It is an excellent work that tells in a very intelligent way. The series is like a movie that depicts the lives of the survivors who lost on an abandoned island. I feel tempted to watch one episode after another and strongly recommend this series to all television program lovers. Watch it to see the magic of loss anywhere.
