Well, this is Ivan Retman's film. With a rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are generally not "deep", but they are mostly amusing enough. My former girlfriend surprised me, and I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is very big and I love her photos. I love Luke Wilson too, and Rainn Wilson was an outspoken holler. The film is not taken seriously at all, it ended up at the top of the page, but it is not unique, and it does not go where no one has ever gone ... It's a great rental although it's probably a good movie, especially if you have The movie headache does not want to strain your mind. It's fun to escape and there's nothing wrong with that. When you strip things "super girl", you leave a story about relationships, relations strained. It is a boy who meets a girl, a boy leaves a girl something. In the end, the characters look for love. Not all of them take "dumped" as well as can .... slice of life with twist.
