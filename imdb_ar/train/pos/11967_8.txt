I do not know if this is a comic play or not, but I agree that it is one of the greatest television programs ever. It's great that this show is still being broadcast. I love Michelle. She had nice episodes when she was a child and she talked, sometimes she said something funny. Sorry. <br /> <br /> This offer can be linked to children, teenagers and .. Well, families during their struggle in difficult times and trying to solve them as a family do not know who will ever refuse the chance to see this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love this episode when I think its name is DD .. The older girl stole a sweatshirt and learned a lesson about the robbery. That was a great episode. An example of this TV show is a family that works things as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this offer to everyone.
