The COLD BLOOD is brilliantly directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also designed to be a reality, sometimes it is more clinical than entertainment. Narrating the brutal murder of a Midwest family, the author Truman Cabot focused on Minutia, Wolf himself and the reader on the subject and subjects! Brooks departs violently from this approach to favor something closer to Docudrama. Although it is depicted on physical sites, it preserves it after. The killers are portrayed as spoiled corrupt, and they certainly are. They are not perceived as misunderstood souls (as in Capote) and the brutality of their actions is frank and frightening. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are as excellent as murderers, as with supporting actors, including John Forsyth and Paul Stewart as a reporter for Capote.
