Glory to Fossett to take on roles, at that time was considered controversial. As I recall, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely scrutinized at the time. <br /> <br /> Faust is simply a woman to follow, followed by actor James Russo. It is enough as a man obsessed, but sometimes transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwood has a simple role, like Alvary Woodard as a homemaker. Woodard is concerned about the legal consequences when Fusit, the victim of rape, avenges the culprit. The scene in which a hot oil pan is set in Rousseau is classic, and the rapist deserves it. Then keep it in bondage, and you must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> A very true story that reflects the feelings and anger of rape victims who have been abused, physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 10/08.
