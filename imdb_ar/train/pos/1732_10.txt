"Sandra, the women's industry" is a prominent feature in the exploits, and it is also for two reasons: (1) excellent performance, but not effort, for Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Greaver was at the top of the project. These two talents, both of which are very scornful, make Sandra a movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Another key element to the success of the film is realism - there is nothing fake or "Hollywood" about this film in the California group. It's really a slice of life. Sandra's humble home at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by her character, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bounce on her front door, Sandra sits on the couch without being manufactured while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, As real as if she just woke up (but is still pretty), the eccentric Sandra picks up the likes of making her love her wearing a bra, a one-room flat to Sandra-moved - all elements of the film look absolutely real, and as such, are attracted The viewer to Sandra's small world from the beginning becomes a Mah Come immediately and want her to succeed. Sandra presents her arguments for her free love with eloquence and dignity and comes with many students. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have failed in less efficient hands and could have exploded in any of the usual sexual exploitation trends, but the Garver / Gill team sees Sandra not only as a woman But made of an excellent film.
