The film is a true demonstration of how the upper society becomes unemotional and selfish. It contains a lot of characters and each character represents a different category of people. There is no 100% good character and morally unlike the heroes of all typical Hindi movies and there is no 100% bad character but they are all completely different. The film is a very perfect combination of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked the film raised some social questions. I recommend everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering hip-hop concerts in Bollywood on page 3 of the paper, but this is the story of how she became a reporter for crimes in the newspaper. But that's not all. He shows how she could not survive there, when she helped save some innocent children, and how her voice was brutally suppressed. Until they are separated from the job. She was then unable to find a job as a reporter for the crime and must do so again. Not only her but there are too many interlocking characters in the film and they all give a different feeling while watching the movie. I would really like to congratulate the director on producing such a wonderful film. Please do not afford to miss it.
