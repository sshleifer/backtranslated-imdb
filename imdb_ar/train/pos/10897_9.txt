What do you expect from a film entitled "Christmas Survival" and its presentation as "festive fun", something like Gandhi or an English patient? There are a lot of things I like about this film, it's funny, it's very good and written in a great way. I came to the movie as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but I was suspicious when I read the plot, it seemed ridiculous. But the film does not look that way because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his role ideally, one minute as an adult, and the next day a mature man realizes he has earned everything in life no matter what he really wants. In fact we see Latham grow up in this film, when he encounters the problems of those who envy them and realize that their lives are not good, he sees that his lot is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie contains fewer or less unusual scenes than the other comedy I have seen. Comedy is much harder than any other kind of drama. It either works or does not work and very few comics are correct every time. I particularly like the scene of the drama, where the family takes to read the parts written by to accuse. Pleasure in the reaction of Tom Falco (James Gandolfini) and comments by Brian Falco (Josh Zuckerman). It's the greedy Tom Falco's dilemma that he has to bite his tongue or wear silly hats or sing the Christmas tree in order to win the prize money that keeps the film going. <br /> <br /> The addition of Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in the Christmas movie? Of course it is tacky and seductive. He is rich and handsome, he is beautiful and one, and therefore inevitably, and will end up falling together in the snow and find herself face to face. Great! One thing I wanted was to use more festive music to enhance the atmosphere but I can not really complain. Got what I wanted.
