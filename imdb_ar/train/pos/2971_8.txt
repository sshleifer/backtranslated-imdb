I found this movie very funny, I liked how to make a modern sports policy. This movie is not as funny as South Park but very funny. As a sports fan, I loved how they ridiculed some of the ridiculous things in sports. This is a great movie for non-sports fans as well, and it may be better for them in reality because they have to go on living and wonder why people follow the sport in this conclusion when there are a lot of complex rules and complexity in sports and the fact that it means nothing at all. I have also found that the actual game they have reached is interesting, it is a kind of horse that has rules and psychological (for the person who shoots). In general, I highly recommend watching this film, and I think you'll end up loving this movie. But if this type of comedy is not your favorite, you may not like it. (But this with no comedy film)
