It saddens me to say that I do not agree with other people in this Colombo episode. Death condemns a hand that is frankly kind of boring to me. After several times, I feel bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Colp, Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than others. First, Robert Kolb plays Ray Milland. He employs him to investigate with his beautiful young wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she has an affair. In contrast, the character of Culp, a cheating wife who plans to expose his plot to her husband, is proving to be spoiling his career. Out of anger, Kolb killed her by beating her in the face and placing the body elsewhere. I do not know, I do not know. Maybe I did not care for this one at all. Of course, Colombo gets it in the end. It's just a matter of how.
