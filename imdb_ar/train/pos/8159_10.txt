Okay. This movie is pure fun. It's a violent horror ever mixed with a little thrill and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and it is fun to watch him do it. This movie is for some people, though. Either love her or hate her completely. A good movie to rent out and watch it when you do not have anything else to do. Also recommended: psychological third
