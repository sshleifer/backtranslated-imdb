Greetings back from darkness. An insight into and motivated by a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who must work ... regardless of circumstances, otherwise the reason for his livelihood will depend. To see the Goldsworthy statues alive, see his reaction to everyone who is very snobbish. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It's his life. When you see his failures, energy seems to be expelled from his body like the hot air balloon exploding. It is not a fear to start again, it takes his energy from his work. Watching it only creates a capture of nature and recalls its somewhat painful work, however, breathtaking. Discussing the flow and time in the Minimal dialog appears to be a doubt that the artist has one earth in himself. When he says he needs land, but he does not need it ... I beg for disagreement. The only complaint is that the musical result seems to slow down the pace of relaxation at best.
