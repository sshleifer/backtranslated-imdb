A realistic portrayal of acne for the group, but it is also appealing to older viewers like me. It had ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see films with black urban figures that can appeal to older and non-black audiences and present a more realistic picture of black youth. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place on campus and the city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background, there are many friends' knowledge and attitudes that affect them for the better or for the worse. A typical plot might say some, but this was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself deeply rooted in the couple's relationship and seeing my own past in their story. Moments of deep reflection and revelation came pouring in from the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It's a bright film I support for those young at heart and in love or in love ever. Great movie I'll look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
