First, I must say I made a mistake in watching the election films out of sequence. I say unfortunately, because after seeing the first two elections, the election looks a bit disappointing. Both films are epic bands similar in shape. Although the elections are an enjoyable part of the cinema ... they are not as good as the sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first batch of elections, we showed the competitors to the chairman; After a few scenes of debate between the "uncle" as to who should have the title of president, they decided (almost unanimously) that Luke (Simon Yam) would take the lead of the trio. Suffice it to say that this does not go well with the rival Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai). In an attempt to influence the takeover, Big D abducts two uncles in order to influence the election board alongside him. This has catastrophic consequences and leads the triads to a comprehensive war. Locke is determined to become president but will not officially become able to recover "Dragon Head Baton", a physical representation of the President's authority. Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden the stick somewhere in mainland China, and the race is about to find out who can recover it first. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie has been dedicated to restoring Baton. As both ambitious leaders look, they must avoid the police and the opposing sides, leading to one of the highlights of the election, including a jet plane named Jet (Nick Cheung), a sickle, and many bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung is an attention that draws attention to the very least ... I wonder if this is the director affected by Johnny Toe in any way during the second election, as he presents more than a character Jet in sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung offers to steal the scene, he should not fail to present it because of the rest of the film's actors. The election is distinguished by an impressive selection of actors with well thought out and influential presentations. Simon Yam is usually glorious himself and the film also benefits from Hong Kong heavyweight representatives such as Louis Ku, Tony Leung Ka Fei, and Su Lam. There are really no weak links in representation and one can easily think they are seeing real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the shows are great, one of the most impressive things about the election is Johnnie To's eye for the camera. There are some really stunning shots in the film, needless to say that knowing how framing the footage certainly has it, where the viewer is treated to a series of innovative camera angles and very impressive. All this makes the election, and above all, a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film often arises from the sheer number of characters involved in the election. It is difficult to follow it a bit because the film is full of characters that are not part of the plot. While the supplement chooses to focus more on the candidates, the first elections present the electoral process as a whole with many uncles, subordinates and police officers who are huddled in the story. Perhaps the film could have worked better if it had taken longer with more time allocated to Traid's internal work, or if director Johnny Toe had conveyed the necessary elements and explained them more. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - all in all, it's a fantastic wild movie with a wonderful team, an excellent direction, and a fast upgrade to pack you up. It is a bit more complicated than was required.
