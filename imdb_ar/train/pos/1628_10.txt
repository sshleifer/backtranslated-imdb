This bar is nothing the hilarious movie I have ever seen. From the four displaced persons who were expelled by their parents to the Feinberg Military Academy, a constant tone has been set up throughout this aerial film, and does not stop for a second time. <br /> <br /> It is a difficult attempt to describe this film; the elements of humor are very clear and I have brilliantly voted that when you first glance, it seems nothing more than a stupid teen comedy. But this is much more! Up the Academy, inspired by the minds of these people in MAD, offers a formula and style I have not seen since then by any of the "hottest" Hollywood shows of the past few years. Essentially, the film is full of baby corn balls so you can guess that the writers were 14 years old. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". traditional. *****
