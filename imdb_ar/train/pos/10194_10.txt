This could have been much better if it were made as Mitchell in Malta. After that, at least, we were saved from seeing Joe Don Becker as he ran through the scenic Mediterranean, dressed in silly-looking cowboy clothes ... not to mention acting like an old gunman in the west. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film will not suffer from the lack of police brutality without justification either. Oh, okay. At least the comic comments of Mike and the Butts made this fare enjoyable as a ring from MST. I can not imagine seeing him alone.
