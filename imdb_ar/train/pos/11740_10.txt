I have no doubt that critics have criticized this film, especially the art of fartsys who needs to lax. This is a great movie of the vehicle in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or recently Don Knotts. Never shake the world or change the movies forever. What you will do is entertainment. When everything is said and done this is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. It even contains a simple and nice moral message at no extra charge. I always loved the Elvira TV program when I was living in Los Angeles. Shetik did not really steal from Vampira more than he stole from the original, Tida Bara. This kind of mythical figure belongs to everyone who does the best; & Cassandra Peterson does it better. Long live the Viera we need more of this kind of movies. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. It exudes exquisite refined slag. I did not find technical errors. Execution is closer to the disadvantages of the technical model. My deep greetings to the director, James Siniorli, and all his crew.
