This movie was fun but for the wrong reasons. The coordination between the series of events is laughable, and makes the movie contains funny moments for a slap stick. Robert Genti and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene near the end. "You're definitely checking out my favorite friend," Williamson says to Genti. I enjoyed this film only for Jenny and Williamson, but I did not enjoy telling the story that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest probably stuffed. A movie that contains more than 30 parts only contains a credit list of 10 or more people. It seems odd that no one else has credit in the film, and perhaps they have some insight into how the final product appears. The only thing that this film is doing is that it is absolutely violent, making it triple with Fred Williamson and Robert Genti for a movie worth watching.
