FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming, fun, and thrilled movie with RKO music with Astaire and Rogers. Although he lacks the great tunes at SWNG TIME (although the last number "has to face music and dance" is one of the best teams in the team he is right), but it's very fun, as these two can not make mistakes together In 1930. Again, the plot is lightweight and can be forgotten, but watching the dance between Fred and Stinger together is a pure sky. These two people moved more romance and magic into dancing than many couples in movies in a great love scene. While there are many unique musical performances and Ginger, it is definitely a must.
