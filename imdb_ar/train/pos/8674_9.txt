Tess is a typical Tom and Jerry model - a short case was designed, conflict arose and subsequent chaos. The characters behave in appropriate ways, and the natural tensions between the various personalities lead to general chaos. The best part (and funniest) is when the peace treaty is in effect and respected - all kinds of strange wonders appear before your eyes. WARNING - It is not wise to let Tom help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Highly recommended.
