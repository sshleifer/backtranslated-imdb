This is very good, made for TV movies. It depicts a problem in the suburbs around the 1970s and the kind of neighbors that one does not necessarily want to be. The worst and most disturbing part of the film was when the evil teens killed the family dog. Adolescents do their best to annoy and harass this poor family. But boy !, do you revenge the main character of these evil teenagers in the end. Surely the father / homeowner does not take all the aggravation of the nasty little boys and quick revenge after lack of help from the police. Standing in front of them and protecting his home and family. A very good actor .. has been added. <br /> <br /> I watched this on TV when I was 8 or 9. I never saw it on TV and I wanted it. Definitely a good idea! It's a kind of film that you make one week a very late night and can not stop watching or watching an afternoon movie on the weekend. It's the kind they never showed. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching!
