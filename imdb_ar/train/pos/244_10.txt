I did not know what to expect from "Ned Kelly", but I absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and sweeping. I also felt that I was very authentic and felt that I was moved back to 1800. I was never a fan of Heath Ledger, where I only saw him in teen movies, but he is strong in this role. Ledger plays the role of Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, and shows us how he became the most famous killer boy in Australia. Naomi Watts is a wonderful supporting role as a Kelly community enthusiast. Highly recommended - this is from Aussie!
