Vido is a nice comedy worthy of wide recognition, especially given the mainstream folly that is supposed to entertain us these days. <br /> <br /> As we have already pointed out, this is a real zombie film, but it is not a real movie. Sweet spelling that uses the undead to point fingers. While there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no way to show this film (the feeling of comfort in the fifties), I can not imagine that anyone who is really scared or closed by Fido and his colleagues who suffer. <br /> <br /> While the cast is generally good, I felt that Moose and Nelson were standing up. The humor is not in your face, but rather defeated; there is a lot of attention to detail and I found myself smiling a few benign throughout the film. This is definitely not a cinematic masterpiece, but it does not seek to be - instead, Corrie has managed to make a black comedy that gives a sense of relief.
