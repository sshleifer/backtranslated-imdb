David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, very good) is a lawyer, more skilled at dealing with corporate taxes (and suffers from unusual dreams that are horrifying to see this indigenous man in the dark). He is invited to take up a case involving an indigenous group accused of killing one of the Named Billy .. We see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting them and kill when the leader of an indigenous tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses the "bone of death" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, the strange weather patterns around David are circulating in Sydney, such as rain falling on contaminated dirt and rocky hail during a bright blue sky (with no clouds, such as those hitting a school in central Australia), not to mention the rainbow " Distorted "which is divided into groups. As David follows the case, he finds it much closer to the strange events that occur than he could have realized. An indigenous man, Chris Gulpilil, appears in a dream carrying a stone of blood and finds that this man is one of those who will represent them in the trial! He found it quite possible, after some strange encounters with Charlie and the conversations with Chris, that he might be associated with a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams were an actual conflict of potential horrors that had yet to come. <br /> <br /> Understanding the horrific drama builds his story systematically, completely original and unexpected. With the Peter Wearer in charge, the film is visually packed, where we see these very overwhelming images of the possible rule of civilization, but the most convincing angle in the film is certainly David's journey to find that huge truth that plagued him as he uncovers Charlie and Chris countless, His men get out of a crime they did not commit, and finally know what to do with anything catastrophic happening or may happen later.
