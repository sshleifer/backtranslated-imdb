I've only seen this movie in the sneak preview and all I can say is ... "What did you just see ????" I mean it in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Still and black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is a hard working center, while Black is a dreamer. Black invented this idea to create a spray that erases the stool. The idea became very common, and black becomes very rich. Black's lucid lifestyle and the fact that he is still trying to be his best friend with Stiller, makes Stiller mad with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is plain weird. The strange trend, with a strange rotary open shot sequences sequence out of nowhere. The accent and representation is very strange. Strange in kind of walking. The audio track is the strangest thing in the movie, from the song "Envy" Alien that continues to reappear to the scene where you think you will hear the classic 80 song but suddenly in Japanese. <br /> So, the real question is this ... is it funny weird? This depends only on the individual. I was cracking in the storytelling oddity. After the examination I heard that people call it grand and happy because it is free. Strangely, I understood their point of view. There are no jokes at all, so if you are not addicted to the uniqueness of everything, you will hate this movie. I totally hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie is likely to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a classic on DVD worship. If you're laughing at a movie without real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I suggest you watch it. If you do not, escape this movie. It will only make you crazy.
