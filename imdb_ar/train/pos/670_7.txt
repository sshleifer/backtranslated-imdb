The last wave will never win the mainstream audience. It is a slow motion film and wonderful for those who want to keep up with it. Australian real estate lawyers are required to take on the case of five indigenous people accused of murdering one of them. All sorts of extravagance and speech will soon emerge, as the death of a man involves a tribal problem that was not reserved for the White Man's Court, and soon the lawyer faces a problem distinguishing reality from fiction. It seems that the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the indigenous people may know that but no one knows him. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at its peak here. David Guptel, a face familiar to many other Australian clicks and a decent actor, is one of five indigenous people under trial. The last wave is not simply for everyone, anymore more than MAGNOLIA (both happen to them strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on a slow Saturday night.
