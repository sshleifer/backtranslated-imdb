If you do not see this, you do not know what you're missing. The first time you do this, you will feel pain in the case of lying on the ground and you get up laughing hard, and you may also wet yourself. <br /> <br /> It's funny. There has not been a single comedic performance until this date that I have seen top this or even come close. Lots of classic lines, stories, and classic songs .. <br /> <br /> Uncle drunk in the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say none of these things to anyone who has seen this performance I will bet on the cakes on the dollar, they will not be able to keep a straight face and they will laugh, or read the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Shame you can not get it on a DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
