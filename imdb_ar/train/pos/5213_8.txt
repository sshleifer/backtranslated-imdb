This is the first review I wrote about IMDb so naked with me, but I caught this click on HBO and I was sure I was happy to see it. Richard Gere is superb in this film as an agent / detective who wants to organize rules to accomplish the task. I think the story is wonderful, and there is never a dull scene that slows down the speed of the film. Some parts of the film that have to do with sex addiction are very shocking, but if you watch a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to see the scenes well. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good movie for the explorer / thriller, ignore the low rating that this movie got on the IMDb and definitely see it.
