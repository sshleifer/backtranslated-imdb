If you have watched this movie, I have visited Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and I have to shamefully admit that we (PR) live in real chaos now, drugs are the main cause of the shootings and killings we commit almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives are lost because of this. We no longer feel secure, and in addition, Adalah is no longer what we call truth and truth, but money, power and power. The "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real and unfortunate facts, and it really captures the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related killings, money and power manipulating courtrooms, innocent people and children who die and even die because of it. Ricardo and his wife Polly, with a realistic plot and a winning streak, are brave enough to make all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a nice and friendly country, living a nightmare that does not seem to end !!! ** Recently won the "Copper Wing" award for Best Director of the International Film Competition at the Phoenix Film Festival 2006.
