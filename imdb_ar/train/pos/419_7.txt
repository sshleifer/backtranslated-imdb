Contains the Cecil epic. Demille in the Old West on what may be the best performance of Arthur's commissions, as a hysterical, eccentric, incredibly immoral, but sincerely loyal to Jean-Karametti. It really pulled it off! Gary Cooper is in his most turbulent state, but runs some of his sometimes narrow words: "The plains are great, but the passages cross ... sometimes." The story is pastiche to end all pastiches. All Western cowboy heroes seem to exist in some way except Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story personally (or at least, Demel will believe us). There is no room for anything that fades like dexterity, it's the story of "stepping in the face" of the masses. However, something wonderful about this film is that it represents a direct attack very early on what Eisenhower called the Military Industrial Complex. It's not just a story about arms racers, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of Washington. But let's not get into politics, let's leave it to Demille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. The main interest of this film after all these years is that it uses the first degree film by George Antel, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, "Boy Boy Music." Antheil seems to have arisen from the "great sound" adopted by all subsequent Westerners, where the plains sings with the voices and voices of countless shepherds in the sky, celebrating open spaces and intertwined melodies. That's why it does not seem at all unusual, because we've heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to use the common echo of all the sagebrush in this symphony of the open skies that entered into the legendary American flag, and gave her a soundtrack that has never varied since then. It is interesting to see Anthony Quinn in the early appearance of Cheyenne Indians. Gabi Hayes is somewhere, but you're missing him in the crowd. Gary Cooper outperforms them all, looming large, but when was he young?
