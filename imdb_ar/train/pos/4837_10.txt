I was a young student of cinema in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and introduced the film "Cypriyad" to Kuchalovsky. Tarkosvky "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was surprised by the global dimension of the art form. Only then and only, I saw "Siberia" 4 and 1/2 hour epic and were speechless. The best way then Bertolucci "1900". quite! <br /> <br /> The Hope Andron site will somehow reach a negative and make the "restored version of the manager full" one day! On DVD of course! I also fought hard to defend this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equivalent to the Soviet film with bad taste! Time is milky.
