The first film for Selberg is not a hit. It is a beautifully made film without any flaws in the life of an African American woman. It also proves that not all films with African-American ethnicity as a center of story must be supported by an African American director. <br /> <br /> What I like in this film is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that she was based on a book. Furthermore, Danny Glover was as excellent as Mr. He is usually the same in most of his films. But in this, he is completely branching out and he is another person for once. However, the performance of the entire film resistance comes from Whoopi Goldberg. It's as excellent as Sealy. You will never forget these characters once you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I've heard that the musical version of it will be a movie too. All I can say is: I hope it's as good as this, because this film is a movie that should not be missed.
