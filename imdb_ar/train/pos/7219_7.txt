Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY! , The adaptation of Jay Preston Allen in the stunning Broadway movie Ira Levin, could not wait until the incarnation turned to the closing stage before putting it on the silver screen, so the producers decided wisely to make the most of White Way! The opening and closing scenes of the film are filmed at the intimate Music Box Theater in New York where they played DEATHTRAP for nearly five years. Even the recent fading of the film on the marquee theater is a copy of the famous play logo. (Although marketers have decided to use the rubik cube icon more fun for the movie.) <br /> <br /> Now on a low-price DVD version, DEATHTRAP looks as new as it was innovative. The cast is quite appropriate (better than their theater counterparts), and the site experts should be commended for finding a nervous home suitable for our "One Room, Exciting Thrill Two". Unlocked in surprisingly simple and innovative ways, Sydney director Lumet marks wisely on any "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves the center of twisted villain Levin alone. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film represents a major departure from Hollywood from the paintings and slightly undermines one of Levin's plot earlier in the film [Helga (about a dagger): "Another woman will use it because of playing."]. As with Robert Altman, the final player, the new film's finale helps to undo itself again and erases the boundaries between theater, screen and real life (can it be?)!
