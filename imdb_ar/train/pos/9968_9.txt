My mom took me to see this film as a child and I yearn to see it every year as I do all my favorite birthdays. What I remember most was the silly Satan and Santa looking through his telescope. I waited and looked at T.V. Every year then I see when it will be displayed. I usually find him playing on Saturday afternoon. I found only the English film that took something special away from the film and was eager to find a copy of it in Spanish. I bring this film, my dear to my heart, and I never suffer from nightmares as others may suggest. Yes, it's a different film from Santa Claus and that makes it unique and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids and I explain them to my favorite parts and memories !!
