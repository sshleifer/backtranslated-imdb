I had a personal interest in this film. When I was 17 and after graduating from high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Union of Workers and Transport Workers' Unions. At the end of my first day (sweeping the surface of an aircraft carrier) I was told to carry a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes and so on for a week or two. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting, and about 20 of us headed south towards San Diego. Shortly afterwards, we stopped at an army base called Kalan Camp or Han Camp. Once we were idle, we went north a few miles to Camp Pendleton, the great naval base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese island base in the Pacific. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, artillery bulldozers, trenches filled with sand and accommodation. All this was at a high salary, sometimes a "golden time", which was three times our normal hourly wages. Our food was also first class = the main rib at lunch, etc. - which is amazing because it was wartime and it is very hard to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> Once the job is done I eagerly waited for the movie to be released, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited impatiently for two hours before the show finally appeared on the screen. After that, it was not more than three or four minutes (perhaps less) of the film's heroes diving into the bombing of al-Qaeda and blowing it into mourning. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I later learned that this film was pledged by the government and that Fox paid on the basis of the extra cost, which probably represents our high salaries and lifestyle there. Bob Weaverka
