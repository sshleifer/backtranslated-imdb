Bette Midler shows her talent and beauty at "Diva Las Vegas". I'm thrilled to have recorded it and I can watch whenever I want to. They have what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and you will really like it. The highlight of the show was her singing "Be with Me" from her 1979 film The Rose. You can feel the passion in the song and you will end up with a goose. The show will leave you wanting to go out or rent a Bette Midler or go to the nearest music store and buy a Bette Midler.
