First of all, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Jenger Rogers was going to be terribly upset like Alice, a young British lady who has a starring role. Fontaine filmed the hero's image here, but her underrepresentation appears badly, and it is better to leave her dancing without mention. Fortunately, things continued to improve. <br /> <br /> But here, FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE Allen who got the best bills - they're excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be surprised by how easy Astaire's routine is in their dance. Of particular interest is the routine of the Great Fun House, which was won by Oscar-winning choreographer Hermes Ban. They join Astaire while it must be the highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you can not say much about the slow speed of the story - nor some stale positions that require a lot of patience from the viewer. It must be said that some humor flattens and that the usual romantic misunderstanding that occurs in any film Fred Esther in this period is given a traditional treatment. Only the musical breaks are the ones that give the story the lift you need. <br /> <br /> Some wonderful melodies of Gershwin appear once in a moment, but not all of them receive the treatment they deserve. The gentle support team includes Reginald Gardiner, at best in a polished comedic performance as a pompous servant, Constance Collier and Montague Love (as Joan Gostani's father made by Esther). <br /> <br /> Whenever Burns and Ellen are there to remind us of their laughter on radio and television days. Both of them are surprisingly superb in keeping up with Esther's work. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that Juan Fontaine's dance number at the foot of the hill with Fred is filmed at a secret distance, but the intelligent camera's work can not hide the fact that it is outside its element as a dance partner in Astaire, Painfully.
