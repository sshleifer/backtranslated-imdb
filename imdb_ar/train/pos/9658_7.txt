It seems that "Come Undone" raises a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum. Admittedly, it is a homeopathic film, as most viewers expect and somehow, to move away from this promise to an introspective view of the young man's spirit. The film has a way to stay with us even when it ends. It is a personal study of how a young man is involved in an affair with a much different person. In the end, Mathieu will be left in a state of confusion and pain and depression when things do not go according to what he hoped the relationship would be. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Leveszitz, the director of the film, told his story from Matthew's point of view. Most viewers seem to feel confused by the different times within the film, but there are hints that are not as clear, as one can see, retroactively. The story is listed in past memories that may add to the way some people will see the movie. This is a story about the loving love of Matthew that Cedric feels and the ultimate collapse of their lives together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, the handsome young man, follows Matthew until he manages to convince him that he loves him. Mathieu also feels the attraction of Cedric. We are aware of how different the young people are at the moment, as Cedric tells Mathew's family how he feels the school is not his. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an engineer, finds beauty in the deserted place that Cedric received. We see Matthew, who reads from the guide book, and wants Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Matthew goes to his mother, she tells him wisely about the importance of continuing his career. It also indicates what the future will have together, which proves to be true. It seems that Matthew learned his lesson the hard way. He goes on a mysterious life with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We see him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who treated himself. <br /> <br /> The end may be baffling for most viewers, but there is a moment in the film when Matthew goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking attentively at Pierre, the young man who frequents the bar. That's why Matthew searches for Pierre at his home, it seems hard to imagine. However, we have seen the way Matthew is clearly interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Matthew see the two of them walking on the sand, has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them while watching a little boy seem to be lost, but then realize that the father is close. > <br /> Jeremy Elkaim Mathieu is one of the most complex characters in modern films. This young man is difficult to understand at a simple level. Matthew has suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and loss of Cedric. Stefan Ridou, who has been seen in other important French movies, is equally good, as he is Cedric's shallow. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will split views, the film is worth watching because of the complexity and care Sebastian Lifshitz gives to this story.
