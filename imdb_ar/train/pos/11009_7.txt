There was a neat style for this film by director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective approximation. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northham and Lucy Liu give leadership roles and expand their scope. This film also included one of the most creative "Escape" scenes of recent years. The director and actors joined forces in an effective film. <br /> <br /> Although the layout of the film was wrapped up, the story was made very clearly when the layers of corporate greed and skulls were revealed. In 1949, George Orwell proposed in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and reduce human freedom. It was interesting that in this exciting future film, it was not the state, but the corporate world that controlled the human factor and devalued it.
