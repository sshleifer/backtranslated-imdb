The ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous film about a television reporter named Felix Anger, a maniacal obsession, moving with his best friend Oscar Madison, a sports writer and full-fledged style, after his wife Francis shoots them from their apartment. Absolutely divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets him from the moment he does so. The classic comedy Neil Simon first came to Broadway where Art Carney played Felix and Walter Matau as Oscar. Jack Lemmon Carney takes the lead in an unforgettable performance like Felix Anger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in this role, but so real that it brings an element of gloom to a deplorable personality, Felix Unger. Luckily, Mattha was allowed to return his role as Oscar, a unique gem of comedic performance that provides consistent laughter all the time. This team turned from Lemmon and Matthau to a comedic that was re-visited in nine other films. Since both of these actors are no longer with us, watching this classic game becomes more influential but not less joyful. Simon's play was well expanded on the screen with a silent introduction chronicling Felix's suicide attempt of depression which is the winner. Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner, as poker players at Oscar, play Moncia Evans, Carole Shelley as Piedgon Sisters and blind dates for Oscar and Felix. Of course, later became an excellent television series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. Joy from start to finish.
