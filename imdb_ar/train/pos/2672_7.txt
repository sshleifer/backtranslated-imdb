The film "The Journey of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and a hopeless Odyssey who are desperate to travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is fairly well designed, it lacks content and has many endorsements. Most of the 1.7-hour movie time is bus ride, get off the bus, get off the boat, get off the boat, get off in the truck, get out of the truck, etc; the time could have been better spent or completely excluded. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the crime of illegal trafficking of illegal immigrants. The hour is worthwhile and somewhat entertaining but more than appreciated.
