This fun and wonderful film is more than a snapshot of the most popular Pinop of all time from a typical autobiography, featuring the look and feel of the times with excellent soundtracks and everything you want in an independent film. I think the tilt would be to portray Bettie Page as a kind of fox sex, like Jayne Mansfield. But if you have looked carefully at Bettie's attitudes, she has always been happy. It's not a "hope you can get me" look, and it does not look like "I'm just doing this because my acting career did not work" with a porn star. Thus, the women involved in this film (three women producers, a writer / director, a contributing writer and the beautiful Gretchen Mall, which certainly helped me shape this role with her own sugary effect) have truly captured the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive southern girl, Taking her picture, and hoping not to be angry well. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Gritchen Mall had achieved a high professional performance (maybe she just had the most perfect breasts ever) and that's what happend, because she got the fuck. Several years ago, Vanity Fair was presented when no one really knew who she was and described her as the next girl. Let's be frank, that was a little presumption. I mean unfortunately they did not reach the status of Gwyneth, despite the lack of talent. Take some bad choices for the movie when a beautiful blonde in Hollywood Trimmer makes you tolerant. If it does not return it to list A, we will be a monkey. <br /> <br /> Bettie herself has not yet seen the film in particular. Bettie left the pinup party in a high place and fell in love with the old flame, Jesus. Everything floats your boat's honey. I was one very remarkable woman. Hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Aaron, I have completed the worship of idols.
