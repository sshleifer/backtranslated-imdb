This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave pretending to know or care about what communism was and how it was the real Russians or Britons, and if you accept and do not get hurt by the conventions, you can enjoy this film. Nicole Kidman at her best, exciting, and funny. Ben Chaplin has managed to avoid Nicole completely overcome him, and the rest of the actors do a good job as well. The final moves, the logical logic of the film, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
