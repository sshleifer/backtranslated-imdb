Thanks to Kevin Smith, there are a bunch of geeks running and saying that the Return of the Jedi is not good because it's really fun. And no no! Sharing puppets! This makes them bad! Everybody loved Jedi's return until someone in the movie Kevin Smith made a negative comment on him. Now all the surprised people look at you as if you were suffering from some sort of disease if you mentioned how much you liked it. This film is much better than anything that Kevin Smith thinks of him so that he baffles in my mind that the man thinks in his condemnation. This movie is a good fun! It's as wonderful as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the views of Kevin Smith! His owner is not right! <br /> <br /> That song Ewok was finally judged! I bet people do not even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will burn you all!
