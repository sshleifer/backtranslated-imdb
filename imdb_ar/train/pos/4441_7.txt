Well, before we review, I should ask: Why is this not listed individually? Perhaps it was just a television component in Italy, but for lovers of global Lamberto Bava this is his own film. In America, this movie is distributed on VHS and DVD, either "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "demons" apart from one member of the crew and staff. But yes, I personally felt upset because this was very difficult to find on this site which is very useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "The Ogre". I've watched this trailer many times on YouTube and found it truly scary. The film itself (length, and thus make it a film) contains many powerful parts and can intimidate him. I was satisfied with the latest procedure, but I'm not sorry at all to buy a DVD before watching it (available from Shriek Show). I think the origins of the television film explain the last chapter. I will not give any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is somewhat familiar: a horror writer who spends a holiday in an old nerve castle with her husband and son only to find it exactly like the nightmares of her childhood. There are faint echoes of "The Shining", but this is a different kind of supernatural horror. Women (Virginia Bryant) find more and more evidence that this is the real life place of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. Great atmosphere and terror-follow. <br /> <br /> The sequence of a nightmare was so terrible. The effect of the gullet was good, it reminded me a little of Uncle Frank's standing from the first Hellerizer. There are also a few good shocks and a good underwater scene. I give them the props that the film has never receded to mimic American films with similar concepts, "Nightmare on Elm Street." "Ghoul" is the origin. The beast itself was scary, when it was introduced correctly. <br /> <br /> An interview on the Shriek Show DVD with Lamberto Bava, who is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic writing "The series of devils," gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the film was filmed. The setting is too much in the film ... Simon Boswell also helps. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of goodies here. "The Ghoul" is not perfect, but it's worth watching.
