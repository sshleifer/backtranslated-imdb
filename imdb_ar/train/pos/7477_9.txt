This film is made up of these wonderful emotions, especially with the excellent soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his passion for film and entertainment. It was not the best film I first saw, but after about 3 more times, I decided that this was one of the best films I've ever seen. It happens in New York, and progresses through his lifestyle. Delimma discovers in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). Passes through a depression then a mix of old fantasy. This movie exceeded my expectations, and it is one of the best cruise films ever!
