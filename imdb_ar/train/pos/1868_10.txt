This film describes the life of a person who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people, he actually grew up to be a respectable person. What's more, this is a true story. <br /> <br /> Anton Fisher is so innocent but he was abused just because he was not white. Anton Fisher married the same women for ten years and was not deceived by women, coke, cigars, grass, alcohol or any of those things that were very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this film that it is excellent. The only rating I can provide is 10/10.
