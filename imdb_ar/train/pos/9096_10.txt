Exquisite! I saw the local import in Philly in October with my kids. We loved it so much that we saw it again with my father. I have not heard them laughing like this for years! This was the first time I remember watching a movie that my parents and kids could enjoy. It's really nice and we can not wait for it to appear on a DVD. They need to do more movies like Local Import. From refreshing to moving to a movie you can enjoy three different generations (and do not feel embarrassed). I have not seen a nice film since my grand wedding in Greece. I loved Mindy Stirling as a mother. They were also at Austin Powers. Howard Hessman in this too is a hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
