Wonderful! This is a good movie! The acting was not good at all, but if you look at some of the moments in the film, I get back and see it again, that's a genius! The man at the beginning of the film walks with his bag against three. I did not expect that. He then puts coke in a bag and runs away. I bet that the person who smoked against these three was one of his colleagues who later sold drugs. The genius quotes: '' Beautiful shades, I need your husband '' .. If you think you can take them .. '' .. Just wonderful! Fighting is the best I've ever seen. Look at the second man who comes down after hitting the head of the first man on the table. What a hit! In the middle of the film, one person was photographed in a car once, then the fall of three men, a really good shot. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The finish was wonderful, so exciting that James Kyle walks for 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoots Jason Peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls and rolls back and is dead! I can not say more words how wonderful this movie is!
