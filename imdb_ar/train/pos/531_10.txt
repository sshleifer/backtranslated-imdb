This film has the most beautiful opening sequence ever. I saw this film for the first time in a week, and since then I have seen every day of the opening and every time I feel so thrilled as I did the first time I heard David Neven talking in the timeless words of Sir Walter Raleigh's The Walgrimage: /> Give me clams of calm, my faith team to walk it, my serenity of joy, immortal diet, bottle of salvation, the dress of glory, the measure of true hope; thus I will take my argument (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know Why would it be self-evident to say that the life of Michael Powell and Emmerich Presperger is perfectly justified because she has made such a wonderful opening? Because they have already been admitted to the "Poet's Paradise" long before the film's production. <br /> <br /> I imagine that both of them are facing a trial on the Day of Resurrection and I say mercilessly to an angry God: Excuse me, sir. So, do you want to know what we did during our lives? Well, you will see well: We wrote and directed: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think this is enough, sir? It is clear to some extent that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty with God, nature, the museum, or anything that you might call when you shot a matter of life or death. The fact that others' lives are justified for their actions can not be obvious to all, although I feel that my life would make sense if I did not do anything else to watch this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, they will be tempted to say: They have not done such films anymore. Will be partially wrong. They have not made such films in the past. <br /> <br /> Kates has already been quoted here, but I will repeat his words: something of beauty is joy forever.
