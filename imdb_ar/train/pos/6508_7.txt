I grew up watching Scooby and I was a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can be tedious to viewers. Crooks in Mask becomes old and this cartoon is a change. It is not supposed to replace the Skopje gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers who I'm sure. The focus of the animation is on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large sum of money and are using the money to thwart the plans for the global invasion of the crazy world and its men. Small bands and gangs were distinguished themselves from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the connection between the boy and the modern dog, along with the jokes that come with him. Just enjoy Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so that this is not the last cartoon of Scooby.
