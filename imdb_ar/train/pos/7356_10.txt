If you do not see Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate Housewives at Home", you're missing. Eva will be one of Latina's biggest stars and you'll see her in the theaters soon. This was Eva's first film and she did a great job. She was 24 years old when she was shot and looked warm. For this low-budget film, it is good for the first director, which will soon be releasing Juarez, Mexico, which is currently on display in many film festivals throughout the United States. In fact, he seems to have a limited theatrical version of some news. What would be nice is seeing "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
