I just bought the restored version of a movie I remember with great emotion since childhood, and it certainly was set up for afternoon entertainment. Bedknobs is certainly more logical in its full form, and the deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) neatly link their events together. A little disturbing is how the scenes were reshaped. It is clear that the soundtrack of these footage has been lost or damaged, so some bright spark in Disney decided to portray the viewer with a new dialogue. Which would have been great except that half of the cast did not exist to do this (some for better reasons) and everything is of poor quality. Some very poor lip sync, and the sound of David Tomlinson called it bloke does not seem anything like David Tomlinson (in fact, there is a hint of German in it). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although "The Step in the Right Direction" is still absent) and the moments of magic in this film still shine. I challenge you not to laugh when little Paul looks at Angela Lansbury's innocence and his testimony. "But what does that have to do with my kisses?"
