Well, this movie was great. I do not think it was the best movie ever produced, but it was definitely fun. My brother and I still enjoy scenes from time to time, and sometimes we get out of the closet and blow up the dust and watch it to the end, but a wonderful concept. It is a film that one has to forget all criticism and just enjoy it. Judgment is the victory for the Jokes robot.
