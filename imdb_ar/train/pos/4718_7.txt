This film was made in Hungary I think. Anyway, the countryside is wonderful, people who play people were absolutely wonderful. Their joy is wonderful. I got more aboriginal, farm life, and how they were pirated they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who were looking for these paratroopers. They have sacrificed their lives in many cases. The young orphan boy who endorses Brady was a child who died. You will be amazed at the ride I think and work to try to evade the Nazis. It is amusing and comical in some locations and very tragic in other areas. Ladies have handy hankies, as they will destroy you in the end. I own it, and I have seen it several times. In other words, it is not just a single click. It is a guard ....
