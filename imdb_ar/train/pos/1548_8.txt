Luckily, I did not know anything about this film, I was curious enough to have a map of the TV. Then the tape ran out just five minutes from the end! <br /> <br /> I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really wonderful spy film. There are usual game submarines and little foggy plots, but also chilling and even bold moments. Considering the year of production 1969, some light lesbian tones should have raised some eyebrows. Of course now do not surprise anyone, and these scenes seem to be really beautiful. This is not only because of George's representations. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit all the scenes, no wonder, and certainly hit me. very Influential. Also the views of both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more depth along the thrill and usual action. This is not just a heroic war story by one victor, but it shows what lies behind victory in good and evil. Well, being a state of war, most of it is bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of composer Inyo Morikon, this is also necessary. His work is always excellent, and never before. I think I should try to capture more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon, so I can get the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with these very well-known gems.
