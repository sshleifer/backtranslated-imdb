This is one of the two or three short Stooges shorts, and no doubt that Christine McIntyre is the best performer with the trio. It's good in a number of short pants, but it is a very wonderful place. Singing is not funny at all, it's really frankly beautiful, but the plot is built in such a way that singing enhances humor rather than detracting from it. We listen to McIntyre singing the voice of the entire voice at least three times, but it does not progress in age, partly because we do not get tired of her voice, partly because it blends well with the strange Stooges. The use of comedy soprano reminds us of the role of Kitty Carlyle in the movie "Night at the Opera" by Marx Brothers, but the singing part of the comedy here much more than "Opera" and McIntier (perhaps more in the shows other than here) showed a special comedic talent Carlyle did not do it. Combining both Stooges' baroonery, McIntyre singing, and a well-built plot for 5 of 5 stars.
