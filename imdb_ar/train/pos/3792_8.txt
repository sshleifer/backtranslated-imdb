I watched this film earlier today and was amazed at the accuracy of the dialogue of the main characters. It was not like a movie - it felt like a documentary film (the part I liked most). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any 15-year-old girl I know. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very fun movie for those who enjoy independent movies.
