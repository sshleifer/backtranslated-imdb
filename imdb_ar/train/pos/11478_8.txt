Chris and Andre are ordinary ordinary teenagers. They were misunderstood by others and others. But they stand together and will pay everyone. Together they form the "two army". They plan and plan a "zero day". On that day, they decide to storm their high school and kill 14 people in cold blood. Through the tapes they produced "Zero Day", it is hardly a fantasy novel about the tragedy of Columbine. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Kick) do a good job so that their characters look like almost any deprived teenager walking down the street. Their performance was very reasonable, I kinda liked these guys and it was scary. Almost all of the video footage from the perspective of teenagers, "Zero Day," looks very real and correct, just like you. These children try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell them to you. But be careful, they follow the tragedy from start to finish and make it shocking and uncomfortable for some.
