I saw this film for the first time in my theater and drama class in Tulane. I was terrified by the beauty of this documentary. It is a sincere look at the ungraded reality of isolation. The family was wonderful and I thought they really showed Little Eddie in essence. ** As a side note, my teacher told me that throughout the filming, Little Eddie became fascinated by a camera man. ** Beauty, I find, comes from the natural nature of family dysfunction. It is clear in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither of them can work in the community on your own and begin to wish for Little Eddie's rehabilitation of society. Overall, the film touches on its aesthetic beauty and captures an amazing beauty. Two thumbs way!
