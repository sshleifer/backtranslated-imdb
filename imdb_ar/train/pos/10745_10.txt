Let me get rid of the bad situation first, that James Hanlon is very bad trying to describe what he was doing with the training of young people and events today. Indeed, it is in a strict contract with other firefighters without acting with natural ambitions in delivering them. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie impossible to watch without crying in my eyes. I am an English young man from London but I love New York and visited several times before and after September 11. It is a second home to me and I can only feel devastated by the loss of life, as well as the destruction of part of this amazing beautiful city. This is the real truth, with firefighters who collapse everything around them. I am very happy that the footage is there to show people how it was in the day. It is shameful that they did not use any footage of people jumping out of the buildings because the friends who were there told me that this is a big part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy organizers can go to hell by the way.
