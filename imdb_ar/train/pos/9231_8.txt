Flavia the Heretic is a curious introduction to this kind of prey - equal parts of corruption, feminism, and history as we follow Flavia in her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We started with Flavia in a monastery. She is not very happy with her existence because she does not believe in all male-dominated "rules" and the mechanical world of her surrounding world and escapes her monastery with her Jewish friend Ibrahim. Both were eventually arrested and Flavia was returned to the monastery where she joined another "non-believer" nun in speeding up an Islamic invasion. Flavia huddles with the Muslims who control the monastery and busy nuns in a strange group of scenes. In the end, the launching of the Muslim women and Flavia as a traitor to Christianity is punishable by another unique brutal scene. <br /> <br /> This film contains all the things I would like to see in a film from the 1970s. - Some good dresses, including nipple removal, the gentle sight of the leg, some decent nudity - including the entire front face required, and a decent story as well. I will say it was a bit pulled in a few points, but not enough to get really bored with it. I would definitely recommend this one to exploit the nunsploit / 70 fans ... 8/10
