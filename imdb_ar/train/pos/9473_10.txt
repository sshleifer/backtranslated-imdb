I was lucky enough to see it in a preview last night (October 20th) and was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and the real heart feeling of acting. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not too complex or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that looks new and unique, and clearly "Indy" in style. It's not something that can easily be compared to the movies of the past, it's a unique film about an old classic middle-aged love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly surprised by the film. And up to everything else in the family, was a wonderful team and talented. The three girls did a wonderful job, with the talent scattered evenly, neither of which was "superior" to the other two. <br /> <br /> It has been a really wonderful film suitable for all ages and funny laughing loud while being also really touching and warming heart. It was a wonderful break from sexual jokes and the nudity of modern films.
