This, the "hidden castle" is Kurosawa most dear to me. I do not give ten like dessert, but this is definitely worth it, if any. Although it is very long (like all Kurosawa movies), it has agreed to the problem that most of my films have bothered me. The storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving, with unnecessary scenes or too much relaxation without any real purpose to tell the story Or personal description. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience he did for example "Hidden Castle"; despite its length, there was not one minute I would like to take it out. <br /> <br /> This is also an unusual Kurosawa film in a way, it has no story, but many small independent stories that are based on more to describe the character than the story, unlike any other Kurosawa film I have seen so far. He also tends very much to the dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and the son who plans the "new house"). <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this one a masterpiece is still how to describe the subject as tragically as if it were humane and sympathetic, without pointing anyone at any time. From beginning to end, the emotional scale is fully presented from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
