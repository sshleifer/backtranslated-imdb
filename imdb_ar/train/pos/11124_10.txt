The SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Figure 1 - TV show of all time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought that this would be stupid and would not go beyond a trial episode. The Soprano has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the role of New Jersey's crime chief, Tony Soprano, with excellent actors. Eddie Falco is wonderful as a caring mother of the upper middle class. Tony Serico is a supporter of gray superstitions, which is often funny. <br /> <br /> While the show is often criticized for the negative stereotype of American Italians as a mafia, to be undeniable, I can see many of the pros of the show. Photography of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; can this be present in a rough TV show about gangsters? Yes really. In addition, other pressing issues such as terrorism, social inequality, injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. are discussed. This is not a shallow and boring spectacle of cruel men and violence. It has much more. Many of the problems we see in the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which was quite fascinating, has successfully penetrated existing issues and has been able to integrate them into the characters' lives, making the whole thing even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase who created an excellent TV treasure and James Gandolfini, to imagine, the most complex and mysterious television personality. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
