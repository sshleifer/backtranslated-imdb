Every child is traumatized as he grows up and the imagination of every child becomes active, but for Jake (Anthony de Marco of Clint Eastwood's next change - which resembles Henry Thomas around 1982), this deadly group may prove. <br /> <br /> A six-year-old boy, his imagination swings as he collapses to learn from his bickering parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, the late "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami") suddenly decided to divorce, Leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant? Zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jake sows this seed while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Justin), who provides him with a printed copy of the online FAQ about zombies. Jake convinced that one comes out of it ?? And his family ?? Hatching began a plan of action to protect them before it was too late. <br /> <br /> The newcomer to Indie Shelli Ryan ?? Who wrote and directed ?? Combines the local drama and the foundations of horror but the former (cleverly) surpasses the latter, with a decent story backed by good acting (Di Marco is a rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not acting) - all his subtle nuances are perfectly illustrated by the child, Bridges, his cheating wife, sympathizes with the realization that he really loves his son while Bloom has a more difficult task of building empathy as a somewhat lacking mother who is quick to get emotional because of rationality. It does not help when Dillon's mother Ruth (Monette McGrath, who resembles Laura Dern) feeds her implicit information constantly and leads a wedge between Jake and his father. Her manipulative personality is relatively popular, but she has shown in a scene that I will not go into details, but she explains why she is (and most importantly how she has also affected her child). <br /> <br /> The filler's personal camera also works well (many angles appear in Jake Bove's waistline or somewhat tending; a shot of Peter's inverted head carrying his son in the same place with some fun in the backyard) ), Editing is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan has relied on the personal experience scenario that has arisen as well as a direct witness of a friend who is going through the same situation and how the effects of adult relationships can be harmful if they cause their fears, anger and pressure on their children. Here the film is very successful in delivering its subject. <br /> <br /> However, the concepts of horror are a little disjointed to say the least, but the films of comedian George e Romero were lovingly honored by Ryan (Um Jake), who sleeps in front of the television, where NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD unspools, Causing his belief that the undead in their home). The metaphor of a monster acting as an alternative to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy but again, the child's fear of something under his bed is universal.
