Gandhi looks like a book presentation, chapter by chapter you read (with your eyes) and you can learn more about Harilal Gandhi and about this issue Kasturba Gandhi. Not much is known about them and the film describes them uniquely. The title is misleading though, it is a film about the engineer Gandhi Karamchand and his son as far as Harilal is about his mother. Akshay Khana and Shivali Shaya fully correct each other's roles. <br /> <br /> These films are similar to jumping years. They come only after a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi and my father also revolve around internal conflict, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom than ever before. If you like quality cinema.
