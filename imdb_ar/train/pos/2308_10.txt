I checked it as a motivation when browsing through a movie store and could not be surprised! My mother and I watched this film together, and we enjoyed it completely. It's not the typical "flick" that has a spoiled love story and tears all the way, but it certainly touches the nerve in that direction. It is the end where, although it is unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not affected by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was a fantastic actress even in this film, for the first time, and this is definitely worth watching! I did not realize many supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well. "Man in the Moon" is a believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. Most women can get involved in everything - from Witherspoon's words, her hidden looks and her imprecise emotions (raging like a traditional teenage girl). While she plays a confused personality about love, she does not encounter silly and immature, which was highly appreciated given the many movies today.
