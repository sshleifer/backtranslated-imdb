The arrival of a world famous conductor for unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way they deal with the church choir, and how people gradually change it. This movie is very sad and makes you leave the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about making the best in people. Kay Pollack has written an excellent screenplay based on his famous ideas. The actors are wonderful, Michael Nickfest we know before but Freda Halgren was a new and charming acquaintances to me. It has a more clear face that does not leave anyone touching it. Per Maubert is almost as good as Gabriela's husband, it's very bad. One only wishes to be chosen to play a nice person one day so that we can see if he is also proficient in this character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you. If you have not already seen it, do it today!
