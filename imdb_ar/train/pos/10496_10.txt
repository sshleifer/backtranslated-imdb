Great actors, Oscar nominated actress, stunning views, good strong story line, more laughter than you can put in my new handbag (which is very big). This movie was wonderful. He behaved beautifully in more serious scenes and funny moments. Well, split the side. I never heard the audience laughing a lot, and the tears were pouring down my cheeks during the scene of "ladies in the tea bar." Well done to the British film industry and Craig Ferguson whose magical components have been achieved from one of my favorite movies this year, if not at all.
