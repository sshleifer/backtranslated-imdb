The climax of two brilliant careers. David Lynch, known for less accessible materials, makes a delicate and fascinating story about the most likely hypothesis. A man travels to see his brother scatter. Due to the lack of other means of transport, his journey takes more than six weeks on the lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, has a spectacular stratigraphic performance. It's a wonderful story in its creation of small things, Straight Story is a classic film experience that should not be missed. Cisse Spike is the daughter of Farnsworth, a weak middle-aged woman who lives with her children.
