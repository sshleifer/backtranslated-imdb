I am Nicole Kidman fanatic. I will pay for seeing and hearing her reading the Moscow phone book, which, to my knowledge, might have been done when she spoke Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four basic principles are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes that you can not grasp. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this viewer asks a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (it's in parts) or very scary (it's in one scene) but the director does not seem to know which way to go.
