Tony Scott can make good and bad films, and I personally think he can be flashy and somewhat dirty, and obviously his work is suffering compared to his somewhat famous brother, but this may be his best film. What makes this film so wonderful is that Scott gives Denzel (in his incendiary form, the best of the day of training) and the revelation that is the time of Dakota Fanning to develop a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. The setting is not boring at all, although it takes some time - it involves it, and takes us on a small trip to the characters - including a wonderful role for her father Mitchell as her mother. All of this makes the procedure more effective, because we invest in personalities, for all very obvious weaknesses. This film has put you on the edge of the whole cliff, and it is not spreading at the end either. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film will be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have gotten a lot of Duff roles, when he is quite clear like any prominent man out there (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power on the screen these days). This film should have been huge, given its position, its performance, and the quality of the film. It only appears that if the studio does not return a movie to its maximum, it will end up directly to the video. I wish I had the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
