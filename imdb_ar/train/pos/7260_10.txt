Hi everyone I call Larissa, I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old, I watch a curly prosecution and I put on my socks to see this movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago, I just finished watching it. Alisan porter is a really good actor and I love this movie, it's very funny when dealing with cards. Every time I watch this film at its end, I cry so I said that I am only 13 years old, but this touching story is the fact that Alyssan is 25 years old. Every time I watch a film, someone is always young and shows the film one year after it was created and when you watch it and find out how old the person is in the film, it really becomes clearer how he can go from one age to another. next one. Such as Harry Potter. This film was also wonderful, but Daniel was almost 12 years old in the first film I was 11 years old. So how can he go from 12 to 16 years and just 4 years. I'm not sure if he is now 16 years old and I think he is almost 18 years old, but this is very strange when you look at one movie and the next day is about 4 years old, then you are when it was one year old at the last time. I'm not sure I'm a big fantasy and I love to hate. I'm kind of a computer person but I love to do lots of things for kids too. I'm very smart like a curly sue in a movie, but the only thing I do not like about the film is that when that adoptive guy contacts and causes a curly suit, I'll kill this guy if he has really done it in real life. . Well, I'll stop writing, I know how to write a lot sometimes, but kids have a lot of things to go out and if they do not, they will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
