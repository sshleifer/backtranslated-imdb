A fairly funny film featuring Jimmy Fox as a fast-paced, unhappy leader selected by US Treasury Secretary David Morse, who is demanding a release on the streets of New York to find a picky computer hacker / hacker (Doug Hutchinson) Forty-two million dollars from the treasury and two guards left by shot. <br /> <br /> "Taste" is the second feature of Antoine Foucault ("The Alternative Killers"), which is doing pretty well, even though it does not top his first film. What the films share is the sequence of events, which is absolutely excellent. <br /> <br /> Foxx is very good here although his character is annoying at first, but during the movie, I started picking on. Hutchinson is as wonderful as the mastermind as ruthless as John Malkovich and as patient as the late Laurence Olivier in the Man Marathon. Morse is fine as the agent who comes up with a master plan to get everyone who does it at all costs.
