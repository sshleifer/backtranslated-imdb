This amazing film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows China that I have not seen or imagined, and I think it shows China in the 1930s in the most real lights I saw in a film. It is very sad in many situations, where we see how difficult the lives of the characters, yet the story and the end is very happy. You really see the depths and existence of human presence in this film. The actors are all perfect, so you feel you have entered a really different world. <br /> <br /> I simply can not recommend this film enough. He may change you forever by seeing Him.
