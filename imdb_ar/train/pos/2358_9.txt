"Push Daisies" is just a beautiful fairy tale, with aesthetic and romantic shades "Amelie". She has a beautiful painting, her lessons studied and detailed, her names and conversations are eccentric and very gentle to be true, her imagination is wonderful, and her romance is deep. <br /> <br /> See the blue sky. Abroad, where blue can not be found in the rest of the groups or stills (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> See a completely natural and satisfying song that breaks out of a scene. <br /> <br /> The result was great, and her team is very loved, there is great music, and the leading romantic stars can not touch each other or die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (In fact, I wish they could find a way to overcome this, but can not compete). <br /> <br /> It's just a show that it's a pleasure to spend an hour with this and I highly recommend it. There was no other TV I completely like and I would like to see more. It made me go through one week of crappy flu, because it makes a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
