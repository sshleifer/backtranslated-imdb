This film about development. People grow and people fade, people surprise and people are disappointing. She has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It's really a classic drama that offers great performances from the cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her first role. <br /> <br /> This movie made me feel human and proud, and I suggest that this film should be mandatory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your sympathy. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Note: I admit this: I have tears of joy during the last scene.
