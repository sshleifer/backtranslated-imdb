Andy Goldsworth is a first-rate master of Taoism, expressing the way through his ephemeral art. In fact, time and change is essentially what is going on around it. I bought his first book several years ago, and my family has been amazed at it many times. So it was good to get to know the artist personally through this film. He is as patient and gentle as you would expect, and he has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, which is expressed deeper in his inability sometimes to say in words at all. It is like most children playing outdoors on their own (if they do it anymore), creating things from sticks, sand, mud and snow before they outdo it. Mr. Goldsworth has been given the gift and the task of expanding this type of play to create deep insights into nature and to open our often exhausted eyes with wonderful new ways. Always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of wandering around, and wondering monk.
