When the B movies go, it was much higher than average (I now warn the reader that I may reveal some key elements of the scheme or other parts of the film, although I try to minimize any such trend). Over time, it was great (despite the "cookie cut" approach in trying to copy certain elements of the original movie character.) Despite this sometimes difficult trend, he seemed to be working in this particular film, The viewer was distracted from comparisons with the original "scanners." <br /> <br /> The film was similar in ways of the Superman series, in terms of describing the main character of his early childhood and his relationship with his parents (who looked like Kents in " Superman ") and the theme of the immaculately immortal hero who possesses exceptional powers from an early age, and so on Miracle of isolation from miracles or otherwise In a different way, the compatibility of children, adolescents and / or adults was a subject that reminded me of films such as "Real Genius" and (more superficially) "Doctor Mordrid" and struck a very strong tendon. > The film was a positive messag e, and it was fun to watch.I found some ideas and accuracy (in terms of portraying certain aspects of paranormal experiences) and even wonderful touching sometimes.There were occasional moments of all the greatest headaches and undue sex (The quality, in this case, where the sexual elements were tastefully finished) and the violence that makes B movies (or Shakespearean plays, therefore!) The fun of the viewer ! <br /> <br /> This is a must see for all picture books, sci-fi, amateur "remote viewing", and horror lovers! With the right exposure in the right circles, the film can develop a very follow-up set, along with the original "scanners".
