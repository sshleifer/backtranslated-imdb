It's funny work, film review. In these days when "inner feelings" and "emotional separation" are preferred to express feelings, it must be difficult to remain loyal to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after completing the duties of the jury at the 58th session of Bernal, I was able to arrest Capi Yuji Yamada. <br /> <br /> After the show, I saw people dreaming as they walked out of the theater and watched them, men, ladies and reviewers alike. Even the director of Berlinal, who was clearly opposed to a hardliner of cinema, admitted that he had been caught without knowledge and found himself weeping on his way to three quarters of the way in this shameless emotional experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the reviews that came after. Although the film did not move much, many reviewers chose to be lukewarm and unemotional in their writing. Apparently, after crying, they put "roof thinking", and thus lost what I felt is a genius around my cape. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> The story of Kaby's story in Japan before the war revolves around the family and fate of a single writer after being held in prison for what he described as "intellectual crimes" against imperial will. Through a series of long-term emotional scenes, Yamada introduces us to the man, his wife and his two daughters, as well as three side figures, the sister of the beautiful young man, the humble former student, and nearly his uncle. ? They all come to help the family overcome their ordeal, in the absence of a man's home. <br /> <br /> The story progresses at a slow but steady pace, and heart ache occurs at moments when everyone can. To predict. This of course makes it impossible for anyone of the audience to be struck by the emotional amazement of any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although you are learning family love and their aides, sympathizing with their unfortunate attitude, you feel very upset by the confirmed plot so that you find yourself expecting a certain kind of end. <br /> <br /> However, two hours after the movie (do not worry, Yamada provides the viewer with enough moments of attraction and luxury), applauds what I can only describe as "sting." All I assumed was what the story was about? An innocent man is disturbed by his believing wife and daughters? Now suddenly refers to a family aide. Someone that you have considered so far is now being taken for granted in an unexpected evolution of destiny. <br /> <br /> At this point, something strange happened in the theater where I was. Everyone began to sob uncontrollably. /> <br /> "My words!" Mumbling under my breath. I was struck by the fact that "Kabei", in the final analysis, was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the brink of war. In fact, this was an accurate test of one of the common human beings: how interested we were in the secret feelings of those closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now, the most common criticism about the film was that it was technically strong, but lacked innovation. This is what happens when reviewers put their hat thinking ideal, I think. With Kabei, I think Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he would use to touch on a unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick he applied smoothly in the Tora-san series, and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After calming the audience in a kind of narrative comfort zone, we are thrown into a world of emotions rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the most effective cinematic instrument ever. One avoids discovery but it affects you strongly. Proof of its effectiveness was a thousand pieces of Kleenex moist, dumped in a dustbin outside the cinema hall, which accommodates a thousand people. <br /> <br /> Now if some critics only resist being smart, they forget the reality of cinema. Human emotions. Simple and pure.
