I can remember this film when I was a little boy, I loved it then and still do it now. I was able to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was happy because I found it very hard to find it in advance and I was only hired when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of interesting songs and music. Fantastic animation and perfect personality sounds. It was always for me, but I think if I did not watch the movie when I was young, I would not find it as wonderful and wonderful as I do, although I still think I still like it because I'm really in the movies.
