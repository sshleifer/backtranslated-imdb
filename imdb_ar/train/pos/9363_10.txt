This film was amazing, it's the kind of movie you're watching, and instead of looking at other films by the actor you're looking at in other director / writer films. Sandler did a good job working out a character outside his comfort zone and the good Cheadle always did a great job as well. This movie is awesome for a mature mature audience. The acting was wonderful and could only be surpassed by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on real Americans, the last generation, not stereotypes or racism, only the people who met and realized the true meaning of life. This film revolves around loss and dealing. Instead of choosing a psychiatrist, he knows him, not the person who treats you magically, but the need to talk about your feelings to a neutral person you do not trust, will not judge you, but will guide you despite your thoughts. This movie is all amazing tour!
