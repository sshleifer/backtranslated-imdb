I can not believe they took off this air. Especially, when they had a few remaining rings only. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. We were very upset when they stopped showing it because of the so-called assessments. It is not fair to people who have been watching this show from the start. We had the right to see the end. I hope that they will take a general vote of all people with a three-year voting system. They can send mail and as a viewer we can make a comprehensive vote on all the programs we see or hear about. This can also help in promoting a new display. People will see it and ask what it is. You can not only see what viewers are watching, but you can also use this as a free advertising tool for TV and cable channels. Want to see other episodes. Prepare it !!
