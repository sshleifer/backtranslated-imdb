I enjoyed this movie. He was very rude, pleasant and colorful. You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. Each scene is packed full. Choreography was great. Jane Kelly is a wonder. He's very talented. All dance numbers in this film are performed perfectly, and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last part of the film, the great dance sequence, is impressive. What makes this film so special is the Gershwin music. Few American composers have a better gift for the melody. I enjoy the music of Gershwin. It is a magician. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He's very clever and charming. This movie was very entertaining.
