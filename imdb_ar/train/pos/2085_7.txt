When Lung and his wife O-Lan finally achieved financial success after years of famine and poverty, they found a life full of possessions but lacking meaning. Only when they return to the ground after fighting from a swarm of locusts (the special effects used in their creation are still incredible and beautiful to watch them) they discover they meet again. There is a common formula that is listed from a unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially 1937) that makes the film a classic. Money is not worth anything without friends and family, a point the film leads home completely in the last 10 minutes of its emotional end.
