In what is considered the best outdoor adventure film ever, four of the city's youth face the fury of nature, in the story of survival. The setting is Georgia's forests, forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Burman, has chosen to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals drink the film deeply from the unmatched description in the film's history. No important "representatives" can get close to approaching the faces, voices or actions of these people. I do not remember a film in which secondary characters are very realistic and colorful. As is the case with anything else, bold realism is what makes this film so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another power is the theme of the film. Nature, in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be South America. Very few places in the United States, or were, as violent as the underdeveloped country. In a story about Darwinist survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from them. <br /> <br /> "Salvation" is the product of his time, unlike today, the Americans expressed concern about the fading wilderness. The wonderful landscapes of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, cockroaches, the roar of river slopes, along with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. This is another force of film. <br /> <br /> On the entertainment level, tension is gradually rising as the plot progresses. Even halfway to the film, the tension becomes intense, and therefore never recedes, nor until the final credits expire. Very few films can maintain this level of intensity along this long period of plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's artistic quality is the top quality. Direction and editing are flawless. Excellent cinematography. Dialogue is interesting. The representation is wonderful. Bert Reynolds was never the best. Ned Betty casts perfectly and does a good job. John Voight was nominated for the Oscars. If there is a weak link in the film, this is the music that interests me shyly. <br /> <br /> In general, "Delivery" will certainly attract viewers who love outdoor adventure. Even for those who do not, bold profiling, representation and plot tension are enough reasons to watch this film, one of the best movies in the history of cinema.
