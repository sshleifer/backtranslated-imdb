I saw this picture in 1940 for $ 11 and wanted to get a DVD in 2006. The film was the greatest adventure of the time, and as with all epics, it is still a marvel of entertainment (B & W and everything). A real friendship is linked to the chemistry between the actors and the performance of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli is fantastic (this can not be done today especially I liked the end where the colonel read the end of Kepling's poem on the body of Gunga Dean and told "Untouchable" "You're a better man than me Gunga Dean" The only member of the acting team that is still present is Joan Fontaine
