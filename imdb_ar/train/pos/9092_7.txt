I think this film adds to diversity and is very accurate with regard to historical reconstruction. The way in which different communities emerge together in Thailand is very exciting ... the Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities run by the king. The plots around the court are as usual a power struggle with much treason. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in reasonable production. The scene with elefant as very interesting porters. It is interesting and I think it can also be used in schools because of its historical accuracy because it shows that the Europeans in Asia were kings of local kings in a very different way from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
