This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Shots are unusual, sometimes mesmerizing. She also won an Oscar for best photography, and she deserves it. I have many films in my film collection and many other films I've seen beside them, not many of them more beautiful or even equally beautiful like this movie. <br /> <br /> A movie. The actors are wonderful and do a great job of photographing their characters. We pursue their destinies with dedication, and join them emotionally. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot of this film is what it represents and how it is presented. I highly recommend it
