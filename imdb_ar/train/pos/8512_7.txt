I can tell you how bad this film is. I was in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but I imagine the idea that anyone actually pays to see me drunk. Especially given what we did that year. The thing is they're probably over edited. Especially the scene in which my roommate had coke the breast from a Mexican whore (perhaps they should have followed him in the place). We have made some appearances that come and go, but besides, I can not remember anything. What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew because he wanted to remember him as the person who threw or the girl who showed her nipples to the world (or the girl who lost her virginity to) and generally the trip itself was crazy but People act differently when the camera is on them.
