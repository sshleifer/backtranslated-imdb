I found this movie on the cable and I was completely hooked. The story of a group of surfers riding the big waves, the huge waves, the waves that will make any sane person escape the horror is a story that can be amazing and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing the waves. There is nothing special about the film, except that it brings together some very interesting people who love what they do and let them talk. Sure, there are scenes from them, but what makes this film so special is people. Here's a group of very enthusiastic men who do what they do to express to the people who watch them. Halfway to this movie, you'll want to go out and learn to surf the internet as well. Only a few documentaries have excited the passion of these people and the ability of films to make us feel that it makes this film great. Look.
