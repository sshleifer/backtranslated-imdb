There are some spoilers in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Jodson Mills, but I'm also a fan of Chuck Norris, and while I admit that some of the motion scenes may have extended to a certain extent, the story is in line with the other weekly series being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The opening period was fifteen minutes with Deke, who ran away from the bad guys after the bombing of their rockets filled with excitement. I do not understand how many "professionals" could not reach a moving goal, but the procedure was certainly there, and Dick, as a hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> As for the comment about the need to "get the film in the can to fill the interval after the playoffs." This film was originally not identified by CBS to broadcast the broadcast in January and was completed in May 2001, four months before the terrorist attacks against the US <br /> <br /> If the commentator had For the film instead of trying to avoid it, they may have realized the story plot: Rashid, bin Laden's character, plans to blow up a nuclear device in the United States. "President Man" was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> A writer may have to watch the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
