This is without doubt one of the most extreme films ever produced. Amitabh as a gourd country, Arjun Singh, hilarious. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is an old story of the same age where a child is separated from a mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion in the end. There are the bad guys (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are foxes (Parvin Babi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and his soul gave him well. But this movie revolves around Amitabh and that's all you remember at the time. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and continue dialogue with him and his behaviors are joyous. Later in the film turns into the angry young man who is famous for him but the humor remains. The memorable parts include walking, talking and speaking in English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with Dadu. <br /> <br /> In general, I was walking around with laughter throughout the film. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its absolute best - this is it. Will give it easily 10/10.
