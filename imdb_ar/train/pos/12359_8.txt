It is worth noting that it is a notorious scene when Maruschka takes the wonderful Detmers rod of her little boyfriend from his panties and in her mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a wonderfully exciting journey. Drummers perform a great performance such as partially unsaturated glamor, which roams around its flat nakedness. Dressed in naked and bare clothes, she wears the bulk of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the other two victims are lost a little, and the end is very confusing when the fiancee is released during the release of her fellow terrorists, and she seems unsure of what she wants and the young lover looks more interested in his exams than she is crying, of course beautiful!
