I loved the horses and liked the hand-drawn animation, so I did not expect anything surprising from Dreamworks's new animated film: Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I think you can say I was a bit disappointed. You have a fantastic animation and at first it sounds like a perfect story. The story of nothing at all except a horse in nature. Animals do not sing nice songs or even talk - it's a great feature, unfortunately, the film is unparalleled to Matt Damon's novel. Fantastic soundtrack from Brian Adams. And enough motion scenes to compare them with Jerry Prokheimer's production. If movie makers have just stayed with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it is a good entertainment for young children. I would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place, which is the only thing that exists at the moment that does not offend young children. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very beautiful photos though.
