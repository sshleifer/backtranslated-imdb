This will keep one very short. I think this is an exceptional film. I see other reviewers who commented that it was badly written, badly shot, had a terrible audio clip, and worse, that it was not real in his portrayal of life. Well, so it may not be quite acceptable for his height, but this film carries a message of hope that others seem to have missed. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gang violence is real, is not it? Is that true, no! This film carries an important social message that may not be hated by pessimists but is nevertheless commendable, rather than distorted. I have watched this movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that it can make the world better and do not exceed saving (well, not until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 for me this one. It is almost perfect in my view. JMV
