In short, but long enough, Cat soup is a very wild trip to watch. One day, I was just looking through my request list through the animation section and I saw it and decided to watch it. I spent most of the time sitting basically with my jaw. All the time I was either free to think, or I had a fleeting idea I shouted "turn it off !!!". But I did not. In fact, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally liked it because of the amazing animation, but the story that seems to be behind it is equally convincing. <br /> <br /> A little boy - well, a cat - is looking for the soul of his sister. In the first part, she was sick in bed, and was soon paid by visiting a kind of grimy cassette. Her spirit was divided into two halves. One is retrieved by the cat boy while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then I lost the rest of the movie a bit bluntly. I expect them to return, and their world ... may collapse slowly? Perhaps the absence of her soul is the answer behind it, the rest of the film contains different stages, including the world. First, there is a huge flood, then dry in a dark desert, then freezes everything (thanks to whatever God or Destiny, as you will see). Then I think they found the sister spirit in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, I did not quite understand it, but it sends shivers down the spine every time. <br /> <br /> Although they seem to be random scenes, I'm sure there is a deeper message behind them if you see them enough and do some research. Personally I love triple things like this, and I love spending time doing it just to understand it. But for some people, perhaps their cup of tea is not. It's very annoying, so if you love anime anime straight, this is not a movie for you. If you have an open mind, I highly recommend this film.
