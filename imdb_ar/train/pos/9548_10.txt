It is an excellent film from Turkey that can make sense. Wonderful work of brothers Gokbakar. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to refer to playing on the screen. Overall, it is not enough to run the screen in most films from Turkey, but GEN has the best shots that can be said "perfect". As well as the really excellent transition parts. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a great theme that affects everyone. Who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium, has a mother who is the usual madness. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is combine all the hints. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggressive part by Doja Rutkai and Sahan Jockbacker. This performance may be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll feel confused"
