Andy McDowell's facial expressions are wonderful again in this film. When you enter the 40 and be single for a period (or throughout your life) you may feel wasted. The movie is a beautiful reminder that love can be found anywhere if the antennas are very active. I liked the rapid sexual confrontation, which must be outside the character of a normally reserved teacher (MacDowell). Her former student is nice enough and still holds a crush on his mentor for a long time. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought were unrealistic or somewhat impractical. For example, in a scene where the other jealousy of women has gone awry and a scene has been set up to make Andy McDowell abandon the young man, does a mature police officer (another friend of McDowell) allow her friend to do such a wicked act? Is it so easy that no one stops in front of the car? Of course the accidents happen all the time, but I hope to see the heroine marry happily with the first man she was involved with (it was the hardest part you believe!) For that beautiful woman to stay single for a long time ??) <br /> <br /> Maybe Movie producers realize the fact that much romance between an old woman and a younger man does not last long. They also know that the happy ending will not appeal to the public, especially the jealous women over the age of 40, who are waiting for some miracles. The sad end with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who has lost her true sweet love, but if the man continues to live, will it continue? till when? no one knows. However, it's a film that makes you want to see it again later .... maybe a year later.
