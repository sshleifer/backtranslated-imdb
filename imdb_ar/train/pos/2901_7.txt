Tiempo de Valientes caters to the wonderful movie genre of his friends, but it transcends its roots thanks to the excellent representation, the tremendous connection between the filaments and the wonderful photography. Diego Preetti plays Dr. Silverstein, a gun-wielding player with Detective Diaz Luis Loki, who was charged with investigating the killing of two small capsules that appear to have been involved in the arms smuggling plot. Diaz has been suspended from service, but he is the best man in this position and must receive professional psychological help until he is returned. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves involved in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and some uranium. The film divides them at a crucial stage that allows Silverstein to develop some of his impressive skills. Peretti and Luque both have the same privilege and remind me of Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not classically handsome like Hill. Remarkably, even in about two hours that Tiempo de Valientes does not like to be welcomed, but the writer and director Damien Zephron puts a possible sequel in the film the magician. All in all, a wonderful comedy and very entertaining does not suit the lowest common denominator and do not insult your intelligence.
