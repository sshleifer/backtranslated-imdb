Netflix should mention this short feature on Silk Stockings information. Superior in every way so excessive fluff production. This was much better than Cool Porter songs and lots of energy. Silk stockings turned into a huge disappointment. Fred was older in age for this kind of thing, although the dances and Cyd were pretty. I will be waiting for the Garbo-Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Laurie sick while making silk stockings - seems to have been very negative in the most active numbers and less lines? Very happy because I ran across Barry-Barry through a pure accident. Make the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a mere "dance and singing man" is pure joy.
