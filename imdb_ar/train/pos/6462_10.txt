I will not spoil the contents of anyone, has not yet seen this modest masterpiece by Kay Pollack. <br /> <br /> A world-renowned conductor brilliantly by Michael Nickvist seeks peace from stress by returning to his childhood village. Villagers, who follow the genius in silence, slowly seduce him to share his greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a very specific purpose and shows remarkable potential in each of the actors playing a chord in short but precise words, the Symphony of Love. <br /> <br /> Love is not the sense of relationship, but the tone of the soul buried deep inside each of the characters, each revealing itself to the current story, their needs, their skeletons, their desires and much more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention the two main parts played by Freda Halgren and Michael Nickvist, who played their dramas in memorable interchanges between emotional reactions. They touch each other with pain associated with their inability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nickvist has already been tested here in a very difficult setting, in one of those films that ends up being disastrous or wonderful. And wonderful, it's from start to finish, not less than one second or more than enough, you leave a sense of change and more taste. <br /> <br /> To this day, definitely one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
