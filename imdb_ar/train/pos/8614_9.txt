The film is my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some other publications on the grounds that this plot was not crooked. I had no problem keeping up with him (maybe some people were being bullied the night before). The film was very sad and touching too. what do you want more? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott is doing great work for him too. The relationship between the mother and her daughter may have been somewhat unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the film was not. He was sadly sad but enlightening. He certainly beat other programs that were on TV on New Year's Day
