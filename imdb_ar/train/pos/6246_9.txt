It is not a great idea to see Hundstage if you are not quite sure of your mental stability, because it will be heavily tested with this film regardless of how well your mind is. I must say that Hundstage is a technical film and not an entertainment film, so the majority of viewers will not enjoy the "maturity" to reach their wonderful side. Kind of like Tarkovsky films, but somehow different. Personally I can not say that I enjoyed watching it so much. But it is a wonderful experience and very interesting for those who are tormented by Hollywood's vulgarism. Hundstage sticks the finger right into your mind and deceives your mind everywhere. You can not simply sit and watch it, use exclamation marks or look with wide-eyed eyes throughout the movie. A film similar to this in style is Nachtgestalten, but it was much better, and less violent. This is for example, not for children or for those with mental or bad mood. Most viewers are likely to offer 10 or 1 for this movie. I give it number 9 because I saw the phenomenon of multi-story film in another film and it was the best. But this one piece is outstanding on its own. Worth watching, but be prepared to see something disturbing.
