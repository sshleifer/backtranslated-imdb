This is a really funny film (and sexy) - this is not only ridiculous, but it has a wonderful representation. It's a kind of film where characters are so entertaining that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival, and I found myself laughing a lot loudly with anyone else, and I was also affected by some of the most dangerous parts of the film. It's a unique film about two doctors, I do not want to give up anything, but there are some very powerful scenes and scenes - and the dialogue is wonderful. The character of Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mia are funny and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - go - I will not be disappointed. It's worth watching again. Wood Harris deserves an award.
