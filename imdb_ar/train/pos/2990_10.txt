I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars, but unlike his book, I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three themes included in most romantic stories or great shared movies). <br /> <br /> Here the main topic is dividing the row. Stella is a story of the American Depression era. However, it was translated into the screen and then in a memorable way that this new version (if you asked a fan in Stanwyck or two) was not entirely appreciated. Fans of the original did not give her a chance. Moreover, this version of Stella was manufactured in the 1990s, which is not exactly the time when he is suffering from a major financial problem in America (as he was depressed). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the pink glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and we see that this powerful story is still correct, timely and relevant as before, in its modern form. <br /> <br /> Yes, the class gap is the main theme here. Stella is among the working poor, one, with great dreams but little hope in realizing those dreams. She works in a bar, does not have much money, and lives in a wonderful apartment. You get drifting. In the morning, do not want to get out of bed. On its wall, pictures of the stars of the cinema you worship. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dancing in the bar. He is rich and educated from a high class family that does not share the Stella family. His main concern is what the University Ivy League to attend, her is how to pay rent, how to be "happy." They have an affair. they love each other. Stella ends the rack. Stella tells the guy the news. His reply? "What about abortion?" I replied, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." She gave us balloons and suggestion, but she sees that his heart is not in him, and he has great pride. They send it for packing. <br /> <br /> In the end, her daughter is torn between the two modes of life - the love she enjoys for her mother, the benefits, the happiness and the love that her rich father holds. Stella, alone and unpopular, does not want to become her daughter unhappy like her day, offering the ultimate sacrifice. She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure her daughter's happiness, and may live indirectly, hopefully, knowing that at least her daughter has found something to live for. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is right in it. The beautiful result, brilliant cinematography and brilliant design of the collection (the contrast between the two styles of life, the luxurious chaos and the ornate palaces), and the wonderful and hearty performances by the entire crew, with Bette Midler, in particular, Oscar deserve. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is far more important and well-made than you have been led to believe.
