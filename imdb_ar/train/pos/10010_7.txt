There are many diseases that are born in the human mind and which have given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accumulated information in the world of Pyschosis has made psychiatrists, counselors and psychiatrists busy enough to work for decades. Sometimes, some of this mental phenomenon is discovered by those who have no knowledge of their treatment or even their presence. This is the introduction to the film entitled "Night Listener". It tells the story of a famous radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends his evenings attracting audiences with live stories about gay lifestyles. Perhaps because his program loses an authentic crust making Nun confess that he is no longer the same. He feels abandoned by his mistress Jesse (Bobby Canaval) and his favorite friend Joe Morton, looking for shelter in his isolated desperation and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice at night asking him for help. The afternoon needs to feel useful and reach the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Kulkin). By reading the horrific child's scripts depicting early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Nun captures and wants to help. However, things are not apparently, and soon Nun finds himself enveloped in a distant and elusive tale torn directly from a medical nightmare. This film is free of Robin Williams, and if it were not for Tony Collett who plays Donna Lugand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Colom in pop music, this may be a comedy. Instead, this may prove to be one of William's most serious offerings. ***
