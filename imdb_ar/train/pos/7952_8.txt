This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved him when I was young and still carries me now that I have grown up. I still laugh at the same old jokes and have shed tears several times. I did not show much interest in the animals that spoke, or at least those with United Nations fees, but that animal I would defend. It is a fairly old film but it will always be a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other animal movies I can think of even at the moment I can compare them, let alone as much as this one. Maybe I give a lot of praise for this film but I do not think the show. I really carry this great message that says "home is the place where the heart is". Or at least this is the message I have gained from it. Definitely recommended for a good night old family movie.
