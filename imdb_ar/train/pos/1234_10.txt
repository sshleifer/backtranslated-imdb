I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it today as I was when I was a kid. Do not listen to the critic's remarks. It is not accurate in this film. Eddie Murphy really shines in her. You can sit with your entire family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend everyone to this movie. It's a comedy with a touch of imagination. With devils, dragons, and a small bald child with God like powers. This film takes you from Los Angeles to Tibet, to the stunning view of the magnificent temples of Tibet's mountains. nice view! So go do yourself a favor and grab this one up! You will not regret!
