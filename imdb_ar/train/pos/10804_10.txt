Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily moved to the canal that shows this at first. I brought the first film by the writer Bachilbel Hanjarati, and then the scene of the Tiger moth (produced by me, my grandfather and my father all) produced a slight moisture around the eyes and then the name Karo completely linked me. I have acquired this film, the performance of Crow (again), the theme (and yes, what religion we condemn), how things were handled and handled, and the flight sequences (Father Afro-Ansons also flew), the story - , Crow Recitation for High Flight. I will not spoil the film for anyone, but I separated from my wife with 4,000 miles, as a former army officer who was deployed in several wars and as a private pilot, I confess to crying warmly several times. Buy, rent, download, beg, borrow, or steal - but watch it. <br /> <br /> Note: Have you spied on Bristol Blenheim (yellow training colors) on the ground? It resembles a two-engine aircraft with Browning-0.33 in the dorsal tower.
