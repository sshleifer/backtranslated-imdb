I grew up with this favorite film all the time. The incredible special effects of the era, won prizes. I can remember dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It is simply a wonderful adventure for all time. The music is written by Michele Rosa, who is the best film history. Sabo is a thief. Conrad Vedt is the great villain. I have a copy at hand, for the next trip down the memory lane. Stand there! Rex Ingram wants to get out of his poverty!
