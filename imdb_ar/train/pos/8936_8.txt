After "Beau travail", everyone was waiting for Claire Dennis to do a masterpiece of follow-up that never came. Now she has. Dennis makes a huge leap in this film, a collection of brilliant films, elliptical editing, and mysterious narrative events that feel odd and strange. There is a symbolic conspiracy (derived in part from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same name) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant and is sought by the son of Tahiti for a long time; but often explores the idea of ​​personal and cultural breakthroughs. It takes a few times for the viewer to fully understand them and has problems closing close to the end, but it's still more sophisticated and more sweeping than anything else I've seen this year. I miss her at your own risk.
