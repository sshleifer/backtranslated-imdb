Elvira Mistress of the Dark is a wonderful collection of fun, sex appeal, horror and comedy all flowing into a low black dress with a swollen black sky. This movie will certainly delight any Elvira's fan. It takes you to the Sapphire and a character with Elvira and probes deep into her ... The Mother of the Past reveals her enormous predecessors ... <br /> <br /> The movie takes you on a journey with Elvira and she goes from TV Horror Hostess with Mostess to her birthplace in Fallwell Mass To claim her legacy from the deceased great aunt. Where a crowded city, a wonderful cinema owner, encounters a great creeping uncle who seems to take care of her more than her beautiful appearance. A large number of high school children who like it immediately, and the city council will do anything to take it out of the city, even if it means burning it to the test! Elvira watched as she attracted children, chased the wedding, avoided her crawling skeletal uncle, and poked her nose into the delicate "preservatives" with no nice words, in Elvira Mistress of the Dark! <br /> <br /> As Elvira says, "I'm sure it'll be a scream!" Well, good thing, I did not say it would be gas!
