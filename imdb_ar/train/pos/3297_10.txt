A final tribute to a great film actress. The film is a poetic masterpiece on the screen. Like great hair it does not extend forever. Direction, acting, screenplay, music, lyrics, in fact all film industry standards are chosen to suit the film's message. This Muslim community in India has never been given such respect, nobility and reality. This scenario can not be forgotten in the hands of Mena, Ashok, Raj Kumar, Nadira, etc. For example, but not limited. I was impressed by its unique appearance, Kamal Kapoor. Permanent legacy of filmmaker Kamal Amrohi to the subcontinent. A very beautiful film about a controversial subject that makes humanity look at the face of untouchables in the world and face them. "In Ka Yes? Pakeeza! Haan Pakeza." This representation is unknown in the age of sex, dance and pornography.
