A very funny comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who were invited to return to spend a week at Camp Tomoca (Ontario) Canada by their former adviser Alan Arkin). The writer / director Mike Binder benefited from his experience in the camp itself as a major source for producing a nice yarn and logical understanding. Also, the film contains a lot of funny moments, some of them quite strange like my favorite, and the film includes the use of adhesive tape. Newton Thomas Siegel ("The Usual Suspects", "The Three Kings") presents the film with some impressive footage from the Canadian wilderness. Among the actors, Sam Remy, director of the films "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as a man holding Arkin. Another thing, this film reassured me that the camp should not be the site of bloody killings.
