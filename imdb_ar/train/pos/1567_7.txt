It's not a very bad movie, with Sanders, Barry, Hill, Queen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we may be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint. Get a chance to spend another hour with some old friends, easy to polite, kill and kill - is always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barry is a heavily armed lady to avenge her father and clear her framed death, a police informant by planning and carrying out a clique with her series of assassinations of the underworld. Which certainly had an opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun simply by dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on him and the first killer (in time!) And killing him. <br /> <br /> Story and representation Well, the only handle I have is near the end with the quick and funny discovery of the evil genius (and the demon) - have they forgotten about its importance in the plot? That said, a strong entry into the chain.
