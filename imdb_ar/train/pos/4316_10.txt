I must say Grand Canyon is one of the most influential films I have ever seen. I have seen it several times now and I still feel as I did the first time; that this film, in itself, can constitute the entire curriculum for a postgraduate course in film direction. <br /> <br /> Movie trailers have long been used as a promise, "It will make you laugh, it will make you cry." This is a vulgar way to describe what Grand Canyon is doing. Takes you to the best places in human experience, and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is frequently moved between people who are close to happiness and those who approach terror. It's always a short step, too. Just to manage this swing with grace and without making it seem false or exaggerated is a guiding genius. <br /> <br /> The spoiler (s) coming. After the audience gets used to swinging back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve in a sequence that does not move from good to bad and back, but instead escalates from a normal husband conflict, through a self-injurious sacrificial knife that may or may not require stitches. To escape the characters from home at the moment of satisfaction, forgotten the controversy and forgot the finger and survived the earthquake, and called a neighboring woman to collapse her elderly husband. The couple rush to help him. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw her. I am crying now. It is not sadness that does this to me. It's not a particularly sad sequence. What bothers me is that these few minutes of the film were perfect. That's perfect! just awesome. (End spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's a lot to say about the Grand Canyon. It depicts ordinary people suffering from epiphany and allows the viewer to experience them indirectly. They are not exhilarating or overpriced and there is no long stop to check the moment carefully. The film moves in the pace of life. Even when the characters try to understand what has happened, they are not sure what to draw from their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human film.
