Older Watch ???? I am 15 years old and have watched the show since I was 12 years old and re-encoded on my Sky + box daily from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they had not canceled it, so they did not get a good farewell. But what this adventure, all those episodes, I think I saw all of them, and no one comes to mind that I did not like and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the BBC continues to swap the diagnoses. Murder and "murder you wrote" - I never saw him and did not intend to do. In any case, his characters in the murder program are very in-depth, and the chemistry among the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled this offer ........
