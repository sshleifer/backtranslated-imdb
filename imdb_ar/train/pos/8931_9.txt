The Intruder (L'Intrus), directed by French director Claire Denis, is the film's editor. He follows his own spirit through time, space and personality. There may be a conspiracy, but what I understand is that I was picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD cover. Frankly, it may be best to know anything about the film before watching it, because then the viewer can set aside all expectations. The film asks the viewer to think, but he also underestimates the fact that he will not fully understand. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the mystery of the movie. Every picture wonders about its role, nature and shape. The heart is an intruder, that viewer and Louis. Lewis's character was played by Michelle Sopour with the peace and mystery that this character requires. Frankly, anyone can play the character of Lewis, if he has a roving, willing and comfortable heart. After Subor is the one featured here. The film becomes an integral part of it. Many of the film's lingering images revolve around my mind, its vocal, but essentially physical expressions. <br /> <br /> The intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the silence and completeness of the movement, but more flexible than any literature in the form you reject. The term "surreal" was a term used to describe this film, but the term "semi-realistic" might be a more appropriate term. There is nothing in the film that exists outside the possibilities of reality; the simple result everywhere confirms that it is by visualizing the relationship between heartbeat and dim light in music. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer several times if you are attracted to visual images; see the movie to see the consequences of a combination of verse and comprehension for freedom.
