This production of Oliver is masterful in showing evil layers in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly invisible invisible figure who penetrates this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the most dangerous dangers safely into the hands of his relative. Yes, although Oliver walks in the valley of the shadow of death, he does not fear evil. The rod and staff are there for his comfort. In the end, he is saved from human stupidity. At the bottom, Vagin, the most wicked of many. He does not think of repenting in his ways once, but twice, but he backs down because he is not willing to pay the price. Vagin is worse than Bill Sykes, because he raises a few pickpockets who become killers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is not polluted, but has not been tried. Best Nancy. Lacks governance, and ignores the violent nature of Bill Sykes because of her deep need for love. But unlike Vagin, at the expense of the potential cost of her life, she repents for her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability. I would like to give this film "10", but his music video in the seventies and his audio equipment was distracting. In general, a wonderful story and story perfectly suited to all audiences.
