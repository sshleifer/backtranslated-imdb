Why do people make fun of this film and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest film of the 21st century. With wonderful representation, directing, impact, music and everything in general. This movie is always thrown by everyone because one day someone said they did not like them yet, so most of the world decided to approve it. There is nothing wrong with this film. All I can say is that this is not just the most Oscar-winning movie of all time, and it's the biggest ever, and unfortunately one of the most I've ever seen. Apart from that, it is really the best movie of all time. The only films that are close to being like All Star Wars, Triple Lord of the Rings or anything by the masters of Hitchcock, Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but nothing suits James Cameron Masterpiece TITANIC.
