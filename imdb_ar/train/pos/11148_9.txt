Midnight Cowboy X was rated with the original version back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand it, just a little bit. The film about Joe Buck (John Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become an impostor raises some concern at times. He wears cowboy clothes as he tries to live as a healer, and gets money by doing love. It does not work as planned. After a man named Riko Ratsu-Rizo (Dustin Hoffman) pulled a trick on him first and stole some of the money they became friends with. They live in an empty apartment and very dirty. Ratsu then gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the film has been classified as "X" for the main theme but in the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is wonderful. We see dream sequences of Joe and Ratso intersected by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, John Voight and supporting actors make great performances. Special Hofmann delivers some famous fine lines. The result is by John Barry and looks great. All this makes this film great and won the best Oscar movie for good reason.
