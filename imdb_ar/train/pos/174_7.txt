Sunny, the cocktail waitress in the metropolitan area, a bit dim, put in mild. She drives an old car and rents a small room from a male homosexual couple. However, it saves a prominent Arab life, by taking a bullet in the back that was reserved for the official. She charms the national press with her zany remarks and sweet looks. Inhaling a chance, her presidential aides get her installed in the Protocol Department of the US government. Even so, they spoil things at times, but they try hard and learn a lot. They even capture the romantic attention of an official at the State Department. But is there another evil conspiracy in the making, involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? One blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This film features a beautiful golady like the picture and a stupid "fox" as they say. Sunny is learning her way around the US government forest very well. She even has important things to say about honesty and non-existence in the vicinity of her protocol. Perhaps, Arab society will be less exciting than this work, but for those who love to laugh, rented this day.
