After living in Ontario all my life, in the same town where Marilyn Moore grew up, I heard stories from my parents, grandparents and family members. So when I found out they were going to shoot a movie about her, and that the beginning would be filmed on my street, and her house was very close to my house, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which revolves around Marilyn Moore, you get a completely different picture of her as a person, and she was considered to be strangely beautiful by people who had a real chance to know her except for her abusive family Very much the child, except for one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you are smart enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school, you will discover that she was really injured even before you set foot in an institution, and was always defensive and what seemed like a lack of desire to learn in a school environment was actually awkward From the fact that they were not able to. <br /> <br /> Marilyn did not deserve the life she got, with the help she desperately needed. The government and the people around her helped more in her death not to try to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still find myself angry that she was put in prison in defense of herself from a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said: "They did not know what to do with it until they closed it and killed it." I believe with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Relax in Marilyn's peace, you deserve it so much.
