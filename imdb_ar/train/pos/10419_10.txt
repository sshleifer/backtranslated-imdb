I have to agree with Mr. Caruso Junior was Lanza, the coolest voice god had to offer if he just had the courage to go to break out of Hollywood and go to opera. He could have been American Caruso telling everyone that he could have been but in any case is a wonderful introduction to art that does not form any bones Around them, and if so it will be. Watch the movie you'll see why Mr. Lanza is still in the discussion even at my house. Someone says Pavarotti tell Mario LANZA. For the same movie when the DVD has to be restored and the VHS is not good enough but this should also be the only Lanza movie put on the DVD the others are right on bad bad and boring.
