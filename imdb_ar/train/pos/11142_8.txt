Just kidding. <br /> <br /> Looking for greener pastures in New York City, John Voight is a young cowboy cowboy (like Forest Gump) Joe Buck of Texas. It does not take too long for Big Apple to swallow him without mercy and his ambitions, and soon Joe will be the target of the New Yorkers' cold and their thugs in the streets. Because of his pure heart, he feels sorry for one of these thugs, Ratsu Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), then moves with him later in the wreckage of his apartment and the two literally struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> While Midnight Comedy has been classified as a drama, it is best described as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy in my opinion. It is, above all, a beautiful and elegant film in the contemporary hip-hop gathering in the late 1960s with a stunning cinematic portrayal of Warhol concerts and adds it to New York City. Cowboy Joe Buck is jammed somewhere between them, confirming his out-of-place status. We feel difficult in his struggle, but also to get enough money to feed Rizo Ratsu. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes because they are also rich in content and expect a lot of hearts. I imagine that this film should inspire Forrest Gump with his leading and uncommon lead, and to some extent the Dundee Crocodile films where he deals with the same kind of humor - in contrast to the cowboys and the New York spot. Very attractive and creative film I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
