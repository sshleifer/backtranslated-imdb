In this set of horror films, forty paranoia during the Cold War, Reagan America, and high school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star of appearance in Full Moon in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania, while being lost on the streets one night, being bitten by a wolf. When he returns to the United States, he can not control his animal urges and continue the wave of murder. Disappointed, fleeing the city. After decades, Tony returns to the city and returns to high school. Is still unable to control its transformations, and the city's residents and friends realize that it is not entirely human. All these things peaked during the big football match in schools. <br /> <br /> I expected this to be one of the "very bad" films that appeared in the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the film was in fact, funny legit. The cast, including Kenneth March as a fickle manager, Rose Kelly as Tony's ex-flame, Donald Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an eccentric doctor, came out with fun results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was struck by the similarity of writing and humor with "Family Guy". "Full Moon High" has the same attitude, and does not take himself seriously.
