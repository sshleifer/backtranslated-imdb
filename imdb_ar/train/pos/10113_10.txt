I love this film I'm not a fan of Ed Wood Jr., I would rather appreciate his "unlimited enthusiasm" and admit his shortcomings. His films are fun, but his personal story is full of pain. I was hoping, and I was pleased to find, that this film would be about understanding his troubled life, rather than just stacking it with praise after his death. From start to finish, this film evolves from a documentary to legends, leaving actors and scenes unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get are people who know Ed Wood better to talk about in all respects, positive and negative, and show us their personality as much as Ed. We get an insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his romances, his drinking, his sexual life, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to the making of his films. <br /> <br /> The same film was filmed in a low-budget way that looks respectable to Ed, as if using the techniques of most of the theatrical films released in 1996 would be disrespectful (somewhat like wearing a great suit compared to the president) . The group designer uses the spirit of humor and also a great deal of foresight when matching each member of the team with their backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Fans will be eager to hear personal testimony about Ed Wood's differences, and newcomers will be surprised that this man was real. The DVD can not be found with jewels ("the crossroad of Lerado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is surprisingly interesting and interconnected. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood used to identify people by associating him (better or worse) with one woman in history as a "pool owner" for one time allowing him and his friends to baptize in her own swimming pool . This ability comes to determine the person's legacy through the universal, because the amazing effect of the film is not only give a good idea of ​​the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the society that he created. In one way or another, without more than one member being interviewed on screen simultaneously, Ed Wood's relationship between the different people in his life becomes clear, leaving the viewer with a great sense of participation. <br /> <br /> Even the title hints at the B-type horror type, but in the end, we see that even this is kindness. What begins as stories unrelated to random people ends with the conclusion that all actors will be forever transformed into a coherent and unpredictable fabric that history will bring to a painful unity with Wood's myth. <br /> <br /> In many ways paradox, Ed Wood Jr. can not condense into one view. This cooperative effort is closest to knowing that we can get it at all. Being a mixture of subjects, they are at the same time respectful, provocative, thoughtful, pleasant, pleasant, sad, pleasant and satisfying.
