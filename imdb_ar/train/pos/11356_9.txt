This is an excellent film. It is about a number of things: the search for a serial killer, the Russia-Soviet bureaucracy, the leadership of one man, and the relationship between this man (the chief investigator) and his boss. <br /> <br /> The thing that most hangs in with me is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (a bad spelling excuse, please!). For some reason, it moves to see their evolution of hostility and crime turn into respect and photography and work together. One line in the film sums up to me: "He was saying something brilliant, but he was overcome by emotion." <br /> <br /> Acting perfectly by all actors, even the smallest parts have been done with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a quick-moving thriller; in fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfactory and untapped for crimes at all. <br /> <br />
