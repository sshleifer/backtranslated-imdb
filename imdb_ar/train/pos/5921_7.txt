I was the production accountant in this film, and I had to do some vocal work, so I'm not totally biased, but if it was terrible, I would say so. I thought it was a fun movie, not a highly acclaimed masterpiece, in any way, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible states that laughter is useful as a medicine, so watching this movie can be beneficial to your health. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors in this picture have not reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one since then has continued much greater fame. Melanie Myron was seen on television on a weekly basis as a feature in a television series called "Thirty-Something." Robert Englund became known as Freddy Krueger, and still haunts people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this show is Dub Taylor, who played Sharif. He was an excellent comedy actor, a nice and honest person. We all enjoyed working at this show and I think this fun comes.
