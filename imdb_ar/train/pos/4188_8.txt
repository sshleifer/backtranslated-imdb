Samuel Fuller is an interesting film director, mainly because he had some inconsistent policies in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represent hypocrisy and madness in America and "The Big Red One" were an effective picture of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" described the war as a necessary hell and "Pickup on South Street" On the dangers of the communist spies, all his films are made very entertaining spectacles, and although he was often cloudy as a film director, Fuller was as good as any of the studio's top contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, , The style of filmmaking progresses significantly from its time - it is also a fast, narrow, fast and sometimes brutal film. Wonderful machines Richard Wiedmark makes a great hero, and Jan Peters is very sexy as a girl working with her communist spy boyfriend.However, Stealer is Thlema Ritter, in a very delightful performance as a police tool.The angles used by Fuller are superb, making the sequence more exciting and brutal The camera moves constantly like Tarantino and his school do after 40 years. "Pickup on South Street" is a very exciting film. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite film for Fuller, but this is the second time. (8/10)
