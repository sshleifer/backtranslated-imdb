Diane Keaton performed prominently in this sad and funny story that included a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "Family Stone", "05", who had one daughter and loved it can be described beyond the words. She always called her and told her "Dorothy Surrender", an expression used in the "Wizard of Oz", 1939. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie shares herself deeply with friends and lover of her daughter. As Natalie realized, whenever she found out more about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. A wonderful movie for viewing and enjoying, especially all the good works of all supporting actors.
