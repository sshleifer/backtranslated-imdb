I think this is probably the most extreme film I have ever seen. Robert Harling's scenario is close to perfect, just check out the "Quotation marks" section; in the second thought, just rented a DVD, because it renders renders that fonts really sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field has performed an outstanding performance as never before, and Kevin Klein is hilarious. Robert Downey Jr is a wonderful habit, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot like a besieged fashion designer. I have never been an Elizabeth Shui fan, but she is wonderful here as a real person surrounded by a cartoon of the "The Sun Sets Sets" - under which you feel like you love him in his grave. Either that, or he laughs hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
