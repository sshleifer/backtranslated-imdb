The first time I saw this film was in the 80s, but it has been revised now, this film is still alive. Some modern films focus on similar themes, but they do not match this French teacher. <br /> <br /> A head - obviously JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The resulting grand investigation found Lee Harvey Oswald's character guilty, but one jury member insisted on further inquiry. Reveals some amazing evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this movie does not play with emotions, but focuses on an intriguing portrayal of the plot and how it fits all, drawing a new image For assassination. So a real psychological experience is used for this interpretation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK this film is more rational, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of modern films, and I have kind of movies sometimes. I was sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is "must must". Unique and exquisite, the music by Inyo Morikon is wonderful. This film deserves a very good rating, if it is a Hollywood production, it will certainly be famous. <br /> <br />
