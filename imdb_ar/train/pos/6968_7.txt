Just as the new BSG was not what the original series fans expected, Caprica may not offer what most new BSG fans expect (mostly). It's a very interesting program, if not a bit concerned, or at least a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the great excitement of CGI for BSG (new), you will be very disappointed. If you like drama, you may find something you like and perhaps sympathize with. <br /> <br /> The story of the story looks at how Cylons develops, why Adama hates them and the origin of the Unification Society. The book can also address the "play of God (s) for man and create or re-create a" human "life.It will be interesting to see how this plays. <br /> <br /> I found him swinging in some parts and preaching in some The other parts, but it was generally promising: A small part of me wishes (or I hope) that there may be some small grains of BSG there (regardless of the background story I mentioned), but this is likely to cover the story too much. BSG, I'll have to wait to see if Caprica is growing up on me, but it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be really easy to discover this as a failure If I compared it to the previous series, but I was willing to give it a chance.In general, I thought it interesting to make me see how the actual string was before "throwing the towel."
