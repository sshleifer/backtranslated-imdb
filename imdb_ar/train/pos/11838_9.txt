This is one of the most cool, relaxing, beautifully animated films I have ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, you can make sounds and music feel like you are in the movie! This film is not only great for children but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting you, you can do whatever you see your mind, courage and boldness. This movie can make you cry sometimes too, and it is always a nice touch in the movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some films give you a vague feeling after seeing them, and "Spirit" is definitely one of them! I voted 9/10 stars for animation and music and a wonderful idea for a movie, gave me a lot of soul!
