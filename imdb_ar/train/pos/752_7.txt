Four teenage girls in a Los Angeles suburb face all kinds of problems: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, older friends. Judy Foster, a kind of chicken mother, tries to keep everyone together like a "family" (like the family unit she never owned). The sad thing about the film is that she can not. I hope, everyone grows up and disappears. This delicate plot point, although fully confirmed, is tampered with unfortunately. Do we really need a long sequence with Scott Bayo outperforming a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or a longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange view of "the pain of illusion". Some dialogue is actually a whole episode, and I did not care much about the late editing of the film, which disappears indirectly from death to a wedding. But these are the watchers of what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of narrow bond. Judy's face finally speaks volumes. If the audience suffocates in the end, this film has been achieved. Do not overwhelm the crying nor ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes to understand it. *** from ****
