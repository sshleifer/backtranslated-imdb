I am a big fan of the Faerie Tale theater and have seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic, and classic. I recommend this to all ages. It is great for young children because it's good, Cinderella, which is great for adults and teenagers because it's funny and not on top. I saw him when I was young and still watching him. She has great lines quoted by me and my family all the time. The representation is great and does not advance in age. If you like fairy tales and romances, you'll love this. I have watched many Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theater theater performances. They are all appeal to all ages and are all very unique and entertaining.
