This film, over the past ten years, has become one of my best counterfeit experiences. The three thematic threads presented by Kazan have a unique and separate pleasures. Local chats between Bel Geddes and Widmark, and mobility between rooms, small gestures such as the Barbara phone book put on the chair down her son so he can get to the table, those small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, are all well made and natural. More than anything else, I like their own balcony, those second living room where it is obvious they spend a lot of summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but particularly between Widmark and Douglas characters. It may not be entirely original and characterized by severe disorder but generally, it seems to be real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the bold tale of Blackie and his torn little gang, makes us the closest to a dark and frightening world. Plasys is a cool place like a block of ice. This self-proclaimed entrepreneur, this man who made himself clearly has the complexity we only use briefly. For me, this film remains a very satisfying experience.
