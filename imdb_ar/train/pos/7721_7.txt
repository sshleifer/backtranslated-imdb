A mobile bird (literally overseen) travels a crew of about 20 male astronauts to hundreds of millions of light years of land to verify a colony founded 25 years ago on a "forbidden planet." What they found was a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on Earth, a pretty young woman who was quite incompetent, and her father, a female physicist who haunted him more than the demons of ancient civilization he had submerged. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a puzzle killing the core of science fiction. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is an extension, in some ways, an insult to the science fiction genre. If it is stripped, making it a scientific film, of course, is The Tempest, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something similar? <br /> <br /> Underneath, this is a cautionary tale about the progress, technology and social development necessary to be used appropriately and safely. Still, the film continues with all hope for our future, which we expect from programs like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this movie is best described as beautiful. Special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backgrounds are strong enough to make guidance uninspiring and unequal unnoticeable. If this is not the case for retro-styled props in the 1950s, you might think you're seeing a piece of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of this very special kind of sci fi I like to call the 1950s sci-fi, however, in my opinion, the best thing to see for sure is for anyone interested in sci-fi and special effects. The smart plot, which is now vulgar by reusing it in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape, deserves attention and will retain the interest of most science fiction fans. The hikers will be particularly interested in the different aspects of the film, which seems to have inspired themes from the original Star Trek series that was broadcast about 12 years ago, although they may find themselves frustrated by the relatively moderate sex discrimination of the 1950s and the absence of any Racial integration. Although I do not mean the word "netbek", the lack of clear social progress in this film was the only major problem I encountered. <br /> <br /> It is likely that some will watch this film just to look at the beautiful-looking young Leslie Nielsen in one of his first roles in the tournament. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and sometimes poor people are poor (especially at the height of the film). Walter Bijon, though excellent in other films, is too much to represent his role. Frances, Eric Holiman and Robbie the Robot are the most prominent actors in this crowd, although the representatives of the characters who fill the group in general do a good job. I think the problems with performance are the fault of the manager and the editor, like anything else. Although they got most of the movie correctly.
