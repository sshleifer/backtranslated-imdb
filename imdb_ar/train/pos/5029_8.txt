I went to this movie, perhaps a bit dodgy by the penetration films rampant on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was a happy pace with a dark and sad atmosphere. What is most surprising is that the amount of blood that has already appeared was very limited. As with most good films, this film leaves something to be imagined, and Bill Paxton did a great job of directing. While watching the episode "Anatomy of a Scene" at the end of the video, it was good to see that some of the wonderful and wonderful things I noticed were deliberate and not just "oh, that looks good, and kept" Direction. This is a Moody movie, full of evil. Still, for the dark subject, much of it is filmed in broad daylight, even in some of the most disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (well, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and I never went to the top. Au contraire, is very undervalued and works very well for this kind of film. If there is one region lacking this film, it is in the end, which seems a little fickle, but it still works at a simpler level without destroying the mood or message film. What is the message? It is something everyone decides for himself. In general, on a scale of 1-10, this film records 8 degrees for those who love the Southern Gothic genre ("Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"), and about 5 for those who do not.
