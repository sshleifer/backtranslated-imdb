There is no point in passing the story since a sufficient number of reviewers have done so. Here are some different tips from one of the "religious nuts," as one fanatical critic puts it. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) is perhaps the classic example of how women deal with men through sex. There's a lot of truth about what Barbara Stanwyck describes in this film: look attractive, beat your lashes, give your body for free ... and men will fall to help you with anything you want. <br /> <br /> In this case, career progression was the ultimate goal of money ..... much of it. There are at least four men in this film who do exactly that, even if it spoils their lives in this process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many critics seem to hate - gives another wonderful message: all the money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel good. The sad comment is that many "critics" here prefer to have unethical messages, preferring chaos to substance. Not surprisingly, I think. <br /> <br /> In any way you look at it, the movie is fun from start to finish and Stanwick has some wonderful lines, especially at first when her raw father tells the gamut of customers. In less than 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
