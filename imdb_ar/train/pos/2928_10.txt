EDDI MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the most solemn concert in my life. Usually, most back-ups have periods of calm at some point, but not that person. For 90 minutes there is no moment is not funny side by side. From the moment Eddie makes a terrifying impression of Mr.T, he laughs nonstop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was done in 1983, Eddie did not do anything funny. It is unreasonable that the man who wrote this wonderful show wrote a film called HARLEM NIGHTS and it was not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're there, please go back and make an intravenous movie prom from Delicious. Believe me your fans will love you for it. I think you know that.
