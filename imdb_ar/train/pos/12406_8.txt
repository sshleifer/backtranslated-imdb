A prison that was no longer in existence for more than 20 years was reopened and Ethan Sharp (the late great actor Lin Lynn Smith), who was a guard there, was revived as an observer. While the prisoners are put in work to fix the place, they are asked to storm the old execution room. This unleashes a fierce spirit ruthlessly rousing guards and prisoners; the simple prisoner who can be a low prisoner, Burke (Figo Mortensen, who shows a real balance in an early role) is a role in the hero's role. <br /> <br /> I know it's not logical to praise Joe's film (filmed in a virtual prison near Rawlins, Wyoming), but he brings this horror film to a higher level. I've got a great sense of euphoria, created initially. Director Rene Harlin made his fourth turn at directing. I got "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" in the lead of the concert and started an impressive track in action movies, thriller and horror movies. <br /> <br /> She may have stock characters, but she has an influential crew bringing them to life: Chelsea Field in the role of a young woman who vies for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a veteran coach condemning Chris, and Tom Everett in a restless role in Rabit, Evan Keane as the outgoing Lazania, Tommy "Tiny" Leicester as the soft giant Tiny, and Arlene Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It should also be noted that Kane Hodder, as the acting acting president, helped him to fall into the minds of Jason Vorhis in the Friday Friday series. <br /> <br /> Beautiful special effects, fine lighting, thanks to Mac Ahlberg, the terrible music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, wonderful visual images, an incredibly depressing location, and a comprehensive and delightful presentation make it very entertaining. It's bad, wonderful and fun for horror lovers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
