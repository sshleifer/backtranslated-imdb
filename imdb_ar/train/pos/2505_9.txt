Many people judge him as a fan service because many super stars star in this film (Gackt and Hyde and Wang Lee Hom is a famous singer in Japan). But do not judge him before you see him, what I say. Gackt and the staff were very serious when they made this film and worked hard. It's a good movie with a sensitive story inside. Several scenes can be very enjoyable and others are very sad. They made it so good that I can not stop watching this again. <br /> <br /> I wrote the story well, but I admit that their actions are a bit disappointing. This is special for Hyde because his skill in acting is less than the other and it is strange to hear the way when speaking in another language except his native language (Japan). But this is comprehensive because this is the first time they act in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Gakt is trying to show us how a person can be very weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, when Xu asked Ki to turn Yi Chi into a vampire like him because he would not let her die, when Shaw died, Matt Kee Shot Sun, the best and most beautiful scene is when Xu leaves until I say that Hyde's skill is still strange, Two skin in this scene !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes as fast as if she did not tell why Son joined the local mafia and that she is Sho's enemy because they are good friends in the past and the son is Sho's brother. <br /> <br /> No matter what, I like this movie ~ (too many ^^). <br /> <br /> This is a motion picture with a touching story.
