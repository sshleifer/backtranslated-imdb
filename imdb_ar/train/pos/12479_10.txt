What is the probability of the arrival of the helium balloon "Mermaid" from the city of Yuba, California (November 8, 1993) and landed after 4 days, (November 12) in Mermaid, Prince Edward Island, Canada. (About 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film not only helps children overcome the losses, but the elderly also. I hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Ronda
