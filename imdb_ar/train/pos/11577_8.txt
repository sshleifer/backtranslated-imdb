This was a really wonderful movie. It goes without saying that you do not need silly things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. They pass the continents in seconds, people fire and nothing happens, swords are burned, samurai fight on drowning gasses, David Essex is an example of the villain's villain, and John Reese Davis is just the dude. I enjoyed this movie, but I liked movies, and this is the perfect example of a very fishy film. If you like Battlefield Earth, you'll catch up with this movie, its fast, fast, silly, and samaristastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> As if it was made in 1972
