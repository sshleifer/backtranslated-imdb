Do not forget, a clever and thrilling film by one of the real French film geniuses, Henry Fernwell, the master plot is exactly parallel to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, speaking in an indescribable fictional country. The film, visually as well as plot, is a sharp razor. He was shot with extreme precision, following Henry Faulnay, the prosecutor who took it upon himself to reveal the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, not least because of the cold and analytical precision of its comment on the so-called internal workings of the modern state. The atmosphere and characters are all quite believable, and Verneuil did nothing to chance in his narrow layout. On another level, this relatively unknown 15-year-old film has appeared on Oliver Stone, who earned fame for JFK, a lousy film in many areas, the least believable ... It is a masterpiece , Any movie lover should see, preferably in his original French version with submarines.
