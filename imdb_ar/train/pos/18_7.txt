"Stanley and Iris" is a warm film about two people who find each other and help each other overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he did not learn to read and write. The iris is a widow and has two teenage boys working in a bakery where he meets Stanley. She decided to teach Stanley how to read in her home in her spare time. Over time they become emotionally involved. After Stanley learns reading, he goes to a good job in Chicago, just to return to Iris and asks her to marry him. <br /> <br /> It's a really good movie without nudity, violence or blasphemy, which is rare in today's movies. Good movie in all respects. <br /> <br />
