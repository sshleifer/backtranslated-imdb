The exotic cat and mouse are so frequent Jerry jumps in a bottle of invisible ink. He gets a bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without his knowledge. The cat becomes wise and tries to do things to make him "see" Jerry even if it is not impossible. Of course Jerry gets Butch also known as Killer and also known as Spike the dog in action (even if it is late in the end, and its contribution is very small). Most of the gags are working and all are as violent as any good tom and short jerry should really be. These fun cartoons can be found on one CD from the Spotlight DVD collection for "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My estimate: B +
