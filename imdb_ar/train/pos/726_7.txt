Vince Lombardi High School has a new director - the evil Mrs. Tugar (Marie and Ronov). It intends to ban rock and roll together. She tracks the head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves Ramones. Nor does the head of the football team at the school (Vincent van Patten) seem to be communicating with any girl - unaware that Kate Rambo (Dae Young) is his favorite. <br /> <br /> Midnight Movie Moment. This version was released in general and was almost immediately bombed - but as a film in the middle of the night, it was a great success and continued to play throughout the eighties. I remember attending more than a few of them when I was in college - it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing loudly at each joke and generally enjoying the fun. <br /> <br /> Watching her as an adult now I can not imagine why I loved this so much. The script is young and full of farmers I could not believe I was hearing. Characters change randomly and the movie goes to jump everywhere. What saves this is some really funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who really enjoys the same). Everyone is full of energy and playing their WAY roles on top (as they should). As for Rammons ... I was never a fan. I do not like the melody of the title but the rest of the songs did not really occur to me. If you love Ramones, you may give this a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for kids (he has PG rating) who may find her silly but fun. I especially think they will love the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for a fucking midnight movie from the 1980s you may want this. Otherwise stay away. Give it 7.
