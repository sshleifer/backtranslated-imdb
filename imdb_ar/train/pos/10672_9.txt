Anyone who saw this movie and reviewed it badly, I would like to refer them to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and has given it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. It may not be perfect or amazing, but I enjoyed it. Chorus Line is not just a story; it is a collection of stories about the lives of those hoping for Broadway. I read reviews where people said that a lot of time was wasted on romance between Zack and Cassie. This is an incorrect view. It is another story along with all the other stories that are listed about each of Broadway's ambitions. What people fail to realize is that those who dance in Broadway shows go through the same things as the average man. I think this is the goal of the whole show. It is not only a display of the talent of these special dancers, but to give us some influential things to think about life in general. This is the study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who dreams of becoming a star on Broadway watches this film with a great sense of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes it is a bit confused by the speed of specifying lines of a particular story, but overall, I enjoyed it completely. Take a closer look at the film, then maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about.
