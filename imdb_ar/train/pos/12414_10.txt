The first American film by Renny Harlin was one of the best horror films to be set in prison (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Now, he is the newly reopened prison guard, and the ghost of the man returned to bloody revenge. This film, which is characterized by atmosphere and mood, is very bad, characterized by many revolutions and ugly violence. On the one hand amusing massacre.
