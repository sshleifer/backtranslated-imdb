After I had not seen the movies before (and the inability to stand with Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go to see the Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see them for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon could be fun. <br /> <br /> Fast fighting scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions were what drove you out of your TBU seat. Keep the CIA and Bourne fantasies close to your toes and enjoy your time. <br /> <br /> However, there are many things that are spread with cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence got frequent and boring in the end. Although Damon kept us entertained and always seemed one step ahead of the CIA, I was a little annoyed by Bourne's persistence. A car crashed and went out as if it were being exploited or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Second (inevitably) - a meager camera. It was very fragile and was quite remarkable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my classroom (even teachers) dizzying the sea. Tell us by teachers that if we use it in a movie we made in the chapter, it will be a mistake automatically and we will be asked to use a tripod. It is fair enough if Greengrass wanted to look as if we were watching Damon and Stiles being a conversation, but surely we would not shake our heads violently! <br /> <br /> But all in all the TBU is a fun movie worth watching. But I did not think it was the best film of the year, despite being an amusing piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
