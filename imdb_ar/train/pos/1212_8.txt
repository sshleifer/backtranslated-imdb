Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation Not a bad movie at all. In fact, I love it so much. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is tacky and the story is a little rumored at times. But Darkheart, while the darkness is very intense, is a very convincing and evil form, and Hadley Kay did a great job of expressing it. When talking about voice acting, it was fantastic, quite a bit at all. The animation is rich in color, and some of the images were initially especially impressive. The songs and the result is beautiful, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter was always my favorite of the two. Bears care, I love, adorable, very well children. The end is the real tearjerker. All in all, a fun KDE harmless. Bethany Cox
