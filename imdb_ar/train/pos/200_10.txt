Updated from previous comment. Marion Davis's great and demeaning comedy shows in this late silent comedy (1928), which also features the wonderful William Haines. Davis plays on his arm from Georgia, which crashed with Hollywood with the help of Haines, a small player in raw comedy films. They appear together in cheap comedy films until Marion is "discovered" and become a dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A gorgeous lamp in Hollywood and its excuses. Davies & Haines is a great team, featuring guests such as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Lola Parsons and Ren√© Adori Eileen Pringle and Marion Davis (you should see her) are yelling. Any serious movie buff or anyone interested in Marion Davis must still suffer from bad luck! Del Henderson plays the role of father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Raleigh is a strong leading man. <br /> <br /> It was said that the SHOW PEOPLE program used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think May Murray is closer). Davis and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film is parallel to the rise of Swanson from the single-track comedy Mack Sennett with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille from the late teens and early twenties. <br /> <br /> Davis and Heinz of MGM were huge stars and friends. It is strange that MGM has never cooperated with them. They're gorgeous together! A sweet and passionate love story from Hollywood early. Greta Garbo and Bob Daniels are mentioned but not shown.
