This is one of the coolest stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie is directed by Larry Clark, it is likely that this story will show about shooting in school through the eyes of the killer and anything that led the person to feel crazy in the first place. Instead, the plot focuses primarily on the results of school shooting, and how it affected the victims who survived. <br /> <br /> You've seen Phillips busy in other movies before, but her performance in this movie is by far, her best. The only other movie I saw with Erika Christensen was "Swim Fan" which made me want to see almost this film, but it performed very well on its own. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movie films I've seen that could actually make me cry. Trust me when I tell you that this does not happen very much. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, that's all ...
