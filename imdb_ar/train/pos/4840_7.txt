I watched the last DVD of this movie in the horror section of an Oxford Street store and also announced it was a "classic movie". In fact, it's a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> His cheerful, lively and delightful humor may come mainly as a cultural shock to many who have been used to the sad and serene flavor of much of British comedy in the last 25 years. Yet there are still those who appreciate his energetic and cheerful character and the complete avoidance of the blades. Askey was the idol of the great Tommy Cooper who often borrowed the "self-choking" gag that Arthur tried to entertain with stranded travelers. <br /> <br /> There is a stunning and rare appearance by the least rated Linden. Travers, who makes his effect as mysterious Julie.
