I thought it was a very funny film. I love dog movies and comedies combined where they were twice good. K-9, K-911 and K-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Peloschi hysterical and Jerry Lee are hilarious and wonderful because they make up a fantastic team. The only downside is that I did not really understand how Dolly's wife died. I died before this film but how? If they say so I should have missed. Other than that I give two thumbs / tails up! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have received a lot of training. They were very funny and all the sounds that Jerry had me issuing when he was talking to him were very funny. My favorite was when Jerry sang to me and when he was biting people's lawyers for very funny information
