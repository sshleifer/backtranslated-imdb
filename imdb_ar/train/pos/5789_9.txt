This is one of my favorite things with Mariette Hartley, Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead-and-the --- space - a ring of episodes. <br /> <br /> It is an important step, from the middle of 1961, in the long Cold War in which the United States was later involved. The spectacle of the defeated city, the sparse dialogue of the near-hungry characters, the flimsy uniforms, the minimal work "says" everything: the absurdity of the continuation of the conflict that threatens to destroy human life and modern civilization, and all that is sweet and recoverable. <br /> <br /> It is a "myth" because it was made at a time when events were different, such as the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962), it could have been a reasonable representation of one The largest cities in the United States, where it was destroyed and overwhelmed by a few miserable survivors. I see it as a "fairy tale" because it is not only a cautionary tale, but because it is the most concise recapitulation of all our folk legends: it is a love story, in an impossible situation, and includes two very incompatible lovers.
