Val Kilmer and Diane McDermott are fantastic. I saw Kilmer at the door, but his interpretation of John Holmes was wonderful. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was slow. Wonderland is a film capable of presenting the story of a horrific crime from the perspective of a man steeped in drug addiction and indifferent to what ever happens. At the same time, the figure of John Holmes is a very smart man who is able to pass through the most horrific and ugliest situations without being hurt. The movie is worth seeing more than once. Seventies sensual ambience and full of amazing drugs.
