1985 was a good year for movies - it was probably fantastic - but this year that missed Gong went a long way to convince fans that Ol 'Oscar was nothing more than a cover for good party members. The person who had to wait for another 8 years before any prejudices prevented them from handing over the statue before allowing them to give him 7 to Schindler's list, which can be said, is not good (I'm half Polish). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Schindler was classy. I did not go out of Africa (which won that year) too; but in my opinion it was a category behind this category: an epic story of suffering and hope that made me cry - and I'm not a big fan. Maybe it was music (great), or cinema (sumptuous), but probably just acting: and Bie, who proved to us all that she was much more than a comedian; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before ; And of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but, at that time: who knew?
