Is the most prominent feature of 1917. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan leader after the death of her father. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers live in a simple life of "folk hunters". My copy is very dark and difficult to read at times, but the film has spectacular ocean views, and the camera works on great boats. Maurice Tournor Beckford took out this beautiful film. Beckford was already a major star in 1917, and it seems that this film has only been written for her: a happy young woman succeeds in a misfortune. Beckford whip lazy villagers towards the church is very funny. The final sights on the sunken ship were very well done. The film is not great, but still worth watching. Matt Moore (Beckford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is a love interest, a good boy like a huge island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I could not see her either. My copy intersects with a lot of bells and cues and adds a strange sensation when the warning bells in the village tread. very Influential.
