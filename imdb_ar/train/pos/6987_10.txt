Put the "thing" UFO aside. This was the best documentary I've ever seen. The actual reporting by Neil and Buzz ... should be seen. Interviews and reports are a revelation because most of the information was secretly stamped in 1969 and released only in 2006. There is no documentary film containing details or accuracy for such a short duration of 47 minutes ... FACTS will blow you up and you will leave In awe of the dangers taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you seen a man save his life? Bet no. Neil saves his life when he separates him from death only milliseconds. Amazing to watch. It is a farce that people did not know all the details associated with the landing on the moon and the courage that these men were facing when facing a particular death, from a failed computer ... 10 Stars!
