This is a truly wonderful piece of film achievement. From the beginning, I was addicted to the story (real) when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stefan Ria) weeps during the autopsy on the remains of the children. This is the amazing story of Andrea Chicatello, who was played wonderfully by Jeffrey Dimon (Green Mile). In fact, he plays it well and sympathizes until the viewer begins to pity him, so remember what he is. The psychiatrist Alexander Buchanovski, who was superbly played by Max von Siddo, was a connoisseur of every detail, and the point he raised when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union became quite clear because of the behavior of the local Communist Commissar of Bundarchuk, played by Jos Akland. For me though, it was the outstanding performance of Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a truly wonderful personality actor is. I was in tears when he told how the FBI had followed closely and admired his work. This film, "Silence of the Lambs" in the shadow, from the Soviet scene in the gloomy atmosphere, places great performances on all participants. <br /> <br /> This movie was rated 10/10
