I thought this was a very charming film that focused on the lives of Mary Kate, Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! Both try to make both himself and his parents happy; unfortunately, it is not easy for them to do so! I thought this movie was wonderful and charming, and if you're a fan of these wonderful young ladies, I'm sure you'll agree here! If you have not seen this movie yet, I say you have not really missed it. Great time, and you should definitely spend time to see it now! This movie is the real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
