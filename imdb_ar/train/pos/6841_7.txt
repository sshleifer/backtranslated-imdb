This is probably one of Brian De Palma's most famous films, but not one of his best. Body Double and The Fury and Carrie are better films, but this is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma Hitchcock was severely affected, and this film is taking off on Psycho. Angie Dickinson, a bored housewife, thinks of an affair. After a psychologist, Michael Kane, accidentally drops a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After this point, it is better not to know what is happening, but there is a murder, and Nancy Allen is a call girl know the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective in the case that she does not trust Ellen, she must find the killer herself. It is a very good film but it is not one of the best films of Palma.
