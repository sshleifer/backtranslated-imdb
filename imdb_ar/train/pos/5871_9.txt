I cherish every frame of this beautiful film. It's about ordinary people, the people we all know, who suffer a little in their lives and have some luggage to carry. Just like all of us. Robert Dineiro, Ed Harris and Cathy Baker are broadcasting life in their pictures and they are all excellent, but Harris is particularly tragic and therefore very real. He would really split up a truck driver who drinks so he does not feel anything. Becker enjoys as his sister interested in sensitive moments too - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, she does not seem to get flowers before, and probably not. Very worthwhile.
