A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys arrive to sweep the chimneys in the house of Professor Nodel, a mad scientist who has perfected the renovation serum. Stan & his work continues to bleak, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. After that the professor wants to experience his new experience ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit suprise, but a lot of wonderful absconding. It is particularly good for the testament contest in Stan & Ollie on opposite sides of the chimney. This is Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
