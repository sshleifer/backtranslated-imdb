I was very impressed when I saw the film. How Johnny managed to keep this hope and faith was amazing. Many people care only about what they want, and they care about all the things they do not have. They are small things, like chothes, and new car money. I have seen people cry because of a defect. This movie brings everything back to basics. Love, hope that the beauty of simple things but very important in life. It makes our daily problems seen on what is small and really unimportant. You see this boy and realize that he has been blessed with food and a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. Stop saying and smell roses have a really new meaning. I know that Johnny will see this and I would like to thank him very much for his participation in such faith, strength and humor with me.
