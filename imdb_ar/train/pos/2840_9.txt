I just saw a press release of this film and was pleasantly surprised. It is not usual to see all of my favorite actor's representatives in one film at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the Jeep Selection scene and it was good to see Rachel Bilson and Hayden together. I think their chemists on the camera are a direct result of their time together outside the camera. My favorite scene was by far (amazingly) a piece of Bret Ratner ... without giving much, I will just say that there is a surprise that will make you dangle ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were already good together and you got Already the impression that they spent a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawk segments have filled up surprises that look realistic and resemble the experiences I've experienced in the Big Apple. The film is a great place for its history, especially if you are fond of the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait until the next day in the cities of love.
