What can I say, I grew up watching Hom Sain Sein Hain, Home Abc Hayne Kun and Maine Pierre Kia. Suraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times, creating a mirage that is hard to find. Love and common family that love and wonderful. Vivah is a journey for a couple who get a marriage arrangement that turns the order of marriage and love. Shahid did a good job. Anupamji is always fantastic. Amrita Rao left it different though I felt that the other did not suit me in this role. We saw it in Ishk Vishk, Ab ke baras and Main ho on Na. So, he resigned from the different role in which he did not participate. They have been excellent at Main ho on Na and ishk vishk, but you may have put a bigger role in it. Anyway great go work through Barjatya. This film renews the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a new version but it's a wonderful story anyway. Suraj's films were wonderful all the way so we always expect something different from him. Great work by all Cast Crew and everyone. A beautiful family movie to enjoy with your parents, brothers, friends and loved ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
