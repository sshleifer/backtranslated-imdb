This is the best version of the classic Dicken movie. I've seen it over and over on VHS, and recently purchased a DVD version, which was formatted for TV (not widescreen). What I find interesting about this close-up is the English cast of actors who are now known as many of them have appeared in other North American films / performances since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "The Equator," as "the current Christmas ghost" . .
