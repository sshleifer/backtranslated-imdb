I am somewhat surprised that he has not commented any references yet on the basic chess error in the white-linen game against an undisclosed opponent just before the final. Although Jonathan Spielman has been used as a chess consultant, Lozen appears to be winning the game illegally. In the interval between the quick cuts and the return to the painting, it is not hard to discover that after the Luzhin group culminated in the Queen's sacrifice, his donkey on the d1 still hung by a black stunt on C1 against his corner in the corner at h1. Thus, he is unable to play the alleged mating movement Rd1-d8 which will be illegal - but he appears to be doing so for the reckless applause from the audience.
