This production is not controlled by a two-hour version issued on VHS in the United States, which is volatile and incomprehensible. It was a pleasure to watch the full version of the 6 hours available on DVD from the UK and it was compact. The deliberate pace and growing sense of threat is amazing, as is the visual and audio scene; this is an ancient Rome we have never seen before, and more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Franco Rossi just celebrated the series of his 1968 mini-series of Odyssey, and this mini-series is equally powerful. Bekim Fehmiu has become the best Ulysses for the screen, so Klaus Maria Brandauer may be Nero's best screen player. Now, one day I hope to see a Russian version of The Aeneid (Eneide) that was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. <br /> <br /> I have not yet decided which version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this version or polish is a mini series of 2001; each has different virtues and complement each other in many ways. Certainly, either be one of the Hollywood riot towers starring Peter Ostinov.
