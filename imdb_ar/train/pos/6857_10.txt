Dressed To Kill is one of the best thriller films ever made. Her dealings with sex and violence make this film an adult. Brian de Palma once again proves why no other director could match his use of the camera to a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, tells a lot of his story, accurately through the use of his image, and the wonderful result Pino Donaggio. The film was filmed in Panavision, and must be displayed on the widescreen, where De Palma uses the film's full screenplay to tell his story. The film that was cut on the video, "Dressed To Kill", is barely the same movie. The powerful performances through its amazing style, great direction, and perhaps the best movie ever recorded make "Dressed To Kill" a must.
