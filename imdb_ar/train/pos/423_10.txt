I just read the plot summary and it's the worst I've ever read. This wonderful film is not fair. For a good summary, read the Turner Classic Movies menu. Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a little kid. My sister and I could not wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies at this time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can see. The romance is clean and lovable. Interesting story line and wonderful songs. They do not make such films anymore. Good behavior and not on top. Bon and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other actors.
