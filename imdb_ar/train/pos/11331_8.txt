I do not usually have to write a review of a film, but the only comment of this film so far is fairly unfair, so I feel it is necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as his title in the theater I saw, "Fallen") follows Matisse, who is saved to Latvia alone, trying to learn about a woman who did not try to stop jumping from a bridge, as well as her reasons for doing so . This is the plot in short, but this film does not care about the story as much as the filming of the sin of a man who failed to act. As the investigator investigating the incident tells him, we usually do not care about the unknown faces we pass every day until they die. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Michaelangelo Antonioni and "Blowup" will most likely be many in any review I read about "Crisana". The influence of Anthony's philosophical and austerity style and the story of "Blowup" are clear. In fact, the writer / director Fred Kilman refers to that film in the scenes in which Matisse tries to identify the woman who jumped from the bridge, or at least thinks he did. <br /> <br /> The other person who shares his views on the film detracts from the appearance and sound of the "university class". He or she neglects to look at the budgetary constraints that a Latvian film is likely to face, but black-and-white cinematography in the atmosphere and surround sound succeeds artistically in portraying the Matiss unit. The sound of the wind and the noise of the streets in the background lend a sinister halo to a Fellini film, whether Kleiman's intention or not. There is no doubt that filmmakers had little money, but this limitation is used for the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" was successful as a study of the character with some humor thrown to prevent it from being too serious. He could have easily fallen into the motifs of the mystery story, but he avoids it and becomes an intelligent film of loneliness and guilt. If you're more interested in the plot, you may be frustrated by this movie and its ending. Otherwise, take the time to get involved. It is well worth a look.
