<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made the strange metaphysical rage popular, but this Canadian jewel makes her funny. <br /> <br /> Like most alien films, the plot was a little better, but let's prepare the scene. Friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can not deal with the world, and that means they do not have to. But this is where more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, made me smile for a long time after the final credits, and this is a rare experience with lots of pieces produced in large quantities of "none" there. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
