If you want to see something specific to "him" and "her", it means that this is the movie to be chosen. I sucked on the rom coms but my husband is not always very keen (what a man !!!). Anyway, I managed to convince him to watch him because I told him it was sport, you know what, I love her !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and her leading man (sorry but can remember his name) is of equal quality. When I saw the movie it was called "the perfect match" but I think the title has been changed in the UK because it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a movie about football with the title (same movie but the UK version - phew!), /> <br /> Anyway, all the reviews here will tell you in more detail if you need to buy the girls, take them from me, and get your husband / boyfriend in front of the TV on a Saturday night and you will laugh and cry together. A real jewel.
