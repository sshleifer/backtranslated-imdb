After reading several comments, I felt I had to add them in my year as well. "The Lost Sorrow" is one of the most short shorts that I think I have not seen. I've got a chance to see it at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this film was very beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short time. The story focuses on a girl victim of her abusive father. She was soon given the option of "stopping" by a demon played by Eric Ebari of Witchblade. After watching the show, I was amazingly impressed by how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he was capable of acting well! His character was very complex and very convincing. He was very impressive acting by him. The girl was fine and the father was fit. There is also death in this girl who follows her around so she can escape her future. The effects of cinematography were completely mind-blowing. I wonder if they have at least a hundred thousand budget for this purpose. It is rare to see high quality shorts. The opening was very breathtaking compared to any major feature film. This does not mean that it is not without its flaws - I thought it took a bit to get to the foreground and the introduction was very long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few short pants with this level of quality.
