Hak hap (black mask) is what I would call Ballet with fists and bangs. Surely the plot has been tested and heard before, a soldier who is biologically engineered and is part of a combat force of superheroes who decide that he feels that murder and brutal force are not the ways to settle everything and become peaceful, but when he knows that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote from That would keep them alive by confronting the police - his best friend is a cop - he becomes a black mask.) The style of the film goes, very visual, and works at least for me is amusing. I love martial arts movies that are scenic. People who fly in the air are lighter than the air and recover the second part after the shock. But that's what this film is about anyway, and it's a show for Jet Lee doing what he does best, and this is a stunning display of his skills, the least known. As with most fast-paced martial arts Ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung are now here in the United States for the first time, and these films are low in the plot and embrace a lot of stunning physical works. But I have to say, even with big holes in the plot (like how to see him safe in his apartment when there is only one scene before he has 20 men no more than 15 feet and a sign to escape? .... oh good comment from believe I think), the film remains interesting to me. Only until the last 20 minutes does the film seem like it might be a bit shorter. But still everything around the high-paced motion film.
