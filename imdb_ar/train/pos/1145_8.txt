This is a romantic comedy with a focus on comedy to change. As usual lovers - Sally Field as Queen of Soap Opera almost on the hill, Celeste Talbert. And Kevin Klein as marginalized and marginally gifted actors, Jeffrey Anderson - working in cross purposes, apparently unaware that they are madly in love, and so on. Sally Field follows a lot about comedic traditions, and she excels on her way to love and happiness. Kevin Klein, one of the most prominent men in recent years, is very good and very beat as he is able to be handsome, weak, seductive, and loved at the same time. <br /> <br /> The center of adventures about Celeste's fear of losing her audience as she entered her forties, reaches the point of crisis with the arrival of her niece, ambitious actress Corrie Craven (Elizabeth Shwe) who turns out to be her niece, with complications of conspiracy Which followed. Corrie managed to get a small part in the soap opera as a mute to the homeless homeless before discovering her real relationship with Celeste (and Jeffrey Anderson too) - but she did not mind. <br /> <br /> As a romantic point of view or frustrating results lead Robert Downey Jr. (Soap Opera Director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and nurse Nan). David Barnes is too hot for her, but she only cares about one thing: getting rid of Celeste until she shines in the group. To this end, Barnes is forced to do all sorts of things to destroy Celeste's march, but by coincidence and / or perverted logic, all his attempts explode, largely to the joy of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays the role of Rose Schwartz, the exhibition's author and close-knit Celeste, while Carrie Fisher plays a modest role as the hard-to-play producer. <br /> <br /> I thought this was more entertaining than just another parody of the soap opera world I saw (young doctors in love 1982 who shook the general hospital for TV and was very good). Soapdish is more fun with a lot of great fonts and great cool shows from Field, Kline and Downy Jr. But look at Sally Field.
