All films produced before 1912 really need to be seen with a sense of time and space. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the Lumière family [Father: Antoine (1840-1911), and his sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and operated a photographic and paper manufacturing plant. It was not a small enterprise; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pensions and social security - innovative for this time. It was located in Montpellier on the outskirts of Lyon, France. What made Louis Lumiere interested in building a film, in 1894, is still open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison's Kinetoscope (Peg projector), in Paris during the fall of 1894, introduced the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dixon, a Edison employee, invented a photographic camera on the size of the upright piano that was patented in February 1893. It was powered by energy from heavy storage batteries, and this huge tape injected a movie tape (newly developed by Eastman) The lens at about 40 frames per second (fps) was guaranteed, almost as an object, in "Black Maria" (basically the first film studio). Kinetescope machines offered approximate performances (less than one minute) <br /> <br /> During 1894, Luis Lumiere applied himself to the task of creating an animated camera He decided that, at 16 frames per second, the celluloid film and the continued vision of the human eye / brain would allow for normal movement. His camera, dubbed the Cinema, was the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine. Shooting for approximately 1 minute when it is rotated with a 16 fps lens. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (can be converted to a printer or projector by adding a light source printer) will make it portable enough to be moved To any place to record an event (provided that there is sufficient light available from AS Of the sun.) In the spring of 1895, Lewis filmed: Some cavalry men filmed the trick; a burning house with firefighters arriving and immerse the building underwater; and a number of other sights in Lyon and around. Using the Molteni lamp, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to the scientists gathered in the reception room at the Revue Generales des Science. The images are displayed on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen ran in an entrance between two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers that same year, Lewis filmed the next delegates and on the same night showed them animated pictures of their arrival. <br /> <br /> With appreciation from both scientific and photography communities, Lewis decided on a general exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films takes 1 minute, he will need at least 10 movies to make a good presentation. In one of these films, he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory and filmed the exit of staff at the time of quitting smoking. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine - who presented himself as the "fairground park" of the cinema - was the Indien of Grand Cafe on Capucines in Paris It was a winter Saturday night on December 28, 1895 "With the first audience sitting, an absolute view was displayed on the exterior of the Lumière factory (with closed gates), and some were happy because they were only seeing a normal routine. The film began with the movement, and Lewis had an instinctive sense of animation: this film has a beginning, a middle and an end. Many people try to ignore the camera and the photographer, who seem happy to leave a day behind, and the factory gates are closed. <br /> <br /> This was the first film to be made. Offering to entertain the general public.
