I watched this movie for the second time to try to figure out why it did not succeed (commercially or technically) as it should have been, and discovered a great technical advantage - which may eventually be a trade-off. <br /> <br /> First of all, this science fiction film is trying "hard", social commentary, more than the adventure of motion. There is an act in it, but that is not what it is about. If you focus on it, you will end up (as others have noted) to clone the bad "foreigners". But, again, this is not what is going on around him. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the transformation of Todd (Kurt Russell) from a human being to almost the machine and back to man (mostly back). But since he is not trying to give you a Hollywood-style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transition without talking, without much broad expressions. It does a really great job - it may take two shows to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The "social logic" surrounding it is flawed and it is not at all explained whether Todt's ability to keep his weapon against an army is supposed to be superior troops coming from his experience on the battlefield or from his newly discovered humanity or what, Still offers a wonderful show of Russell talents (easy to underestimate).
