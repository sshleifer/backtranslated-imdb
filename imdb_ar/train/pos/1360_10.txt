This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Parker Posey's character is very entertaining, and the librarian's idea will not be lost on anyone who has worked in the world of books and piles. <br /> <br /> If you are a student at the library, rent this. Then buy the sticker and hang it on your wall. The sound is highly recommended. This film has been shown to a number of library friends more than anyone else - they all fall in love with it.
