This one is there. Not much to say about it but it deals with a subject rarely addressed in festival films. I can see why this film has been banned for a long time, and the subjects that are addressed in the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say that the sexual excitement in the film deserves it and fits the mood of the film. It is a good film that works well and serves a purpose ... to shock the viewer and to transcend boundaries that we do not often see in films. I came across this movie on the internet and I think I might check it out. I enjoyed the movie because it is thought to be both exciting and somewhat exciting. Something you rarely see in movies today.
