<br /> <br /> An elderly man works as a concierge in a mental hospital to be close to his sick wife there and try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most silent and extraordinary masterpieces in the history of Japanese cinema. It has been lost for a long time, a print edition was found in the 1970s and a music track was added to fit the pictures perfectly. It may be influenced by the Cabinet doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed that he did not see the German film). However, it excels in style and in its most convincing (and cooled) portrayal of the internal mental state of prisoners in asylum. To achieve this, the film benefits from each of the individual films available at the time: multiple exposures and away from personal focus, slanted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressive lighting, and combinations among others. It's a very complicated film to follow, because it did not get titles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a montage of rain shots that hit hospital windows, windy trees and thunder. The annoying weather is difficult for patients and someone introduces them as a former dancer. The mix of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as a music that incites the dancer to engage in frenetic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenetic dance, being monitored by other prisoners. The multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients' view and their confused world view. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this amazing film that tries to represent the patient's consciousness and their "sane" world view. <br /> <br /> In three words you should see.
