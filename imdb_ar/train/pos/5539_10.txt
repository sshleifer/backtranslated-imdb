When I first saw this movie, it was a registered version and the title was Caged Terror. I still own the tape and admitted, I've seen it more than once from start to finish! The film has a very low budget and the dialogue is often amused unintentionally! I've got a few of my friends to watch this and we have received some laughter from the awful text. The movie is about a couple, (remember that's like the early seventies, so they're just a hip man!) They go on a weekend camping trip and I think it's supposed to be in New York State. They have some funny dialogue after catching and eating fish and the girl complains of the fish's death and they ate it! The man comes back with something ridiculous about how they eat fish and now he is part of them, and he goes; "This is a beautiful man!" A heavy man, really heavy! Haha! Anyway, along, come two veterinarians in Vietnam, someone plays flute, I think. (Anyway, they're fellow musicians!) It's clear that men are drawn to the girl and when the couple proves that they are not friendly, they end up intimidating them at night. The man ends up locked in a chicken coop and has to watch his girlfriend, who is gripping the two men. In fact, at the end of the night, it looks beautiful, and when the morning comes, the men, the girl and the man leave are free to leave. The man is supposed to have learned a lesson about how people treat, and that the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! Never fail to arm me anyway! If you can find this on a DVD and replace its old bar code, I'll buy it again, it's a classic camp! You should love this stuff!
