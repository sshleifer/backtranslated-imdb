I first saw this film when I was about 6 or 7 years old and did not really think it was particularly special. Over time, I watched it several times and began to grow on myself when I began to understand the ethics of the film, which I will come to later. For a while I left this film alone and did not watch it for a while. When I was looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I took VHS out of homeward bound. After watching this, I left on a normal height I could not really explain. The film gives a great sense of joy you never expect. The nature of the films of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home sends a really message to the home, no matter how different you are, you can always find common ground, something you all need. The way people are chosen is really wonderful. Through this, you have an old wise golden retriever who is knowledgeable, taking care of or giving the "opportunity" of loving love if the young, slightly clumsy American Bulldog, with the tough but weak but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions in a journey so unrealistically impossible that they create magic so that they begin to believe that this journey can take place. <br /> <br /> I do not want to look like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies assuring you that I am quite the opposite, but the most exciting part of this film is without doubt the back shadows, when the shadow desperately trying to escape and the opportunity and insolence, His departure. When both animals return to their beloved owners, there is silence until the shadows remain on the horizon. There is a fine line between the beloved and the thorny trash, but this film is pure magic even at the age of fifteen. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings but for Disney to produce such a wonderful movie using animals and in order to elevate myself in the way it deserves it in this age worth 10/10.
