"Zabriskie Point" (1970): It was interesting for me personally, because it happens under similar circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life? The anti-culture movement of the late 60 / early 70, inside and outside the campus. We follow two young men who have nothing to do with separate stories, they are slowly woven together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless perseverance in the classroom and rooms in his campus, and the other, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father and her employer, facing a "creation" job. The film is full of the visual effects of America (Michelangelo Antonioni), and the stunning films of the era. "We know everything, and we will change everything for the 'best' young people. Only who is "revolutionary"? What does that really mean? Do you wear one dress and walk around cheering? Do you "fly under the radar" but with prior notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself and deal with change without the group's approval? "Zabriskie Point" is certainly a "piece of period" - full of colloquialism, formalism, and moments of somewhat surreal film (after all, this is a film by a man who gave us the stunning 1966 film "Explosion"), and antiques of the age, but more. It offers options for a cultural revolution, and by going to Antonioni (which seems to support it), young people share themselves too much to see what is needed for radical success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful and scary film that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
