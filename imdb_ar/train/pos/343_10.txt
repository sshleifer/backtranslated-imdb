Katharine Hegel, Marley Shelton, Dennis Richards, David Borinaz. Even before I knew what this film was about, these names were enough to attract my attention. Wonderful, talented and popular, these are the performers who must search for them. <br /> <br /> Well, where do I start? We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls targeted the series "Romance", a man who refused to dance in school 13 years ago. His brands include subtle death threats disguised as Valentine's Day cards, worm-infected chocolate, and bleeding nose. Favorite Weapon: Well, take the ax, knife, wattage, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Well, it's basically a horror film with a quirky sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are not supposed to be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I adore. It's up there with some of the other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The childish creepy killer mask, seeing Cupid as she launches a bow and arrow on the victim is really terrible. Acting is the top: both Dennis Richards, Marley Shelton and David Burianaz are so much fun. I was really hoping to see a lot more, than Katharine Hegel. I am one of her biggest fans and I would love to see her doing some leading work soon. Jessica Cappshaw is a high-powered actress, and Jessica Kovil gets the glamorous blonde role she has mastered in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; she was Heddy Bowers ('bleedmedry.com') and the younger version of Dennis Richards resembled her . <br /> <br /> Highlights: Each scene has its own death. The most spectacular is the opening scene in the morgue. The sight of the hotspot, though ridiculously, was good. The audio-visual maze was sinister. The soundtrack is fantastic, with creepy music and some alternative tunes. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt as if the killer was not distinct enough, we barely saw the mask, and was never shown at the peak. I also thought that its climax was really unfocused, but enjoyable though. <br /> <br /> The change in the end was not a surprise, but I'm really happy because the filmmakers decided that this routine would leave us all ignorant of the "Killer's Explanation" routine. <br /> <br /> I do not like to tell people about the movies they should watch, but if someone asks me to choose a horror film that I thought was really worth watching, it would be Valentine. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
