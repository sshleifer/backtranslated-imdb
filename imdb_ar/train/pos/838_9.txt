*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kenner, Hop Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Sheppard. <br /> <br /> A well-formed story and film together, Brosnan was never better than a film role outside his Bond films. After 2004 "After Sunset" brings his new role to laughter and a wonderful time. The professional businessman, so to speak, Julian Noble in a job in Mexico City would end up opposite the very opposite of high-ranking businessman Danny Wright (Kenner, probably one of his best roles) in business there. The two screens on the screen produce funny and funny riots and do not fail to make jokes. Davis in one of their best roles since "American Splendor" offers a fascinating and brilliant performance. One of the most fun years and best movies. My final rating is 9/10
