Really this is a movie "hearty". She won the George Peobody Award and won the "Roots" award, so she can tell you something about the essence of this film. I'm looking online for how this film has been requested since the death of my ex-wife's father, Eugene Logan, co-author of this film a few years ago, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. . I would like to have his only daughters, my daughters, see this film, as well as convey this wonderful story to his grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old when she was on television, and since then I was looking forward to seeing her again. One of my friends said it was her favorite film. I will not spoil this film for you.
