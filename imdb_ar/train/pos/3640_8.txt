This is one of my favorite sports films. Dennis Quid moves and convinces the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball player when his arm. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the divisional championship by telling them that he will try to get out of the baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of all the beating practices they do with a coach who can play more than 90 miles per hour), and keeps his side of the deal - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've decided before to try something new and scary as an adult, the Jim Morris story will resonate with you. It is moving and inspirational, the relationships between the man a fact. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason to rent this one, though. Dennis Quaid is just a squeak in part, and a baseball movie with a well-looking man changing diapers is my idea of ​​paradise. Ladies, if you feel the way I do, make sure.
