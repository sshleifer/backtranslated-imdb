This is a very strange film by director / cartoonist Richard Williams. Everyone who knows William's work knows that he is a little elusive (if not a genius) but this one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> He is characterized by two wheeled cyclists who must rescue a new French doll for their owner from the pirate game lust and find herself at the mercy of many strange characters along the way. The power lies in this film primarily in its aesthetic quality. Her exotic personal designs, her powerful animations and her blatant contrasts between sweet and frightening. The wonderful cartoon of Williams portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real, flexible and predictable rag dolls, not simple cartoon copies of dolls, making them more believable (at least visually). The animation lights up in bringing us camel riding with wrinkles, walking her body with two different characters controlling each end, chasing silent movies with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, greed. <br /> <br /> Greedy animations, on their own, are the most pernicious cartoon I have ever seen. There is something about these animations that makes your jaw fall - and every second counts as something new. Greed lives in what was known as "Taffy Pit", a huge man who lives, lives and eats ruthlessly. Sings a song I can not help but feel some sexual tones, then tries to kill Raggedy Ann because of her heart candy. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this film is that there are so many songs. Hang down the pace of the film because there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (it was supposed to be the only song) including "I Look, What Do I See?" , "Game No Girl", "Blue" (although she did not need to make it sing twice), "I Do not Get Enough", "Because I Love You" and maybe "I'm At Home". Others seem to be unnecessary and frankly not too astonishing to hear. <br /> <br /> This is a strange film with strange tones, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not find the best.
