This film exists with classics all the time. Music, camera shots, and excellent acting. The black and white film showed a better and more complete look, like Psycho. Surprisingly how few people commented on this film. I think it's hard to find a movie. Give the movie 9. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
