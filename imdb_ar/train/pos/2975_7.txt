Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, come up with something quite different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as a basetballball. It's like basketball except that baseball rules are involved, and there's another character in the title. Here's how to play: Just shoot the ball as these two people try to divert your attention from making the shot simple. In fact, I have tried it one day. After hitting the game in the streets, it quickly becomes a great success. Who knew that two immature friends could invent a sport that became very successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very boisterous and boisterous filled with a lot of teasing violence, but it actually offers some laughs and lots of entertainment. A specific recommendation for those of you who like humorless rude humor.
