I have a two-year-old son and suffer the same condition as Johnny Kennedy. I never had the opportunity to meet him, but I did not hear anyone say a bad word about him. I hope to know to what extent this program has helped to help his colleagues who are raising awareness of this terrible situation. This man has touched people in a way that has not been able to a million charity publications. I think this should be a mandatory offer in schools. I also agree with other comments - what should I intend to do? He has taken everything that life can throw away and can still keep a sense of humor. God bless. I could not see the part that showed the change of bandages. I have enough trouble with my son.
