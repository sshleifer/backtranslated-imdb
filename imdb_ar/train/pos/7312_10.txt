It took me some time to really appreciate John Carpenter's birthday. As a child, I remember that I really enjoyed the results, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween game. But I thought the first one was slow and it took a lot of time to get to that point. I have seen this several times recently and I know now that I was wrong. Today I understand this film really, in the sense that, the full sense of this horror masterpiece. It is not about blood and injustice. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night of Lori Stroud's short life. It was the night when his injured brother returned home to finish what he had started 15 years ago. This film is supposed to be scary and I think it worked well. It is also one of the first curly films, a subtype of horror I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark climate, creepy music and talented young actors, such as Jimmy Lee Curtis in her first role. Do I need to say more? Anyone who has never been a fan of horror or not must do his cinematic duty right now. Highly recommended!
