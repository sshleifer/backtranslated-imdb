I have seen Maslin Beach several times - both on free TV in Brisbane. I will not go into whether this is good or bad or otherwise because others have covered this really well. <br /> <br /> I will say that he is very Australian. In Australia only, we can have a film about the relationships between people who spend the day naked like their birthday, and watch it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States of America who is constantly amazed at what we put on the free TV screen compared to her native country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just two examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government has tried to turn us into the 50th United States, it is good to know at least that some things are still real
