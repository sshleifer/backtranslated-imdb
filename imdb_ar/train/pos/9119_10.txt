An interesting way to look at how we behave as human beings often is that we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we sometimes destroy the basis of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue that we tend to ignore from among us who are not honest and by doing so they may miss a great opportunity. The comedy injection makes watching the movie a fun experience. You should see it for anyone interested in taking a reflective but comic look at life. I am looking forward to your next product. I hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joan
