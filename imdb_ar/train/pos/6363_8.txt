I was a fan of this series as a child, and then it always remained in my mind as one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 1980s compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois lum ... oh, most of them love). I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this type that were released later can not match the Mazinger G, as they began repeating the same boring style. <br /> <br /> This particular thing may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is his creativity, with a lot of exorbitant monsters, alien instruments and alien characters; in fact, we were keen on See each new batch to see what kind of evil villain or the new machine ahead of us!
