A spectacularly amazing amusing piece, identified in the 1930s, revolves around the classic cliffhanger chain, such as "Raiders of the Lost Ark," which was accomplished only with a low budget and many of the spoilers by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes salute a liberal amount of Gothic art Nouveau, ahead of Batman for two decades. Starring Ron Elie (Tarzan) as a great hero, and Pamela Hensley, a brilliant Latina domestic ambush attached to our hero in a gold chase in the Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best line, our hero to Mina, clutching the grip of her chin just as you expect him to be thin with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you are a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's meat and cheese flour, Captain Sees is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders ..", dash from "Batman", "The Lost World" a little, and "Lost Horizons" a bit and a lot of enthusiasm and you will get them correctly. Watch out for Michael Berman's favorite cult in a small part of the Undertaker and enjoy the camp's use of national music by John Philippe Souza. A major candidate for the DVD version, it's certainly late. A treat that does not miss out to the whole family. 9/10
