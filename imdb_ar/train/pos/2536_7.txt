The horror movies of the 1930s, which are always best remembered, are Dracula and Frankenstein, and there is good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. This plot is not particularly original, and similar plots have been seen several times before (even in 1936) but the way in which everything is assembled is certainly very fanciful, and director Lambert Hiller has created a very original horror film. The plot focuses on Dr. Janus Rukh Taybeh. Man discovered a way to re-date Earth. Led by his discovery that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off with a team of respected colleagues to find him. However, the tragedy hits during the journey, and the good doctor ends up being exposed to the element, making him glow in the dark, and sending him crazy as well ... <br /> <br /> The biggest drag of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it represents the two greatest horror stars of his time - Boris Karlov and Bella Lugosi, both of which offer excellent performances. Karloff really shows what his good actor is and his personality has a lot of flesh to raise. Bella Lugusi has a very different role from what we used to see in him, which is also a wonderful performance; it is nice to see a little diversity of Lugosi. The film begins a bit slow start; but things soon start to pick up. The second half of the film is the best, and that's really when the film becomes exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not focus on big special effects and depends largely on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; it works very well. The movie remains enjoyable all the time and culminates in a very decent climax that ends beautifully. In general, the Invisible Ray may not be one of the best horror films of the 1930s; but it is very good and comes recommended.
