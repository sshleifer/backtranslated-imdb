I found IMDb and searched this movie and almost went to tears with the comments of all the people who watched this movie as I did when I was 6 years old or so in 1967? I saw him before the Jungle Book, so I was Eagle Boy for a couple of hours and then Mukley for next year. He burst into tears on the cinema when the boy turned into an eagle and I always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home we had a grilled chicken dinner and got a wishful wish and guessed what I wish I would be? Then, my father said, "I bet you wish you were a tiger." Of course, we all know that your desires have been shattered if someone has guessed more tears and resentment to this day because he can not fly far away.
