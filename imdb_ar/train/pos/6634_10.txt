How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this film is not very amusing, but the goal is not to tell you but a story! This is the first "real" film of the history of cinema (it was the first "Le Prince de Galles" but it was not technically adequate enough ??) and has a huge international value without a doubt. These people you can watch when they finish their day in the film have the opportunity to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first people who can see themselves moving! And above all that shot is a beautiful shot! It's very exciting when you think of the first people who saw it! What an instant! (Because the Lumiere brothers invented the cinematographer for the first time for scientific reasons) and later on. Film to honor!
