After watching and liking Greg Lombardo's latest film "The Knot" (co-writing and directing this feature too), I decided to check out his previous work, and it was worth the effort and rent. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue-in-cheek, excellent for Shakespeare's favorite and updated and transported to New York City. I was impressed by the basic intelligence and intelligence of the text, and I marveled in a way that reflected the story of the production in the film - the story of the play itself - and very cleverly. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan parallels Shakespeare's play, and Central Park rarely used better than the surrounding forests of Macbeth Castle. It is clear that Mr. Lombardo has a charming place in his heart for the stories of New York and New York (Knots is a funny and warm sexual comedy about thirty-six New Yorkers, mainly located in the charming Brooklyn district, with offices in Manhattan and an upper floor in the city center for good measure) He spent a lot of time on Shakespeare's plays. The film is well written and reflects a deep understanding of the basic drama in the heart of Macbeth. "The Search for Richard" by the Pacino - another Shakespeare play "Inside a Movie" reminded me. I would recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
