As is generally known, the anthology films do not meet the American audiences (I think they prefer one standard line). New York, I Love You, is the second in a series of short films about cities and people who live and love them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really enjoyed. The film consists of several clips, each written and / or directed by a different director (mostly French, but there is a very funny clip directed by Joel and Ethan Quinn). Like Paris, this one is also a choir, directed by many different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakhar Kapoor, etc.), and also like Paris Shows with New Yorkers and why they love the city they live In which. It includes first class crews, including Natalie Portman, Chia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom and Ethan Hauke, as well as veteran veterans such as James Kan, Cloris Leitchman, Ellie Wallach and Julie Christie. Some stories really fly, others do not (although I suppose they will depend on individual tastes --- I will not spoil them for anyone else by revealing the stories that worked with me and those that did not). The word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (Is Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece not featured?). It is mainly spoken in English, but there are parts of Yiddish and Russian with translation into English. They were classified as R'by the MPAA for strong language and sexual content
