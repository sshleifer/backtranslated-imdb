This movie is very sexy and romantic. I have seen him several times and have never been bored. Everything is realistic and is a good conspiracy. The actors are excellent, Liam Nison, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I actually prefer this movie to Braveheart because Braveheart contains a lot of historical errors. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for Bridge Scen and another fencing scene. These sights are really good and surprising. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful ... it's really suitable for the film. The setting is amazing.
