I did not laugh hard on this film in a really long time. The trash brought out by Hollywood recently pushed me to the wall! This one was definitely fresh and ingenious. If you look at the demographic numbers of the labels, a few women voted! I do not want to spoil the movie for you, but I'm sure everyone who watched this ran to his computer to evaluate it and give it a bad score, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because of its true comic value and not because it is harmful to men ... it could easily be a movie "7" classified!
