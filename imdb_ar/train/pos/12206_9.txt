Of all film nouretas in the 1940s and 1950s, this rank should be one of the strangest and most watched films. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two that made this movie very enjoyable for me, especially Anders. His character, George Grisby, is one of the strangest people I have ever seen in the film. His voice must be heard, and some things he said, to believe. Slaone is not lagging behind in the "alien" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous as short blond hair, but still Hayworth, which means a lot to Google if you are young. Wales are fantastic as always. Tip: If you have a DVD, run English subtitles. His character in this film is Irish and needs translations to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the film, which means you have great camera angles and great facial shots. You also have a unique, visible end, with a shoot in the house of mirrors. Great things! Despite this strange film, I still think that the atmosphere of carnival-like clown in the trial near the end was very large and took away the seriousness of the scene. Otherwise, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful entertainment, which is the name of the game.
