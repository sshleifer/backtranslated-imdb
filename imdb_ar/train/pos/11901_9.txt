As far as I can recall, the Balanchine adjustments to Tchaikovsky's result are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last section of Grossvatertanz (a traditional tone played at the end of a concert) is repeated several times to give the children who were the last dance before the end Their scenery. <br /> <br /> 2) A single character, written but removed from Tchaikovsky's result for The Sleeping Beauty, between the end of the concert site and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its relationship to the music melody of the growing Christmas tree occurring shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> 3) The Sugar Sugar Plum Fairy was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Blanche has somehow defiled Chikovsky's great result is misplaced.
