This film is a wonderful film based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in the 1930s in Canada. I found it to be like a fixation and a heart like "Rudy" and "Awakenings". It is captured late in the life of Gray Owl and follows during its most turbulent and influential periods. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around an Indian-Canadian fisherman who finds himself promoting the plight of a besieged beaver. Land degradation and over-use of land resources are also expected. This is a shameful concept in the 1930s and was amazingly received. Become a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Pierce Brosnan seems rather strange, but not strange. Anyone who wants to discuss this point should first watch the film to understand it. Brosnan make a great performance, as do Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress and her place alongside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to forced couples in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental reasons. It is also a film for families, but children under the age of 10 (depending on maturity) will face a problem after the plot.
