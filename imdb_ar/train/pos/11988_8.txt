I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember it vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good offer. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the distinctive song. In addition, everyone was perfect cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The presentations were also of high quality. I hope some networks will bring them back so I can see each episode. Before I finish this, I would say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I saw every episode. Now, in conclusion, if there is a network that has ever restarted, I hope you enjoy it one day before it explodes forever.
