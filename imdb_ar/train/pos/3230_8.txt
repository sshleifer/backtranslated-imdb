Well, so the soldier is not as deep and meaningful as a Blade Runner or a big budget like Terminator 2, but on the whole I found it very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell has remained in character and does not speak and does a passionate act almost moments when his humanity penetrated more sadly. I found his portrayal of the emotional development restricted more tangential than Arnie in T films. (Before I got comments, yes, I knew that Arnie was cyborg and that Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same.) <br /> <br /> So, for the film itself, a reasonable American / British crew can embody this small story. I'm not really sure whether Gary Bouzi and his two bad guys or goodies, so they could not decide whether I loved them or not. The colony was not a bit more realistic, and it was not a deceptive handful of peace-loving / naive / cowardly crows who had been eliminated from the start, or a group of aggressive terrorists subversive of foreigners and others. <br /> <br /> Good Messengers Unlike other comments, I do not feel that this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike possibly escaping Los Angeles - the sequel to such volatile creatures!). Sean Pertoy is already proud of his late father by continuing to breed the noble science fiction family. The rest of the team helped explain this pathetic collection of people who had benefited from a very bad situation and had not done so badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this on a TV schedule, I recommend giving it a chance. I do not think you'll be disappointed.
