The main characters in this film fall into two categories: smart and dumb. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jerry Machik (Stana) plays a miserable, unhappy man who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get financial compensation from his former boss, the situation is out of control. <br /> <br /> While Stan is really stupid (but grainy), his friend Undereg is an absolute idiot who spoils everything and can say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa may stand the chance to roam the life with a modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be dull, but it certainly will not be without a lot of headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays the role of Zdenek, a kind of evil genius who turns into Hitler's tyrant. Zdenek and his followers try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek safe secrets. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech movies. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produced more than its share of wonderful entertainment. The best Czech movies I have seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you have seen the best in Czech cinema.
