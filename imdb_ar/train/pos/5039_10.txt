just awesome. absolutely stunning. This film about two children has a sudden vision of the father. He claims that Malakah visited him and told him that they needed to kill the "devils". He gets instructions later, and they start assembling demons, and they are ordinary people. They kill these alleged demons with an ax in the head and cut them and bury them in the rose garden. Their father claims that he can see their sins when he touches them. The film continues, with an evolution in the end. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about this film is that it fully embodies the fragility of human perception. Is their father completely crazy? Or is it telling the truth? The audience is left to make a decision. Go and make your own judgment and watch the movie. right Now.
