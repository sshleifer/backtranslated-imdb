"Spin!" <br /> <br /> The 1990s opened with Disney's favorite, "TaleSpin", a television animation series featuring characters from The Jungle Book. Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as you go to Sea Duck like never before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie, to the top of the mountains, through the woods, on the water, in the volcanoes, looking for adventure, finding treasure, looking for fun, all So in a cartoon adventure full of excitement !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was my favorite place as well as my family. This continued in The Disney Afternoon in the first half of the 1990s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on a one-off break in 1996 before I got the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> <br /> < > The good news: Today's DVD here !!!!! Live the fun and excitement in "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
