This is the story of a normal old neurotic ghost. I showed it to some of my friends at my film club and they were kept to the end! No blood or gore - just the old thrill of good style. Start from the beginning, build and build. The end is a real development that caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Well directed and behaved well. It is also a "time piece" - developed in the 1920s - that is added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by my book Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows the book closely. <br /> <br /> It is shameful that it is not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This with "Haunted" is probably one of the best ghost stories I've ever seen. Who just goes to show that a little creativity beats "your face" any day!
