This 2004 Academy Award winner is a short B / W in Spanish. A young woman enters a cafe and gets a coffee and notes a couple of musicians standing silently with their tools. All patrons are motionless, such as mannequins. One person, however, is very jolly and divides a song about what is going on at 7:35 in the morning. There is a sudden moment after another until the end and it is absolutely surprising. People, place, everything seems very ordinary. Like Bolero, the construction continues until it reaches its peak. With its structure, theme, movement and intelligence, it's an 8-minute masterpiece.
