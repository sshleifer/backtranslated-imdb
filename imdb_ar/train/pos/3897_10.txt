This video was my first exposure to Eddie Isard. We had many friends during one night and for one reason or another they had crossed a channel to HBO during the evening. Someone named Eddie Isard was working. I tried not to laugh out loud in the first few jokes. I did not want to be responsible for the rest of the group enjoyment for something that was killing me clearly. After I laughed more than healthy, she left me - as did others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, do not talk about insurance and pensions ...) We choked after that. Storylines, plotting, exotic and creative links throughout the charts are nothing short of brilliance. I've become addicted ever since to every piece of comedy I can get. His work is just genius. Comedy seems his effort. It looks like a funny friend hysterically hanging around your house and wandering around this or that ... It's a mess. It gives you the impression that humor is between you and yourself, the only real amateur of humor, after all. If you are disappointed with this video, you will not have any sense of humor before humor or humor, as they say in the UK.
