The writer Brian De Palma is famous for his series of films, somewhat unfairly called, "The Hitchcock Tradition". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not tear Hitchcock; borrowing the elements of the story or character that may have been seen in Hitchcock and then expanding it in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is famous for confusing blood-soaked death with horrible humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", which was introduced in 1980, is perhaps the most famous Hitchcockian film in De Palma, and perhaps its best also. The story includes a serial killer chasing a burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a prostitute in the street (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, this will remind you clearly. Of "psychic", but the flick de Palma is quite ingeniously artistic and creative. The sequence of the museum was recorded in particular and edited. The scene of the elevator stabbing is one of the most murderous murders ever shot. The word "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I say it certainly deserves your time. Rated 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
