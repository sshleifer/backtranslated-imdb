A very close and sharp description of the vibrant and dynamic emotional world of an 18-year-old special man, who makes his first experience in gay love for another boy, during a holiday with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this film because of its clear and precise story, with all this "acoustic proximity" and quiet moments that were full of intense mood. <br /> <br />
