It is a very beautiful film and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. But there are two missing points: - The level of stories has a great spectrum. Some scenes are very impressive and some are boring. - Many stories are not self-sufficient (if you compare coffee and cigarettes, each story contains a point, message or pipeline or whatever you want), but well, most of the stories are really good, some are pretty good and generally it's one of the best movies General certainly! <br /> <br /> Annoying, I must fill at least 10 lines, I have nothing to say and I do not want to start analyzing individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's it!
