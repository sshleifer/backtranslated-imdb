I've always loved this John Frankenheimer movie. A good scenario of Elmor Leonard The main reason for this was not just another exciting story because of Frankenheimer. His tightness and attention to small details make the difference, so he hired the porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can raise an issue made by Roy Scheider. I have always said that Robert Trebor made a great performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he is also excellent, but I really thought that Tripor was distinguished. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as other films, but it is an exciting film full of extortion, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors showing up in shaky parts. What can you say about Anne Margrethe's drug and rape? It is a pleasure to say less. Vanity has a real playful role and Kyle Preston is very young and makes an early appearance. A classic thriller should not be forgotten.
