I got a free pass to preview this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The premise seemed ridiculous and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow humor. What a great surprise. I laughed hard and cried at some jokes. This film is a must to see anyone with an open mind and a slightly cheerful spirit. Well, this is not a movie you go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or young children. The language is dirty, the jokes are raw (too), and talk about sex is drawing as you'll find anywhere. Amazing, however, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved him. Steve Carell is awesome, but (like the office) the supporting actors really make the film work. All characters have their drawbacks, but they also have depth and admiration. Everyone pulls their weight and perfect chemistry. I can not wait to get a DVD. I'm sure it will be there with office space for the restitution and quote lines.
