John Waters gave us a really enjoyable film. Sure, this is not without the stunning Waters moments, but it is quieter than the old exotic things like "Pink Flamingoes". Pecker returns to the early stage of John as it reminds the viewer of the kind of humor that was evident in "polyester." Overall, a really fun comedy with some wonderful moments!
