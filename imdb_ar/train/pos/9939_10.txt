This is an animated series where most actions are performed in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells and so on. I will not try to explain this in more detail, you just have to see it yourself: I will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this as a child in the 1980s (with Swedish voices). I spoke with a few people who were also children in the 80's and loved it too! I must admit that the educational part of the episodes did not reach me on a conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​teaching children during their fun is fantastic. I have recently seen a few episodes; there is a sense of humor and a heart that is hard to find in other children's programs nowadays. <br /> <br /> 5/5
