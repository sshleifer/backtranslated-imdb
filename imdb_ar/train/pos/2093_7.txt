This is a bit long (two hours and 20 minutes) but it contained a lot of his famous Pearl Buck novel. In other words, there is a lot of land to cover. <br /> <br /> It was a soap sometimes, but there were also some visual moments, covered by a locust attack at the end of the film. It was amazing to show. Since this movie is about 70 years old, the special effects crew in this film has done a great job. <br /> <br /> Paul Mony and Louis Rainer were award-winning representatives on their day and do not disappoint here, either giving strong performances. The only problem is credibility, where all the Koreans play in the Caucasus and some, like Walter Connolly, do not seem real. I want to see a rework of this film with representatives from all Asian countries, not for computer reasons, but to make the story look and sound more credible.
