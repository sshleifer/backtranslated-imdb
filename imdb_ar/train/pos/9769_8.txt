I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a comedy fan and comedian, but I love Whoopi. I'm also part of science fiction. Dinosaur insanity. I read for fun, but when I feel very tired or fatigued, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do so. This makes them successful in my eyes! I did not go until I did something else while it was running. Whether this assessment is "good" or not, I do not really care. No, I'm not an event. Nor am I a fool.
