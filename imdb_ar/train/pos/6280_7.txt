If you love cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful actors in the film, especially Vinnie Finney, with his usual attitude of nonsense and his difficult appearance. Others are not bad either. <br /> <br /> There are only two minor flaws in this film. First, the plot is poor, but people do not watch this film for the plot. Second, glorification of Grand Theft Auto (car crime). However, if people really think that they are able to steal a Ferrari car and stay away from it, look for them well, I hope you have a good time in prison! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was the main factor role, I first thought "... sweeet." , But then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" But then finally after watching the film, I realized "... yes it sucks!". Just joking, he plays the role well. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary review will conclude by saying: "If early death a criminal enlightened the public audience to some extent at the dark end under the bright crust of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries an innate, You must be all very lucky, you can say "poor criminal." Say: "Poor us." <br /> <br /> Note - Angelina Jolie Voyette looks so beautiful!
