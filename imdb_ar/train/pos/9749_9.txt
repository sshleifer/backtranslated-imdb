I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I certainly was not less interested in the opera at the time, but it changed my views. I enjoyed this movie very much and really enjoyed the opera ever since. So I bought several of his CDs. Who cared about his acting abilities, played his role basically, and was fantastic. I was very charming and very attractive; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I am very sad because many of them criticize him harshly. It was very straight, and he did not accept the people who paid or judged him for his actions. He deserves respect and admiration for his talent. We will definitely miss him !!!
