You know how Star Trek fans flock to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad movies? why? To see their heroes at work again. This is how I feel about Doc Savage. I am a great fan of personality, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew was an overwhelming adventure. The first 20 minutes of the film only increased the sense of anticipation. They then decided to introduce elements of a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this single film, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. There's a lot of promise here, it's been mitigated by a number of unfortunate choices (music, camp elements, etc.). But Doc's spirit is there, and that's what Doc and his team respond to us. So, in my long way, what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bad film: it's not as good as it should have been. Anybody who loves Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Pokaro Panzai, and many other characters should review this film just to become aware of the hero who inspired them all.
