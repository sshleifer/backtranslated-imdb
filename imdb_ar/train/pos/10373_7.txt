Matt Spirugulo's family (Toby Malone) is known as a talented footballer and is happy when he gets a chance to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city, his cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But cousins ​​look like chalk and cheese: one of them works on a naive farm, and the other a young man wandering the street was able to mix up with drug dealers and gangs. Matt is unlikely to spend a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> After his cousin George (Damien Robertson) misses his arrival in the city, Matt faces more trouble when the young biker takes him on a journey. In more than one way. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, widely known for his work in the theater, performs commendably as a spiritual teenager. There are clear signs of a low budget, but as with many other low-budget movies, there is more fun, which seems more automatic, and more magical, than is expected in Hollywood medium films.
