"Happenstance" is the most famous Parisian film in New York that I have seen since "when the cat is away (chat I'm Checun cherche)." <br /> <br /> Last year's film was released to take advantage of Audrey Tato's "Amelie", where his French title is more appropriate: "Le Battement d'ailes du Papillon (The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings) "As in summarizing the theory of chaos as a dominant element in our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatu's annoyance is not less troublesome here because it sometimes only shows that dazzling smile amidst her unfortunate adventures, and because she is part of a large multi-ethnic group, so great it took me a long time to settle. The characters, especially as some gentle men and older women looked alike, and some characters imagined what they should do so that I was not sure whether they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I liked how urban coincidence, from immigrants to car nests and crowded subway cars to strolling around coffee shops. <br /> <br /> The annoying sub-headlines have partially given up the dialogue at once. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 12/8/2001)
