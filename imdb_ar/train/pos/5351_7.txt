Although this film is fairly full of the 80's cowardice, I only have a place in the DVD rack and I do not know why. I think I like her because the story's moral is "TV is garbage, so shut it down and go and get a life." For those of you who have decided to listen to the message, you should try to read the book, nothing like the movie at all. To destroy it at the end of the story, Richards, mortally wounded, ends up smashing a plane in the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and closing the network at the same time. I have read this for many years but today it will be difficult not to compare it to the events of September 11.
