I have always been a fan of David Lynch. With this film, Lynch has proved to critics that he has the talent, style and technical integrity to make films outside the surreal aura of the past decade. As far as the film is classified as G, it is from pure Lynch in style, speed and tone. The film moves in a smartly hypnotized way full of feelings of passion and real power. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great, as expected from Lynch, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. It is very refreshing to see a film in which characters tell all the friendly and friendly personalities and not the motives that are clearly labeled either "good" or "evil." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth is beautifully performing like the rest of the actors, most notably Cisse Spacek in his lovable performance, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but very important role. <br /> <br /> David Lynch has proved with this film that he can make a powerful moving picture as he did in the 1980s with Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man. Critics seem to lose confidence in the past decade after producing surreal films such as "Peak Peaks: Fire Walk with Me" and "The Lost Highway." But with this film, there was a way to fowl and Luo, "Mulholland Drive," considering the high praise he received and the nomination of Oscar Lynch. <br /> <br /> A "straight story" is for me one of the most exciting animated images I have "I've seen it's a love story about family, friendship and gentleness.
