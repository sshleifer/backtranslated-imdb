This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. He behaves very well by Hanks, Newman, and everyone. Definitely the best performance of Jude Lu. Excellent cinematography, good editing, and includes a truly exquisite degree really suited to the mood of the film. Production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, overcoming the godfather needs a lot, but the great cinematic show is winning this contest. Definitely the best candidate image in my book.
