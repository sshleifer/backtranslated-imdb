Today, if someone mentions the name Victor McGlagen, the answer is likely to be "Who?" Or perhaps "why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for best actor in this film, which revolves around a desperate poor man who wants to sell his best friend to Carver to the United States. It's an interesting film that shows the low level of good-intentioned turns even for a few dollars. The film is shown in British-controlled Ireland, and while all other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for Ireland's political independence, all Mr. McLaglen's character is concerned about getting money and sugar. The film makes one wonder whether political activity is worth it because while the activist struggles to raise his point of view, many others are not only interested, they do not even know what the uproar is about. The morale of this film is: Look for a friend, he might sell you for a dime.
