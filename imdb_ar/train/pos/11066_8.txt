For a long time it seemed as if all the good Canadian actors had traveled south of the border and (I thought) that all of them of the second rank filled the top positions and left the buzz in sexual comedy. <br /> <br /> This film was a real surprise: Despite the strange plots that are typical of the festivals, the actors seemed to be trying to put something in their characters, and what we, the viewer, had restored was a real comment to believe. When the additions of the music video clip attacked the police that had been evacuated, I almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the best sex festivals (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for this out. And the big surprise, this sexual masquerade is full of some very good nudity.
