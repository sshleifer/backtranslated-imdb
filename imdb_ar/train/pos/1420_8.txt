In celebration of Earth Day, Disney released the movie "The Earth". We stopped sending any gloomy message of gloom and death. We treated some excellent shots of the animals in their habitat without feeling too bad about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears, whales and a leg. The narrative begins in the Arctic and continues south until we reach the tropics, where it is displayed all the time to the inhabitants of the different climatic zones that have been crossed. <br /> <br /> Global warming has been mentioned as we see the polar drift taking place. Note: Sea ice islands have shrunk in recent years. We never see bears taking any seals, but the father's desperate search for food leads to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The air shots of the city of Caribou, which flies through the tundra, are one of the most exciting wildlife scenes I have ever seen. It is the last of the migratory wild birds enough to reward the price of admission to see it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The disappointments I felt were that wonderful shots of the big white sharks that used to take the seals in another way were filmed. slow motion. You never feel there is one property for wild animals; its speed is incredible. The idea of ​​slowing down the film began to deliver a great speed and I think it (or at least it is the first I remember seeing) the TV show "Kung Fu" during the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect is that as credits pass through the end, some presentation of the filming techniques used is revealed. There are dramatic moments, humor and guidance in this film to make it a powerful choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective adjustments (which, as they were, saved us from the horrible end of the predatory moment) and the fact that these shots were released in 2007 and available on DVD, it is a powerful film in itself. And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three Stars.
