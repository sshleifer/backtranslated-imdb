The original DeMille film was produced in 1938 with Frederic March. Really very good movie. Brings us the love of Hollywood from the re-production of a fairly interesting movie starring Yul Brenner. Of course it was wonderful because it almost always appeared in all his movies. Charlton Heston in the role of Andrew Jackson was a genius blow. However, the film tends to get long in places. Does not move quickly in 1938. Still, it's a fun movie to watch at least once.
