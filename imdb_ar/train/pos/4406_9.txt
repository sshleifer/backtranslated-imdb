Strangely, this film did not reach the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video version. My expectations are high but they are by no means disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there is a wonderful representation, a clever and exciting plot that makes you guess well until the end and a wonderful shot. Along with Unforgiven, this is easily one of the best two Westerners of 90. <br /> <br /> People who expect something along Mel Gibson's mile in the Patriot (Braveheart) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sadly disappointed , All others who appreciate the qualities above will have a wonderful time watching it. 9 out of 10.
