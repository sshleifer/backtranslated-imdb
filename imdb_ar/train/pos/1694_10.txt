If the filmmakers made any attempt to bring reality into the plot, it was simply a waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, by subtracting all the excuses of the reality of the wind, they created a comic marvel. Who can pass a film where a foreign pilot spends the entire film acting like Jack Nicholson, with a Takers T-shirt. Do not reject this film as garbage.
