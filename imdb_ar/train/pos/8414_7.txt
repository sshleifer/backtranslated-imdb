"Prague Student" is an initial feature film, or "automatic film" (ie, an author's film). This film is a member of a movement that includes many movements that tried to bring respect to cinema, or just make a profit, by adapting the literature or theater on screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with good animation. Using the poem Alfred de Musette and the story of Edgar Allen Bo, it focuses on the theme of doppelg√§nger. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film's most popular films are the effects of double exposure to make Paul Figner appear twice inside the scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects processor for his day, but he was not good at putting the camera or moving it. Film researcher Leon Hunte (printed in "Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narration"), however, has made an interesting analysis about this film using the frame to amplify the doubles theme: the characters are divided by left / right, near / far and jib / diagonal framing Of characters and stills. Regardless, the film consists mostly of long shots extended from a fixed location, which is remarkably primitive. Worse still is the lack of editing; there is very little dissection of the scene and the scenes lingering. None of this was unusual for 1913, but there were more films developed in this regard at about the same time, including the best parts of the film "Atlantis" (August Blom, 1913), "Twilight of a Woman's Soul" (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913) and short films of Griffith DW. <br /> <br /> Expanded vocabulary for a global film by 1926 would allow for a superconfiguration. Moreover, the new version is a cause of personality Lyduschka, other than being problematic and alternative forums. Here, the gypsies are cleverly dressed, with a mantle of concealment. I know that their world is silent for me, but I assume, with their lips moving and so, that their world will not be silent to them, how can Lyduschka throw on the shoulders of others and not to notice? <br /> <br /> However, this is one of the most interesting early films in theory. Vigner, who appears to have been the main reason for this film, as well as lead role, will later play the lead role and co-directed "The Golem" in 1920 - helping to launch the extraordinary thread in German silent cinema. <br /> <br /> (Note: The first version I saw was about an hour long (definitely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with sometimes bleaching faces and so on.I'm not sure since then, I also saw a DVD DVD, which is missing in the 41st minute of the footage in the above publications and also has fewer and very different ownership cards, but not so visually.
