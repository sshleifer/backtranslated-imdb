Every time I see Nicole I love her more. I like a movie like this. A woman will not give up, but it continues to break your heart. The first film I remember seeing was Human Humanage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. Beef about the health of the Russian language spoken in this trivial film, it has been good to fool me or anyone else does not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss this point. Russian players who are not very popular were also well represented. Finally, I have to attach my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else noticed, he plays in sap with great dignity, and there was certainly some heat between him and Nicole. To think, men are paid for it.
