The question is, can a movie really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I took this in a video shop for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box contained the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron is a high quality brand since it first got the legendary "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984" . We did not expect a film full of winning as this film was. Your basic plot is as follows: Grange, this Goombaesque thief from the planet, steals the "Moon Bank" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I do not remember the name of the planet) until he takes mines of bauxite and other minerals. The "governor" of the said colony and his miner use the prisoners to work. Walker, a hunter favored (seems to be one of only three on the whole planet) reminded prisoners that it was inevitable, because there was only one shuttle outside the entire planet and he had to deal with it. Then there is the anonymous "Colonel", a retired bonus hunter suffering from a painful recurring nightmare. Most of the films revolve around "futuristic" car chase (dunebuggies with plywood on both sides) with many blasts. The planet itself is suspiciously similar to Hemet OCA or one of the other "inner empire" outposts. But what makes the film really shine is amazingly fantastic soundtrack that includes many Los Angeles music bands in the mid-1980s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was compressed on vinyl, but it is definitely worth buying the film for soundtracks only. I can not even remember the names of the teams (in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I had heard before I watched this movie, but I certainly look forward to them. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time, and it would be best to enjoy it with 12 packets of beer and a few of your close friends.
