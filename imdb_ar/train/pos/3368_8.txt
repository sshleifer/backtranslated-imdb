Hitler's visit to Rome is the background to the story of giving love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays a housewife and mother of six children staying at home while her whole family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She must stay at home because the family can not afford a maid. She wanted to go though she was with the entire residential complex where she lived an enthusiastic admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> There is one exception. Across the courtyard Marcelo Mastroiani sits on his chair thinking of suicide. Reason? He's gay and because of that he recently lost his job as a radio broadcaster. The film really begins when these two people meet by accident. Mastroianni in a state of despair and desperately need a friend. Lorraine, who was frustrated by her deceptive husband misunderstood Mastroiani, and in a wonderful shot, directed directed acts on the rooftop of the building complex, exposing her body to him only for rejection. The initial shock is replaced by a short period of hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, homosexual, this other world who desperately wants to give her everything she craves. <br /> <br /> This beautifully made movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is represented by caliber when she is well directed. It is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, above all, the humanitarian situation. Despite its sad end, there is a glimmer of hope in the conclusion, but things will change, and someone has understood them.
