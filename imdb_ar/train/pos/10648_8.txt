What can I say that he did not say about "haunting"? It has everything that would make a wonderful picture. They were wonderful collections, moody music, and sound design to die for everything in place. Scenario, though, sometimes baffles the mind in a strange, surreal way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy creating CG effects and creating gothic groups to see how weak the plot was. Every member of the team performs well, although there is little conviction on the material. Lily Taylor has the most to do while others interact. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was fun for a couple of hours, but you definitely want more. Much more.
