Fifty years later, this comic musical fantasy may seem in his time, but he wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still very enjoyable. Crosby was never a romantic lead, but he delivered the material with the comic edge he needed. Bendix plays wide and very enjoyable in a part that calls for his strength. Hardwicke - How much joy for a Knight of the World - the real one - to throw himself in such caperings with this abandonment. Ronda Fleming herself enjoys the least exciting major roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints as Merlin is unconvinced. <br /> <br /> Although it is not musical, the songs are very good, and the routine "Dancing" accompanying Busy Doing Nothing is ideal - funny, appropriate and polite without being a challenge, and make a virtue of the musical Crosby movement that, Let us be fair, by nature amusing because it is not the greatest force. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a bit muddy in some places. The story - well, you need some liberties with the original, but I think Mr. Clemens may have been happy with the result.
