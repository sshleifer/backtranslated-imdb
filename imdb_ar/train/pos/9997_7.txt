Life Stinks (1991) was less than the other Mel Brooks. Starring as a rich man waging a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live a homeless man for a month. His friends, shocked and amused, accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" at Bowery, he meets a group of strange displaced persons, one of whom is caught by his imagination (Lesley-Ann Warren). They fight a friendship and learn many of the tricks she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being rich and filthy? Will they win this unconventional bet? Who are his true friends? See when you're seeing LINE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie has been slaughtered unfairly. Certainly not as classic as his previous films but it is still fun. I liked the way Mel Brooks praises Charles Chaplin in this film. If you have seen the previous silent films of Chaplin, you will also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
