I have not seen much of Colombo movies really ... In fact, I think I saw only one or two films, regardless of this film. I always liked Colombo in a way without even seeing much of it. Peter Falk was and remains the perfect choice for personality, because of his appearance, voice and charm. The best proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, only the latest (and probably not the last) films were produced in 2003. This is 35 years old. Falk was forty years old when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films (unless my account is stopped), all made for television. Everyone knows this character, although no one has ever seen a film in the cinema. This is a great achievement, if you ask me. The plot is very good. The only problem I face is that the killer and the murder were initially revealed (although this may be the same for all Colombo movies), without leaving any ambiguity but how Colombo solves it, making it somewhat boring (because there is not much To look forward to at the end of the film). The speed is good, there is hardly a scene where you feel bored. The acting is very good, especially the work of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialogue in the film. The characters are well written and credible. Dialogue and scenario are unusually useful for a television movie. All in all, the film is surprisingly good for a television movie, and definitely worth watching for any of Colombo's fans and / or clicks of crime / mystery. 10/08
