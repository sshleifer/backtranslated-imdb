The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Given the number of people who are famous or soon to be in the film, one wonders how to overlook it. This is a slow and temperamental story, but it is moving about a tragedy that is affecting the family of the farm. The film is somewhat an indictment of the Midwest's stoic values ​​and suppression of emotion. The film will not be suitable for all tastes, but anyone who can appreciate the true human drama likes to be good. <br /> <br /> In the first moments of the film, we see two brothers heading early in the morning to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if you are lucky. As he climbed through a fence of barbed wire, the gun was accidentally discharged and the little boy shot his older brother in a lethal way. It seems that these boys never took a training course on the fisherman's safety. The way two men can pass correctly through such a fence with one rifle is as follows: The first man climbs through it. The second man then passes him through the gun fence. The first man then puts the gun and helps the other through the fence. In no time, neither of the two men should have his hands on the gun and the fence. <br /> <br /> However, as soon as his brother was killed, Arnold, 12, returned to his own world. He does not even run for help after shooting his brother. He simply goes ahead and picks peas and tells his family about the incident later. Arnold does not seem to show any remorse or sorrow at all during the funeral or interrogation. His family seems to be moving away from him. They may be angry at him for killing his brother. Frederick Forest's wooden uncle is apparently disturbed by Arnold, although the death of the older brother allows him to beat the girl's girlfriend. Arnold's parents do not seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really are not trying to talk to him. About the only person who can communicate with him is his grandfather, who plays with great skill and style by Wilford Primley. After a while, Arnold moves with the old timer. <br /> <br /> Arnold does not seem to be opening up to a strange trip on the way to Reno Nevada to look for his former cousin's wife in an incomprehensible way. Once interviewed, he begins to get out of his cortex after apologizing for breaking her marriage by starting all family disorders with the accident. From here on, the film becomes a quick study of reconciliation and awakening. <br /> <br /> Acting is painfully distant in most cases. Robert Duval and Glenn Clos make parents on the farm. Forrest is good, but perhaps trying hard to steer Paul Newman's performance in the hood. Cinematography is also exceptional. If you like moody images of ordinary people, this picture may be right for you. Some may recommend getting some tissue. 5 of 5 stars Reviewed 9 October 2011 Google Translation <br /> <br /> The Hound.
