This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel very moved by the subject the film intends to convey. One sentence that continues from my mind is that "history repeats itself." When people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents and their husbands; people have every excuse not to share the best time with their children until it's too late; people must always work hard to support the entire family but are prone to ignoring the covert feeling of their partners; People always change their views at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is filled with love for their loved ones; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world. It is not too late to talk with their parents about what they feel Deep in their hearts to achieve a better understanding Insatiable, so as to be life to end the day, people should not feel sorry or regret because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. The actors and actresses are wonderful. They fully understood the director's intention. The magic of the film, for me, is to influence the bringing of a wonderful and delightful mix of chants and tears to the audience.
