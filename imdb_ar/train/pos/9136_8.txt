This is not a bad film like some critics, and as the summary says in the IMDB page of this film, it is. why? First, the fact that filmmakers in 1984 were bold enough to deal with the problem of domestic violence, as critics who complain about the plot unfortunately lack one of the key points! Second, without an element in Prince's relationship with his abusive father, the musical peak will not work as well - so reviewers who say music is good are once again missing a point - specifically, why it's good. .. Because all the music in this film has a background plot element that makes the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For film producers and directors for the first time, this is not bad! There are far worse movies than people making the movie !! Finally, reviewers who say that "good" music has missed this point - check out a range of stylistic music, variety, music, and theatrical performances of the Prince - one of a kind really, go musically where there was no one else going in the 1980s, In the style seen in the works of other artists (clothing and movement: what are the most prestigious elements that ranked first, or Michael Jackson or Prince, too, see if you can detect the fingers that are gripping the eyes before the eyes of the Prince in this film, Long of "Pulp Fiction" by Quentin Tar Taino. The sum of its parts, a film is not bad at all.
