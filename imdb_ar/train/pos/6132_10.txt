I am happy because users (from this date) who are impressed with this film are now coming forward. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - they seem to have been expecting a serious treatment (?!?!?)! Come on, how the hell can you take the premise of a deadly snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew that this was a silly idea, and they did not try to deny it. The direct delivery of the viewer makes it funny! Yes, there are times when low budget shows (such as the explosion scene) appear, but I think the expensive look would have taken from the movie fun! So, if you love B movies, and the idea of ​​the idiot appeals to you, you will definitely love "Jack Frost".
