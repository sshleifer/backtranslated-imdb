What a pleasant surprise: the Disney sequel (directly to the video) which is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedic story that includes the favorite meerkats and pigs, Timon and Pumba. It starts with watching the original film and making comments, so Timon complains that "we're not here yet." After fighting on the remote control, Timon and Bumba decided to tell the audience "their story". They start the new film, and laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope in Disney. Most of the direct fare to the video was awful, as the story lines were desperate to take advantage of the original. "1 1/2" decides to experience something different: tells the original story from a new perspective. Well, he adds some things, like where Timon came from and how he and Pomba met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella restore the friendly friendship that made us love in the first film. There is also some parody of the films (including one scene that spoils at once "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke"), and the program is filled with funny and memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added to the actress is Julie Cavner ("The Simpsons") as the timid mother Timon of concern, and Jerry Steller as Uncle Max Maxon. Matthew Broderick appears in the image of Simba, and reminds me of his "adolescent" scene of Fries Fowler. Everyone works well, especially Robert Gilamy (do you spell it?) Like my companion, who sinks more and more in this film (Timon comments on this several times). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is a perfect alternative for those who are tired of Shrekification of animation. 10/10
