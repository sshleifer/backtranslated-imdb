I did Disney again. A great way to bring Timone and Pumbaa back to life is to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needs them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. He explains how Timon lived with his family and fellow Merkats before he set out to find the home of his dreams and adventures. Then he meets Bomba and things change. They are looking together for the house Timon wants and fails again and again, which is funny because Timon gets crazier. Simba then appears and sees his childhood more than we have seen in the previous two films. The rest, you already know.
