A surprise rent at a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Old Stone Killers" and almost as annoying. I think it went well with my view of being late in 2004 watching the Republicans. Is this a magic thing for the majority of US television viewing? The question begs, "Are we really manipulating this?" <br /> <br /> It is definitely a perverted view. There was also a larger theological question provoking - the story of Christ. Can verbal expression and overwhelming reliance on something exploitative because television produces a Christian? Was the story of Christ exaggerated? Can be fully fabricated? It is something the film places in a very conscious light.
