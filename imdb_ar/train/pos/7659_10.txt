I just finished watching this movie, which angered me a lot. I went to South Africa almost twice, soon to make this film. <br /> <br /> It's certainly tough, and the opening scenes tend to "adjust the scene". The slow and steady increase in frequency does not allow a break, and there are certainly a few light moments. <br /> <br /> You will never see Nigel Hawthorne again. He appeared as a very quirky individual, and I found myself more disliked every time he showed up. <br /> <br /> I fully agree with Steve Thumb's detailed and well thought out comments.
