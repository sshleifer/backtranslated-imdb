The summer was full of blockbusters and movies, not to mention some disappointments from those returns, so much so that I was upset to find a movie I could sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to read more at the bottom of the page (there were no spoilers), I will summarize it here: it is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there is doubtful violence parts, lots of death, a handful of scenes with little Of blood, not for young children), but do not try to be overly vulgar or beyond their limits. Think of it as a little more serious and more charming than the princess of the bride will be soon. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I, perhaps, are not movie pioneers like others ... maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active . I am also a great fan of science fiction / fantasy. I've been bored by reproducing the lines of recurring stories and films in more than fill colors faster than they can be up to 10, and this film is rough diamonds. <br /> <br /> By the end of August, he was tired enough of the broken expectations of the big visits avoided by the sight of Born Altimatum for Stardust. After my hopes were completely puzzled by Transformers because of my addiction to fantasy, the Stardust previews looked attractive, but I was definitely cautious. <br /> <br /> Just as I felt a lot of others here, I was completely surprised. I was thinking of watching a movie Clichy a year of fantasy until breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale, it's already a witches and witches and it absolutely requires a suspension of disbelief ... but the most refreshing thing is that it is not based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, which is actually a really good movie. <br /> <br /> (Unlike 90% of other films that seem to reappear like thorns on the side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I can read this year's book, and within two years the film will be out of " An epic epic story, like LotR and the rest, "the New York Times says, as well as doubt.) <br /> <br /> Stardust did not have my comment on my seat because of the jam-filled movement at every turn, Earth after threatening the plot by threatening to tear dramatic tension apart from the echo throughout the theater in a resounding boom. They did not even use huge bursts of sound to draw my attention to what was happening on the screen (Transformers, I look at you). It does not try to show the latest CGI technology, nor does it offend my imagination through dialog boxes and lines of story so simple that I was able to figure it out in the third grade (a boy I hate). <br /> <br /> I just watched. I watched, and enjoyed a refreshing creative story unfolding before my eyes. Sure, you probably know what was going to happen during most of the movie, but that makes you forget it. It made me feel happy in some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed was that I left the theater better than I was when I went. <br /> <br /> It's really a gem. After a lot of mind this summer with many new movies and movies that did not live up to my expectations, this was like a cup of sweet cold tea to beat all the hard work I was doing while I was sitting through others trying to get them out of my money. <br /> <br /> This may not be useful for everyone, but for your benefit; if you enjoy fantasy movies that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Caddron, Dark Crystal, etc.) you should see this movie Oh really. This little diamond finds its way into my DVD collection the moment the stores hit, you can trust me in this. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
