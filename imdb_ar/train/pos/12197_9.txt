It could have been the final film of all time, and Columbia Studios did not cut many original Orson Welles movies. What we have left is a flawless but wonderful film that shows the overwhelming talent of the Wales as actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious thriller. <br /> <br /> "The Lady From Shanghai" is a noir film in most sizzling and confusing. In an unequal tone, Willis depicts Michael O'Hara, an Irishman, who finds himself after a fateful encounter with the dangerous seductive Elsa Panister (Hayworth, in a superb performance) and is actually forced to accept a job as a crew in her aunt and her paralyzed husband (Everett Sloan). Elsa, or "Rosalie" as Michael likes to invite her, plays the role of the innocent innocent puppet, replaced by O'Hara on her website. While the lovers have a secret relationship at sea, Arthur Panister's partner at the law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) comes. Michael offers a unique proposition: he will receive $ 5,000 to help Grisby in forging Grisby's death, so it appears to be a murder. The plan is to get Michael out of the technology and run in the sun with Elsa. But things are not going according to plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth provides us with one of the best dead women of all time in a very mysterious picture. Sometimes, they seem really weak and resemble children, and at other times brutal, exhausting of the world and difficult. She is always very beautiful, whether she is dressed in a swimsuit or wearing black clothes and waving a gun. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and is far from her famous role "Gilda". Her husband, Orson Wells, then cut off her trademark locks on a dyed blond crop (angered Colombian President Harry Conn.). It was a wonderful marketing ploy, and a suitable change changed its attitude beautifully. She is not the compassionate emotional girl represented by "Gilda" here - instead she is a predatory woman with a black heart who sees murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The pairing between Welles and Hayworth came at a time when the couple were having serious difficulties in their marriage. They would divorce after the film was produced, so this is a curiosity to offer some insight into the complex relationship. They love hate, not romance, so it's hard to tell if they have real chemistry on the screen or not. Surely every encounter is strong and full of bustling sex, with Wales as a "falling man" (so he admits himself in the film!) And Rita as a double cross girl. <br /> <br /> The character of Welles is a typical Noir "stray" with a lot of meaning. As Wales' voice proves, O'Hara does not use his brain too much. "We expect to think about it (Elsa)." Wells used to play smart and charismatic colleagues, so his role here is that Michael TheDateDate is unusual and very interesting. In fact, Wales was a representative of high talent and swallows it well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloan is seen as a paralyzed husband in Hayworth. One wonders why Michael hires. It is clear that his wife is interested in him romantic, so why call for "threat" on board the plane? One explanation may be that Michael offers "service" to his wife that Bannister can not in his broken state. There is certainly something of this theory, with much of the consequences of Elsa's behavior before she meets her husband (was she a kind of prostitute?) And learns Grisby the secrets of the most intimate Bannister secrets that are hinted at in many scenes. <br /> This complex mixed movie with a flawed plot in the end. We are interested in the love triangle more than the murder plot, as with most voices. Welles provides us with many of the usual cinematic touches, including the famous "Hall of Mirrors". It is a wonderful scene, its end that can almost eliminate mistakes early in the film and raise it to greatness. This delightful home scene is visually stunning, with a Dali-like feeling for painted sets (it seems that Orson painted it himself). The hidden visuals used by Wales in the film reinforce the plot and make this experience thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is hot and confusing, it is superbly presented by the low-pitched Rita sound alternately and without stunt, and the high accuracy of a small girl's voice. Hayworth has demonstrated its representational abilities in this game, and proves that SHE is the ultimate cause of Noar's rolls. It's unfortunate (only one minor, as Rita was a great dancer) that she did a lot of pleasant, forgetful and often forgotten musicals of Colombia in the 1940s instead of its dark-colored lights. She was a wonderful actress when she had the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
