I am a fairly big fan of most of the films based on Steven King's books - this is one of the most horrifying and memorable films. <br /> <br /> I've just finished watching it for about 10 seconds and still find it painful and frightening. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is in a certain collision course with the monster truck is the scene. And "No Justice" by which the little Mico Hughes pronunciation near the end is a touch of intelligence. <br /> <br />
