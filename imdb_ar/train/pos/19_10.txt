I just read TomReynolds2004 comments and feel I have to jump here. I understand that he does not like the film, but its causes are unclear. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to walk in the dark ways of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two individuals, as photographed, has many reasons for tension and anger, yet finds comfort and comfort in each other. Only great representation can make this work without becoming emotionally, emotionally and happily mired. I became really interested in these people because of the overwhelming humanity they gave them through these powerful performances. I have all the reasons why Jane Fonda hated her work in the Vietnam era, but with her personal feelings, she is wonderful in this role. Robert Dineiro is wonderful as a man whose intelligence and goodness have failed in a world that does not care about his abilities. This is the first time I've seen DeNiro uses compassion rather than toughness to sell someone and really liked me. This film was a big surprise when I first saw it and I look forward to seeing it again.
