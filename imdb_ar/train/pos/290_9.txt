"All the evil needs are to do nothing," Edmund Burke said. Hollywood often gives us waste because there are not enough families to watch good movies. This film was an upscale story of the loss of faith and its restoration. He had neither violence nor violence and did not deserve to be rated PG. The western scene was well shot, and some of the views were breathtakingly breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but they were probably credible and talented. The music score was very high, and in some places the dialog box sank completely. I was rarely surprised by the endings of the films anymore, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes good men win, and they win honest efforts. We loved the movie and the message, and we would recommend it to the whole family.
