I have seen this dozens of times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw her at B & W on the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for kids to see and watch. They do not know history at school, which explains the most important event of the 20th century. Broadens their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> In a neutral way, explaining to participants from all sides their own words of what they did and why, he explains in detail what led to war and actual war. <br /> Buy it for your children, along with Alistair Cooke's America. Watch it with them, and make them understand. You will be very happy I did.
