When people ask me why I love movies a lot, I usually answer, "Have you seen the sequence of the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone, represents pretty much everything I want to see in a movie. If you are a film director, this will be the thing I would like to do. "Pure Cinema" is one way to describe this sequence, and it is amazing to see how the entire film of De Palma works with the same high artistic frequency. It is a dream-like film, as intelligent as hell, and with enthusiasm and intelligence more than a dozen movies have been assembled. I think the film raises an important point that will always be the subject of a hot debate: Can the film be based solely on technology and still be considered a technical success? The film has no message to speak about, acting great but in service of elegance, and the scenario is short of logic. De Palma makes a really good case that, when handled properly, this style can preserve a long film. Certainly, Michael Caen, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon offer great performances, but this film is directed by the director to the end. It's an exciting show of medium-film possibilities. I do not want to tell you about Hitchcock's movie, "I do not want to spoil any surprises." But I believe that De Palma is beyond the arc of the story and is capable of creating a film that sums up his entire career. Not for the faint of heart!
