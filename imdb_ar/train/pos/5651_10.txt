I was a bit weird and I drank and enjoyed it a lot, and the characters at the show were also wonderful and praised each other very well. I was sorry to see him cut .. I loved to see where you could go. I found yourself leaning towards Luke Lucas, a sheriff, who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was scary and tempting. I wished I could see more of him and how he became his character. However, I would buy the program to enjoy only, it was something great for something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was the cousin of Caleb, were a great mystery regarding the place and what it meant to Lucas. It is shameful that he still exists .. or never finished, I would love to see what was going to happen.
