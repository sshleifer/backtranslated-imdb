I sit through films like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. The admiration that this film has caused me goes beyond my interpretation, because I am watching the scenes of the film and looking inside my thoughts about the ideas of making films and the innovations of dialogue that can arise from something bigger than the mind of Damien Zephron. Looking for the environment, relentlessly, simple, I think; this man is a genius. No wonder he invented what was the best television program ever seen in Argentina, and then a first film full of elements that some contemporary directors have not achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name, I woke up (a few years ago), enthusiastic of the daily cinema. <br /> <br /> His journey began from the real everyday life of people, where Szifron goes to where Pablo Trapero never goes in the "El Bonaerense"; the life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero was a journey to the man's mind and experiences, not to the places he saw. Yes, there has been detailed training and a lot of criminal positions, but Szifron's "there" is more of a detective story, like those we know and love, with mysteries and erotic music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his writings, and we are shown to achieve it through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors of great caliber in the film, but these are the two actors that the film can not do without. The first character (Louis Locke) is a detective who just discovered his wife cheating on him; he must work on the case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist assigned to treat the detective. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the dean takes advantage of time-wasting and suggests he joined Diaz in his routine: "Nothing, the usual things; no problem." But it is even bigger, revealing part of the character of a doctor he did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two lists can not be explained unless they are observed, because it is about this complexity that illustrates the talent of some men like Zephron, who today try to leave a signature in our history. Access to points of incredible spontaneity, during high stress, tells Diaz Silverstein: "How do we continue to treat us?" "I'm not your doctor, you're calling me for dinner; I'm your friend," Silverstein replies. "We laugh because we can not help him. <br /> <br /> We can not make fun of laughter when Diaz hits a street car and does not give it importance, when all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes a pot in police patrols and can not be believed by Silverstein (but then Also smokes because it is taut); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with the friends of the DÃ­az thief. The magic of Diego Preti is what we receive there. He, the psychiatrist himself, performs in the "Locas de amor" plan, but admires all his collection. Luis Loki on the other hand, returned to the track through first-rate photography reminiscent of the great actor who is it. <br /> <br /> I have a passion for this, and as I said, I can write about this for hours, but unfortunately, this is not the way you should work and I have to be precise and summarize it. Although I have to watch and study a lot of old films, I emphasize that "Tempo de Valentines" is the comedy that Argentina was waiting for and never got.
