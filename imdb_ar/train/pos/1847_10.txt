Whatever you become in your life, you should not forget to have roots. This is the story of the real facts that turned into a beautiful and touching film! I dare say that this film has been underestimated well. This shows us a fact of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better you become. Trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live happily ... without grudges, without living "under a rock." The concept of the film is more interesting ... Linking storytelling with real life events ... Keep us informed of everything .. From facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! I see it, I recommend it to all the young people. It's not about racism, it's about how you live!
