This early, black-and-white film, Sirk melodrama, is a secondary film, but it shows the German director's tendency to promote tired story lines into something like art. Barbara Stanwyck was appointed in 1910, a woman who made the mistake of abandoning her husband and family in a small town to lure the Chicago stage. She never returned to the city she had left with an anxious message from her daughter telling her that she too had occupied the theater (that is, the production of a high school). Once again in her old hometown, she once again faced a small mind, and she had to deal with her aggressive daughter-in-law, her irate husband (Richard Carlson) and her former lover. This plot is not new, but Sark identifies himself by creating meaningful compositions, with each frame carefully filmed, and he is assisted immeasurably by setting Stanwyck as his master. This process takes 76 minutes, and this is also true, because the material does not contain legs to go further.
