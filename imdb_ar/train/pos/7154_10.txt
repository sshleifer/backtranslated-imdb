I found about the movie "Holes" when I heard from people that it was not a typical Disney, both young and old alike entered the story. People, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. The "holes" are based on Louis Sacher's novel and follow the adventure of Stanley Yellens, a boy sent to a strange detention camp in the desert. He endorses a boy called Zero and together they embark on an adventure change their lives. It was a very exciting story, unique, different and funny. I did not know what to expect when I saw him. It was interesting to see the story assembling as pieces of the puzzle. The boys who played juvenile delinquents were very funny and John Voight was funny like Mr. Sidi. Now that I've seen the movie, I must read the book. Most recommended!
