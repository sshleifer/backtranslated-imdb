In 1979, I was a 12 year old boy, my parents had we got a box office at home which was very new in our area. As a 12-year-old boy, this was the first time I had seen a breast on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. The racing cars, the total ass that was wiped out with the bad guys, the waterbed, the herbal smoking, the hot 70s and the love in Chevy van are all new to me. A full movie with all the memories you can hope for. I own it and enjoy it around once a year. When I watch this movie, it makes me want to get my skis, with 4 wheels, not in the strait line, go to the park and chase some children with feathery hair. Truly wonderful memories of a teenager!
