I caught this late night movie on the cable and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this film was not better known, because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the subject of sexual abuse, it is a good disposition film, interesting and very interesting. Both Richard Gere and Claire Dines are very good at it. Although the subject is not about heart weakness, the film is not too brutal (for example, 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who enjoys Serial Killer and thrill type movies.
