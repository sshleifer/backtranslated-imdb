Cross-eyed is the original film and very funny. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to this kind of comedy and reinvents it in a good way. This film is smart, concise, fun and constantly enjoyable. As a writer / director, Jones shows complete control over his silly and beloved characters. The story is definitely something you have never seen before which is good. It is unique and fun, and it is able to work in visually stunning elements as well as the long lost genre that is raised along it to form an appetite comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
