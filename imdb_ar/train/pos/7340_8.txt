This animation has a simple and very straightforward plot against evil, and everything about work. What distinguishes it from other animation is the extent of animation of human movements. It was really nice to see the woman walking by on the screen from left to right and looked around me, and her movements were very good. Why do not they use this technique more often these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> In its prehistoric environment and women in tight clothes, Fire and Ice was clearly dedicated to showing the beautiful girl in distress in different and exciting ways. Her bright body was a safe haven for the eye . Some may hate this and regard it as another male fantasy, and others (including many women) love it for aesthetic quality. I definitely did not mind! Bakshi likes to just motivate the lush and ridiculous children, as can be seen in Cool World, and I do not think he should apologize because he is a moving cartoon for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This was a very special show, quite different from the standard fare from Disney or Anime, and for that reason alone is worth seeing since. It's probably the best Bakshi. For those who like animation with women leaflets: Try Space Adventure Cobra as well. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
