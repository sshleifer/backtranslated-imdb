I really wonder how this show plays in the UK and the rest of Europe. It's very quiet about being an American (especially White Americans). This may be a major cause of some toxins and vitriol expressed here in this forum. I love the show, but with some reservations I feel it has been easily exit by Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Crash and burn everything at the end of the second season. Jolie slammed the door shut in hopes of reviving the show unless her character landed on a haystack in the middle of some farms. Who do you know? It was a scary, funny and funny show at times.
