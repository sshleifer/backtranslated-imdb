A piece of the fierce work and brilliant intelligence of talented British writer Hanif Qureshi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (this is the best thing he has done since). It's about smart people who do not add much to their lives. They wasted what they gave and empty containers to a great extent. The only character on the screen is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside to be seen by a witty man who has measured some affection and awakened her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with great compassion. This is a film where people and places feel familiar, with characters outside the screen. In some respects, it is somewhat similar to "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it is more rigorous. The director, Roger Michel, allows the viewer to build the instinct. And behave beautifully. <br /> <br /> The mother named Ann Reid loses her lost life in every gesture. There is no wrong observation in her unusual living performance, and this wonderful actor Daniel Craig displays the shadows on his personality so that he has not been used by Koreshi. If the film is about a false observation, it is likely that he is in the character of his daughter who does not know the talent, has fallen in love with the man who teases his mother (or should be in the opposite direction), even a more chaotic life, but played Well by Katharine Bradshaw it hooks you up with it. The film is also very nice to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must be rated, without hesitation, as the best British film of the year.
