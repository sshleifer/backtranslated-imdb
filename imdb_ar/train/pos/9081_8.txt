If you love sci-fi, monsters, and old legends, you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Special effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park arrived on the big screen years ago. Although representation may be less desirable, the storyline and its effects have been adequately compensated. <br /> <br /> I wish now that I had seen it in movies on a theater screen instead of a 42-inch screen TV screen. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, great photos, taste the legend and tradition .... you have to see this movie !!
