This is a very difficult film, and it is almost impossible to deal with what is going on. At first, it seems to be a pedestrian film about a man (Trilkovsky) needs an apartment and enthusiastically calls himself to an apartment when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists and turns begin. Are neighbors trying to kill him? Why show the clothes of the deceased tenant in the apartment? One wonders, finally, if Trelkovksy _is_ is the former tenant. <br /> <br /> One of Bolansky's tricks to us is lying to us. We assume when we see things from a personal point of view that we see things as personal do and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume when our camera shows things from its macro point of view that we really see - but Polanski has a camera located on us.
