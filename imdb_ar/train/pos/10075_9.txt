"Masks" is a moving movie that works on many levels. In its simplest form, it is the painful story of the street artist who is associated with a young child as he tries to pass his creative art to the next generation. Although at times the story turned into the old man in a job, but well designed (written, represented, directed, and superb production values), it is easy to overcome his ordeal. If suspended, the film will eventually be very sweet and spectator. Glory everywhere. This movie is great for kids as well as adults. The trick is how to make Americans who may not love foreign language movies to see it!
