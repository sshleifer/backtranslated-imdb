Let me first mention that although I watched each episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in their parents' basement and attend fashion wear conferences with pointed rubber ears. This film was given seven casting by the historical historical errors. The acting was better than the average, but the plot did not carry surprises. They tried hard to reverse engineering technology but special effects were just a big temptation. Now, with regard to historical mistakes, if you contact them, the first commander of a pilot company in the organization is the commander in April, then Captain Paek, Jim Kirk, etc. They taught them and gave them technology (that's why they created an initial directive) but as I said this is not a reason to discredit this wonderful chain. I hope the pieces become more deep, and then can take special effects back seat.
