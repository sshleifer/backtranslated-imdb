I've seen this movie at least 4 times since 84 and it's still wonderful every time I see it. It is a very attractive version of the Carmen Opera, with stunning flamenco dancing, bare sets, and of course great music. <br /> <br /> Carmen's story is a story within a story, each parallel to some, until the tragic end is multiplied. It is clear that the film was a production of low budget Spain, and contains a dance from some of the main dancers in Spain. The combination of the bustling opera music and the sound of dancers on the wooden stage makes the narrative more powerful. <br /> <br /> It is an independent film industry at best, and may be my favorite all the time foreign film.
