"All Dogs Go to Heaven" is the best animated film depicting dogs in 1989. The former film Don Plath The Land Before Time (1988) became a success. Dogs are very cute like small mice. Oops, I just want to hug them when they're cute. where have you been? Yes sure. The animation is beautiful, and the characters are wonderful when their voice is good and the songs are attractive and touching. It was opened on November 17, 1989, the same date as the production of a small mermaid produced by Walt Disney Animation. <br /> <br /> The part Charlie was killed by Carves was unforgettable. Carface meant that because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame it! The song "Love Survive" performed by Irene Kara and Freddie Jackson is very beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film ever.
