There are three friends, and the British army, seeking to quarrel across the Indian Empire. They are deeply loyal to one another. They face the greatest and most deadly challenge when they face a resurgence of a terrible cult and its malignant teacher. Now they must rely on the lowest server in the regiment, water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save dozens of the queen soldiers from a certain massacre. <br /> <br /> Based on the Three Cavalry more than the classic Keppling poem, epic epic adventures - a worthy entry in the Golden Hollywood year of 1939. full of suspense and humor, while keeping the romantic intervals to a minimum, they capture the attention of the viewer And carry them to the end (emotional). <br /> <br /> It is practically impractical to discuss subtle differences in the performance of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Since they all represent two-thirds of one object - inseparable, and of all intentions and purposes, indistinguishable. However, this does not diminish anything of great fun simply by watching it and enjoying a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note, in parentheses, that McLaglen boasted a prominent military career in World War I; Fairbanks had a remarkable record in World War II - mostly in secret affairs and earning at least 4 The honorary knights after the conflict; Grant was reported to have been a secret agent of the British intelligence and a Nazi sympathizer.) <br /> <br /> The real accolades of Sam Jaffe should be tragic. The humble man was inculcated with brilliant dignity and tremendous courage, making the last line of Kepling's poem ring true. It is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is hugely strong as the Fuji pioneer, while Eduardo Sianelli is Evil Incarnate as a Thuggee teacher. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Koot, Lumsden Hare, are active but do not have much to do. The film tycoons will recognize Cecil Killaway as Miss Fontaine's little father. <br /> <br /> The villain chooses the movie well. The cult of Satanic Thuggee, the bloodthirsty bloody slave of Cali, the goddess of Hindu destruction, was the curse of Indian life for 6 centuries, where asphyxiation was suffocated up to 30,000 victims per year. In 1840, the British army, in cooperation with a number of princely states, successfully suppressed religion. From now on, novels and nightmares will remain.
