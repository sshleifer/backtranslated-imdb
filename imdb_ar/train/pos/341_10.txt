I really enjoyed this excitement! I wanted to see it again once it was finished. The cast was excellent, the plot was exciting and fun, and it was just a fun movie in general! I would like to rate this as one of the best stories I have ever seen! The girls were very nice too, especially Dennis Richards. She was very ornate throughout the film and gave her character some OOMPH!
