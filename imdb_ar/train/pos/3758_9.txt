This movie is awesome. If you take it seriously, of course you will hate it; however, it is a quantity of "men" and "right people" that brings laughter and weak memories about 15 years ago. (1989) If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and mature humor, you do not see them; however, if you You want a fun and funny film, but it's smart and attractive, you'll enjoy it. In fact I wish more of the kind of pictures that have appeared in theaters today. Hey, it's Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone laughs like they act ... true ... you do not get much better than that :)
