This anime is a must see for fans of Evangelion. It is a former work of Anu Heidiki, but his unrestrained drama is entirely present. Also, those who did not like Evangelion may find this version a little more acceptable. Gunbuster is quite unique to anime sci-fi because it actually depends on real science. In fact, the presentation contains several "little science lessons" explaining the physics behind some of the events in the film. One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time quickly close to the light. This series is a great job in dealing with the painful experience of leaving the earth on a six-month mission that is moving near the speed of light and returning to Earth that has been going on for ten years. The main character remains at the age of 17 or 18 years in the entire chain, while almost all other characters are advancing in age. Be careful, this offer is heavy on the sap at times. It also contains two more breast clips that you have never seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore tight uniforms and boo-ho scenes, because the series is very good, but low-tolerance viewers may want to get away from it. In an interesting note, Gainax was able, as always, to run out of money in recent episodes. However, they have been able to use black and white films and are still painting technical drawings to produce a good decision anyway. The end is a little silly, but it left me feeling good in my gut and could not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the coolest anime pieces around.
