This film is one of the most appreciated films of his time. When you watch this movie, it is full of motion, and when nothing real happens, the humor is not identical. A wonderful script for a film that was produced to give us a bloody mix, from a game show where criminals are contestants, and a near future where the public will have a thirst for blood. Arnold does not let us down with some of his best vessels. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his book "I'll be back again," gets the best response for all of them in this film. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.
