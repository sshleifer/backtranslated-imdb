It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "Amati Girls" is such a movie. In the old cinemas, I'd stay ready for more shows. Was this biography of the director / director? It includes the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All team stars present their characters reasonably and tenderly. Who among us does not want Mercedes Rohl as a bigger sister? I loved her work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> In most films, one attaches a belief because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, and so on. Comment this belief in "Amati Girls". One feels like this part of this family! How I wanted to defend Dolores when her family choked her emotional life. He wanted to cheer Lee Grant for criticizing the color of Clore Lichman's poetry. Humor all over is not a humor that laughs belly, but instead has a good quality feeling that satisfies much more than pratfalls and so on. <br /> <br /> The love that is filmed in this cinematic family is to be imitated and cherished. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the family name, Amati, translated from Italian means "loved ones".
