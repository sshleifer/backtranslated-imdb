I think this film is very beautiful. I am not only referring to a breathtaking scene. It is about two unhappy English girls who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their unhappy home life. In the end, four women rent the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons for being there. In this magical beautiful place, they all find the peace they yearn for. It is interesting that peace comes from internal ideas and decisions, more than without it. I also find it fascinating because of the relationships developed from kindness and understanding. Representation is a joy to watch in itself. I especially like the characters of Lotte (Josie Lawrence) and Ms. Caroline (Polly Walker).
