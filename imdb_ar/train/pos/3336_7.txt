I must admit I went to Fever Pitch with low expectations. It is not a big surprise to me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last film (taxi) was so bad, and Fever Pitch's trailer was fine but did not surprise me. I've already prepared some amazing baseball translations for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I love Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was one of his career ... Well, now we have steeeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! Another strike, back to SNL!" Or "Buy yourself some peanuts and crackers, but do not buy tickets to Fever Pitch. Then, the film had to go and be more entertaining than I expected. But hey, I could not let the puny get lost, right? Another reason I thought I would not care about the film is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. My family all hate. Just mentioning the name Pedro Martinez sends me to the bathroom. Hey man, stuck ... <br /> <br /> Well, I've come back. In any case, my mother, a fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the world championship was rigged last year. She refuses to believe that Sox won it legitimately. But I'm a man enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize, albeit slightly, with Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sport will be able to link to this movie at some levels. Unless you have a favorite sports team you can not fully understand the high ups and downs that fans like Fallon Ben can pass. There is nothing quite new like the smell of a new season and nothing quite smooth as a clean menu. Well, metaphorically speaking. It's a joy to be a sports fan. "Wait until next year", your logo and logo becomes your link - Fever Pitch captures this essence effectively. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that the film takes a fictional story and sets it against a realistic background from the unlikely global Red Sox series launched last year. I do not like her so much that I want to marry her, but you know what I mean. I expected that this would be handled in a fairly cheesy way, and although some humor is a little silly, it is actually rather realistic. <br /> <br /> As you can see, Ben took his uncle to his first match with Red Sox when he was 7 years old, and when he died Ben left my card of the season. Ben did not miss the game 23 years ago. At the beginning of each season, he has a draw day where he and his friends meet to see who will go to any games with him. It makes everybody dance on the Yankees and whenever someone complains of his threat to play games with the royal family (sorry Mr. Shide) and Devil Rays. It's a very good scene, and it works well because I actually know the people who are doing Ticket Day. I must also admit that I can call when Ben goes for dinner with Lindsay and her parents. Red Sox plays a road game, but instead of watching it directly on television, Ben decides to record it online. One of the most dangerous things in life is recording a game then entering the public and trying to avoid hearing the result. I was there. It is a very tense and frightening position. Weeeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a man appears in the restaurant and recalls watching the game. His son covers his ears immediately and begins to scream like a doom so as not to hear the result. Lindsay is embarrassing, and her parents do not know what they are thinking. Yes, sports fans can be weird, and I do not deny it. But this is true. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect raw things, which were known to the Farrelly brothers, you could be disappointed. They have their moments, such as when he says he likes the way Lindsay occasionally talks about the other side of his mouth "like a wonderful brain victim," but overall this is a soft, romantic side of Bruce. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the movie has become happier than ever before. Fortunately, when the sap begins to evaporate a little, the freilones know when to withdraw. A romantic moment with Lindsay jumps on the pitch and runs to Ben to announce that her relentless love turns into a loyal Ben's response, "Do you have to tell me about the outside court. Jimmy Fallon proves that using the right material he can handle well on the big screen, Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy magic. Fever Pitch is just a good and solid entertainment that takes a fairly new look at the romantic comedy genre. It is a film that can be associated with men and girls. Especially men who exercise sports intolerance sometime during the year and ladies who must deal with em. <br /> <br /> Now if it is possible for Red Sox fans please silence about the "Bambino curse" I will appreciate it. Memphis Tigers did not win the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially announced my biggest defeat. <br /> <br /> The GIST fans fanaticism in general should consider giving a stadium fever look. I will not go out of my way to rush and see it in the first available time, but it will lead to a great situation. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
