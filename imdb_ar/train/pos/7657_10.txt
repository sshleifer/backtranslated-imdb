This is a very bleak film, hard to beat, so it is brutal about the condemned death break. Black and white photography prevents him from dating. Mickey Rooney is as excellent as a twisted lead, but strangely sympathetic. One of the first films to depict the psychological ruin of the death penalty. It is also very impressive.
