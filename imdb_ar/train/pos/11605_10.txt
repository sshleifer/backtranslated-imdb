The biggest reason I had to see this movie is that it represents the star Susan Swift, a prominent and very unexpected actress. I do not care about time travel movies and I do not care about movies about magic, but this film was wonderful and creepy. Did not rely on the special effects outrageous and did not focus heavily on travel over time until the viewer is lost and confused. This was a really simple and focused film about great acting by everyone.
