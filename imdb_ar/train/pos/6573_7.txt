The film feels a lot of play from the start - I think it will make a better show of the film because the set and drama make the film version seem somewhat artificial. However, it is still fairly well executed, and the story is particularly interesting dialogue. They took the dialogue just like the actual play. It may be a good introduction to the Shaw play. <br /> <br /> Main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a dramatic taste, and representative Helena Bonham Carter is doing a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is somewhat caricature when he assumes he is a very likable character. Her parents are entertaining enough.
