I saw the film in Vienna a few years ago, where the audience was impressed. I also liked the performance of Summer Phoenix still chasing me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in London around 1900, when a Jewish girl decided to become an actress. She tries to become one, but not before the man treats her badly that she realizes on stage that she has a talent and that she communicates with the audience and stands out as a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews, smashed her performance, accused her of being boring, and unable to bring life back to her personality. I think this is her strong point of view, which is exactly what Esther should have been and Phoenix has made a brave decision to make Esther a pretty boring girl. So their transformation in the end is stronger than it could have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> The film industry is fantastic, and the pictures of London around the end of the century are very dark and sad, and you can see how unpleasant life was at that time. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in my opinion is the length of the movie, you lose contact with the characters, after all just about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no exciting actions in the movie. It is credited to Phoenix that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
