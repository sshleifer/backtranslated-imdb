NR rating (R will be classified for the widespread language and crude sexual humor). Qu√©bec: 16+ (must be over 13) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delerious is the first Eddie comedy routine. The film appeared in 1983. He then appeared in the film's 48 hours and commercial venues and was on Saturday Night Live. Eddie made two comedies standing. Delius and Rao. I preferred Ru because I only found the subject more humorous. But Delerious is also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood film and enjoying celebrities such as Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson.Any fan of comedy comedy should watch Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
