Was there a more magical film than this? One of the reasons why everything works well is that the cast really interacts and has an impact on each other's lives. Its center is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan, who work together and can not come face to face but communicate anonymously with each other as pen colleagues. But there are also supportive characters and unlike many romantic comedy films (including "You Got Got Mail," the latest update to "Shop"), they are not only hidden to support the prospects and their needs. Everyone must be a complicated part of the rich fabric of Ernst Lubitch's magic. One of the most depressing scenes in the history of the film occurs when Frank Morgan accidentally quizzes and humbles someone for Christmas dinner. Must see! **** Away from home ****
