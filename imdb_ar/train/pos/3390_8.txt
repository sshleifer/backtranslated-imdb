Time is the future and for many who are unaware of that day is now. In this latest film of the legendary actor, Robinson, Solent Green became a classic. Many orange film and environmentalists believe that this is our final history. The film is taken from the novel "Making room, or making room", but it is the title of the work that has been changed to "Solent Green". The story relates to the Earth as it evolves into the future as environmental problems in the world become less catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been depleted and basic food has been diverted to simple basic materials. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now "Solent Green". However, there is someone who knows the "real" element in Solent Green and swings at his own responsibility and fears divine punishment. The first is an executive director of food named William R. Simpson (Joseph Coton). When he dies, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorne (Charleston Heston) looks for the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption has reached the top, it begins with Simonsons personal guard, Ted Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security Chief Donovan (Roy Jenson) who target Thorne for a waste disposal plant. Thorn's chief, Lieutenant Hatter (Brook Peters), suspects his suspicions but warns him of those "high and hot" people who want to close the case, but Thorne will not risk his "job" for an easy exit. Thorn's discovery represents his death, but like the film, he waits for a final warning. ****
