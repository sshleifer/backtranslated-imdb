Great idea: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 managers from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talks about an ordinary (as usual) immigrant (as usual). The French do a very good job, while the Burkina Faso film was a nice surprise. However, the Israeli film was somewhat boring, and the Mexican guy, well, must give up directing and working in a Mexican restaurant. 10/08
