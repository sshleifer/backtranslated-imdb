"The Last Hard Man" is a typical western of the 1970s. Most seem to be inspired by Sam Beckenba. This is also, but director Andrew McLaughlan is John Ford's pupil, and can clearly appear in many scenes. IMO is a very good start. Somehow McLaglan wanted to show the public a journey from civilization to the wilderness. In the third part, there are some illogical flaws and a little complaining of Charleston and Houston. He has to play the role of a former lawman named Sam Borgid but in great physical condition. I never felt that he was having problems climbing on a horse or on a rock. To me he did not seem very enthusiastic as he usually does in most of his epic films. The same is true of beautiful Barbara Hershey who plays the role of Sheriff's daughter. Both may have had trouble with the director or were unhappy with his roles. Hershey and Cobren have not done their best, but they are still good. If the screenwriter John Wayne is in their minds Sam Bourged? Michael Parkes is also a modern, low-cost police chief. On the other hand, there is James Coburn outlaw Zach Provo. Coburn is a really great villain in this one. It depicts the bad man between the hatred of mania and intelligence. His role and representation is the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are wonderful. The scenes of bloody shooting and violence seem realistic. Zac Provo and his gang had some violent and violent scenes. What I miss is typical Western work in the middle of the film. I would appreciate stealing a bank or something similar. Overall it's an amusing Western flick. Not a great movie but above average because Coburn is gorgeous and a very good start and some violent and violent scenes.
