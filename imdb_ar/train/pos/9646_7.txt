There is certainly a passion between the two main individuals when exploring their relationship - one relies primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. There is also an emotion in the internal workings of the Mathieu family that deals with his mother's problems - and how this affects their relationship. But the problem is that they leave a lot of things unanswered (unless you're too stupid to take it). Why Matthew in a mental hospital? What led to the disintegration of the children? The backlash between the present and the past is difficult to follow a little at first. It seems that the main reason for renting this movie is to enjoy some homosexuality, or some male condom. But as a love story or a personal study it is unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory.
