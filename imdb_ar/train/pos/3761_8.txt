Bill and Ted's false trip is a sequel to Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. I followed them on a false journey almost immediately after the first film, and it does a good job if not better to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is a wicked person from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that look just like Bill and Ted. As soon as robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the gloomy frenzy (death) and bring their lives back to normal. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is top notch, and so they thought it was a little weird at times, especially the Bill and Ted talks, it's a great movie. It is certain that the Tamkeen rockers made another great film. Choose this command your next time in the blockbuster!
