The spoilers This is a movie that revolves around grifters. But who fools from here? When does a hunter turn into prey? This dark dark film is slow moving and tempting. It pulls you down and walks down the path of the homeopathic garden, just to distract you just as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> It contains garbled text, with good representation (at least from the leads). I did not notice background music, but it was never tense, so it should be done correctly. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised because I loved this movie, because I usually do not go to this genre but this one sucked me and kept hooked up to the end.
