Too slow, but very intricately structured and ultimately influential. A very beautiful and true look at a small beach town in Florida at the end of winter - I've been there and this is absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It is also the first feature of the actress. Ashley Judd, she gives a great impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in the theaters, and I recently hired "Ruby" again. With the exception of the 80s, she has stood up very well. Ashley is very glamorous and touching here, so it's hard to think of her next career without winning. Boy, talk about failure to meet your promise early! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby in Paradise" assumes that this elegant natural beauty belongs to all kinds of dramatic and serious artistic films - instead the girl has become a "go-to" for stupid motion movies and hideous movies! Very disappointing, but at least, this beautiful performance has been preserved to display its early promise. <br /> <br /> As some other commentators say, this is not for everyone because it is too slow. This is not a movie movement, nor is it really a love story. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent personal study) treats this young girl's life with deep respect, allowing her story to build slowly and in more detail. In this way, I think this is one of the most interesting and respectful stories of adulthood about the young women I can remember - not about Ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity, but about her life choices. And its growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A nice movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really wonderful film to show teenagers and young girls (or boys in this regard) and give them a chance to think about it and discuss it. <br /> <br /> A special tribute to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, is so realistic and detailed that I assumed it was through the film. In a novel or diary written by a female, but in fact this is the original work of Mr. Nunez. Rating 8 out of 10.
