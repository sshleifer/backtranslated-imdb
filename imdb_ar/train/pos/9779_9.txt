Three horror stories based on members of a hostile Hindu cult returning to their homes but changed in some way. In the first story, our former members of the community are now in a madhouse and are visited by a reporter who wants to know what happened in the community. A bit slow as the story is listed in the memories of the past while the two sit on chairs and face each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of participants. What seemed boring suddenly turns into excitement with a sudden twist in the story. Things get absolutely bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story contains a violent young criminal who visits a psychiatrist for compulsory treatment. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda but the psychiatrist is about to do the job. Again, things slow down a bit and become strange. Then there is a strange twist in the story written and surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> The final story deals with a spiritual therapist who claims to be able to remove the illness of the people in their hands. One patient is a former member of worship, so successful healing becomes more complex. Again, we are amazed by the evolution. He has a rather bitter scene there. <br /> <br /> There is some nice feminine nudity for females as well as full male nudity for some reason. I have found that the stories are well written and the director manages perfectly to prepare each story with its surprising development and beyond. <br /> <br /> NOTE: Review the German DVD.
