With Tony badly injured in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines himself living the life of a salesman attending a trade conference, while his family and friends are in hell trying to overcome the potential loss of the big man. Dream sequences are found just outside the old TWILIGHT ZONE ring, where Tony finds himself transformed into an "average atmosphere" trying to deal with a lost wallet and mixed identities during a cross-country business trip. His sophistication as a Shinuk maker wearing a jacket and khaki is more than the middle of America and less than an Italian nugget from Noi Gozzi. Nice touch. AJ, a long-haired, long-haired AJ (nicknamed "Van Helsing" at some point), has a wonderful scene with his sleepy old man. The best moments in which adult boys try to talk about life without Tony, which immediately collapses into a regional conflict. Vito swings about the dead new gene, and it may have been a closet issue, which is interesting in light of what we are learning about Vito.
