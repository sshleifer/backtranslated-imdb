The heroine is really adorable, surprised and terrified, at the corner, with precious stones, wrestling with the mattresses, and turning into closed doors ... Only a few moments shine in my memory of "bare truth". I liked what you discovered in this show: Pleased intrigues and some good supporting characters were presented for the diamond from the show - Tea Leoni, "Nora Wilde"; a nice clown, and a terrific exhibit of the incident - how refreshing it is to see an actress who can clown - no wonder Hollywood He does not seem to know how to cast it. But where - where - DVD versions? The amount of bleep they are giving, it is incredible to me that these small gems are still buried. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
