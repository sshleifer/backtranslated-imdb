Other reviewers have summed up this Noir film well. I just wanted to add to "oh wonder!" A comment made by one of the reviewers regarding the drum ring operated by Coca-Cola is clearly a coca. This was Douzy, I must say. Cook deserved some praise for his frenzied performance. <br /> <br /> Some of the trivia that surprised her: Cook appeared as a barber in the 1941 film Barbara Stanwyck, "The Ball of Fire". He was a waitress in a nightclub where Barbara sang, and the legendary drummer Jane Krupa knocks the drums more forcefully. Is there much to suggest that the Cook cook fresh in a later film, Phantom Lady, was very inspired by the work of Krupa, as Cook experienced three years ago? <br /> <br /> If you see Krupa in "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice some similar body movements clearly. One hopes, of course, that happiness will not be affected by any drugs at that time!
