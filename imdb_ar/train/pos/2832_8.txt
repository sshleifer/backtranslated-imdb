I saw this movie in 1969 when it premiered at the Cameo Theater on the South Beach, and is now the famous Night Crowbar Club. It was the last year of the sixties of the last century, and this film really came home. She got it all. The generation gap, the sexual revolution, the pursuit of success, and the conflict between following the "traditions" of one family and those of the pursuit of private life. <br /> <br /> It was a very fast and very moving film. Vegas was at its most fragile peak, and Sin City was in all its glory. Beautiful woman, famous veil, laughing, conflict, romance, even happy ending. A very enjoyable time for everyone. <br /> <br /> The poster from this movie is on the wall of my bedroom. I look at her and come back in time; the time of my youth and my times with my father, a wonderful time in my life.
