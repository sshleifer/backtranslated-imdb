It took some time to see this release because unfortunately, I do not seem able to rent it in the video store, just the other version, but I liked it. I always border with other Emma. Gwyneth and Tony Collett, since they are not Britons, must put the dialect naturally, and it does not seem normal to me. It seems to have been put on. Sorry but do not think that Tony and Gwyneth did a wonderful job there. I could not warm any of the characters, but this version is more comforting and more of the kind of person I imagined to be Emma. It is certainly the version I will return to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley was not the best performer, but he was convincing. I love Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I was never enthusiastic about it, but it was filmed better in this version. Come to think of it, (along with Mr. Knightley) all the characters played better, much less than the top. Unfortunately, both came out almost simultaneously and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Compassion ... ... I also love the new scene in the end. Well done to Kate Pickingsell! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this.
