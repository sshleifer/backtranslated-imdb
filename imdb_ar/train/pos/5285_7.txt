You think you are in some serious sights when the film is primarily imposed between two characters as it travels 3,000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, passing through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before reaching the East Middle. But this is not a tour, and there are no stops to soak in sights. <br /> <br /> Reza's father is in his second year and wants to do Hajj. However, because walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can not drive the car, thus using Rida's help, to protest his son, to get him there in his broken car. <br /> <br /> But Reza does not see the goal of making him go his way. When his father can choose the plane. He hated the idea of ​​putting his personal life on hold because of this pilgrimage he could not understand. Thus, we embarked on this arduous journey with father and son, being no better than friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to witness the evolution of the father and son's husband, the challenges faced by the face, the strange people you meet, the need to dispose of them in various weather conditions, and the intermittent rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see a clear gap between the generations trying to communicate with each other, the father tries to impose it on his son, and the son tries to assert himself as an adult, but the conditions we see reveal that the satisfaction of a fish out of the water. . Through many meetings, they cooperate well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It may be appropriate to publish this film here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and to allow our heroes to join other pilgrims in the Hajj. The final scene in Mecca is a real scene, and you will also feel the phobia of fear and fear as Reda tries to find his father among the thousands of people who gather. Europe's sights may not have been taken care of in order to build anticipation and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> She certainly has the idea of ​​telling friends about how much you value them. Do not miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house.
