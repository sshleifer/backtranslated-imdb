A stunning performance by Simon Pegg who became better and better with every turn. As usual, it plays a very cumbersome role that makes you want to hide behind your pillow and sometimes embarrass him, but that's what Pegg is about. <br /> <br /> The laughs were regular and eye-splitting, and everyone was aiming at Ben. The film was cleverly crafted, with each character playing a very sophisticated and dangerous role. Penn was the only relevant humor that was a great tribute to Robert Widdy. <br /> <br /> I can not let this go without a quick round of applause for Gilliam Anderson who shone all the time. Highly recommended for everyone.
