I am a big fan of the film, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Wenger performed at higher than average rates, and I think the groups were the site and the era, and I loved the track and the Charlie Daniels band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the inner scenes were filmed at the actual club and the roof of my body was low - maybe 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to mimic the "bar filled with smoke" hung 2-4 feet under the ceiling. The camera was able to get shots of smoke and focus on actors, bull, bar, women, dancing, the dim lighting level that was already in the tape! What a feat! Sure there is additional lighting, but in order to maintain the bar atmosphere, the shots must be low-light. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was great! He got some footage he had no hope of achieving and the effect of its impact on reality. Thanks, Ray - great work!
