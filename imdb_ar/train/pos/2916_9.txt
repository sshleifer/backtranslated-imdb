Of all the films I have seen, most of them films, this is the best film that has been produced and is primarily related to the US Navy (Blimps) during World War II. Yes, there are other movies related to LTA, but most of them use more special effects than any real-time footage. This marine man contains more realistic real-time shots of blimps and so on. True, a lot of rhetorical dialogue, but that's what makes Hollywood movies more interesting, even today. Note I spent 10 years (out of 20) and I have more than 5000 hours in naval exercises of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. A proud member of the Marine Exercise Society etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
