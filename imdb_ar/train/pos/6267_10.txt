I thought the origin of this film was attractive and charming and made me sit on the edge of the seat I was trying to discover. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the original already, when I saw this on Sci Fi - I do not know if this new version was intentionally made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was during the first few minutes. Because I love Richard Burgy as a representative of characters, I wanted to see how he would pull him. <br /> <br /> Authors / producers, etc., have updated the film a little by trying to explain the plight of "aliens." "(They can no longer reproduce their type and need help) using the same pseudo-flag that was packed in our ears in the nineties, maybe adding a little polish to the film, or not. <br /> <br /> This film. Production on the brink is more sinister than the original - the original ended with a confrontation between the young and the foreign and the understanding of the species, although there is no solution to the alien problem. <br /> <br /> I remember that in this new version, the woman became hostile to the Borgi / I think it could have ended better, but the end is just the end, and the yarn is a puffy yarn, being from a pile of pigtails For the basic science of 1958. Many great science fiction stories were written in the 1950s, some even photographed them. <br /> <br /> This is something puffy that can be seen like a rainy day or something. Of the old 50 reverts in science fiction, this one came out well.I really enjoyed this to some extent. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wanted to see this story told by WELL, I suggest the original 1958 release with Tom Tyrone And Gloria Talbot, directed by Jane Fowler Jr.
