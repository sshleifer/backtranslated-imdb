It is rare to sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a certain program. It's even rarer when I finally enjoy the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I've seen. <br /> <br /> A wonderful actor, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, has an excellent, witty and influential text combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can not really express my belief that it was good, so I will not try, I will just say, if you had the opportunity, please see it !!!! I just hope to come out on the video.
