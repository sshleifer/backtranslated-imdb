It's a live video, so he has to go without saying he will not compete with the first Lion King, but that was quite good, though. <br /> <br /> My children love this, but this is given, they love anything that represents animation. It was a big shock that * I also liked it, she was laughing out loud in some parts (even fart jokes), and had lots of creative links with the first movie, and even some jokes you had to be older to understand (but not being as if you were Shrek ["Do you think it makes up for something?"]). <br /> <br /> A special note on fart jokes, I was surprised when I found that none of the jokes were just toilet sounds (in fact there were no noises / photos at all, the reviews were actually fairly accurate), and they had Already set up / punchlin / etc, and they were in almost good taste. I would like my kids to think that there is more humor than going to the bathroom, and this film is good in these respects. <br /> <br /> Is this something else? The music was fantastic, it was not nearly as in the first or second film, but it was full of fun for the kids. No painful moments, which were a blessing for me. A little work but nothing too scary (I gave NIMH mystery nightmares to my kids, I'm not sure that the G rating was appropriate for that ...) <br /> <br /> In general, I say this is a wonderful film for children of any age, It's 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be too sensitive but I had to stand and turn off the TV in a few less child-friendly movies than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this. I would say stick around anyway, you might find you enjoy it too :)
