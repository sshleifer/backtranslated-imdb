This is a tongue in the cheek film from the beginning with a loud voice that enjoys everything French and then produces a naïve but very brave hero in Vafnane, not Tulip. The beautiful young man Gerrard Philippe is depicted, the young man fully believes in the lighted fate of Luprgida - especially as he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that Lulu soon found out that she was in love with Fanfan. <br /> <br /> With good sword battles, cavalry castles, and other spirited action sequences, the movie moves fast and with lots of comics. Moments. Maybe the trend is the weakest, but the film is too light and takes itself so seriously that I can not give an idea of ​​these shortcomings. Look for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavyweight in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making him a nuisance, feeding the text to a fortune teller reading La Lollo's hand! The Jewel of Marcel Herand as King Louis XV paranoia and lust-driven! That's not all: A lot of beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and in 1952! The film may have been released that year, but his brilliant, crisp, brilliant novel, pure photography and the unforgettable image of Gerard Philippe ensure his stay is fresh and fun to watch. I will not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone anyone who loves movies in general and scammers in particular! do you see it!
