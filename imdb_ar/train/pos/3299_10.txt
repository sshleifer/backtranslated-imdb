A wonderful film requires an acquired taste. If you work, hit the Bam movies and hate serious love stories, this is not for you. Otherwise, if you want to sit in front of a good smart movie every now and then I highly recommend this. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Hindi film I will present 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge until then comes second to this masterpiece.
