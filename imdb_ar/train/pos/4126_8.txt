What a night. Perry Mason, Then Gun, Will Travel, followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour), and finally at 10:30 pm, "Sea Hunt" with its brilliant opening music and Mike's boat came to a new adventure. Awesome .. Regardless of the story, she was a leading figure (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest and sincere. Man man and boy man. This interest brought in boats that lasted for years. Why not show up on the cable or make it available on video, no idea .. very bad.
