At first I did not like this much, although I did. They did not include Generation Trueba III, and the love between Blanca and Pedro did not explain well and some of the actors were very different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that if the film were to be more loyal to the book, it would be five hours long and would be somewhat boring. I love her so much now, because my favorite characters are there as she was. Clara looks like a direct angel, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film is fascinating, sincere and short. Glenn Clos is Ferrola. I've portrayed it just like this, but not only in mourning in everything. Esteban finds enough. I never liked him, and although I was interested in him, he hated him a lot, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the latter part is the most exciting part, and has a real history also there. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, keeping in mind that it was a Greengo film based on an American Latin book. It's amazing how many stars are famous, do not you think so?
