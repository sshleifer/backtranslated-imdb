This is a fantastic series first of all. It was done very well and very interesting. As the Second World War buff is huge, I learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things that this happens is all the interviews with former individuals when the war was relatively new in their minds, that is relatively speaking. There is nothing against the men you see interviewing in today's programs, and most of these men did not actually take part in the higher levels of what was happening at the time. One of the best parts is Sir Lawrence Oliver's narrative. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know about World War II, but I really think that only the hardliners (like me) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some facts are not exactly as accurate as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union exaggerated or just inaccurate in places. This information is different now and we now know because of the fall of the Soviet Union. Overall a fascinating look at World War II must see any serious or personal World War II historian.
