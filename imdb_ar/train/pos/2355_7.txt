... but I enjoyed the show anyway. I have read some of the comments that previous reviewers had to say about this show, and I have a hard time voiding all criticisms in my head (except one: that the offer was not valid; this program was nothing but meaningless). Many of the things that people raise about this show are money: buzz; coercive; overbearing; desperate to complacent self satisfied; annoying narration ever. But did you know? I really loved it. It was different, it was original, it was really wonderful; it consisted of all the negatives. The show was bright, verbal, quick, smart, fun, fun to look at ... you know, it was only once a week, and I can bring it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. We will mourn his death. But I think no one will bring this back to life.
