This movie is very good! Despite Carmen Electra, this must be one of the best films I've ever seen. Jimmy Kennedy is very amazing, and Lauren Dean plays the role of a well-spoiled movie star. The plot is great as well. Everything is very real which is scary. She says it's a drama, but she's one of the most dramatic dramas I have ever seen. Go check it out.
