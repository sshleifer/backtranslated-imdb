Many of the reviews here explain the story and characters of "Opening Night" in some detail so I will not do so. I just want to add my comment which I think the film is a wonderful confirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At first, Myrtle Gordon remembers how easy it was when she was 17 and young and energetic and felt she knew the truth. The experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was and if she could continue to live. The tragic event leads to a nearly personal crisis. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At 11 o'clock she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself ("I will bury that villain," she says of her fellow actor Maurice as she moves on stage). Seems almost sadistic when the manager of Myrtle prevents people from helping her when she gets into a desperate drunk for her first performance. However, he knows that she must have the courage to make herself if she wants to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder whether this victory is only a temporary stop on the downhill route of Myrtle. I think this is really the "opening night" - it opens up as a flower of new possibilities for life and work, and it sees a way forward. It's moving a lot. <br /> <br /> Jenna Rowlands is wonderful. The movie is awesome. Thank you Mr. Cassavet wherever you are.
