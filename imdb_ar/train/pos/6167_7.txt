"Such a long journey" is a well-prepared film, a good shot, and a presentation of some good performances. However, the story is a combination of sub plots and alien characters that have turned into a kind of jack for all conspiracies and master none. Also, Western viewers may find the mysteries of the slightly ambiguous Bar√ßi culture to get their arms in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those who have an interest in India.
