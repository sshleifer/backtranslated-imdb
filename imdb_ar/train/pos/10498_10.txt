It's a bit easy. That's about it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some fences are two-dimensional, but can be tolerated. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. Sounds great. Everything from talking to SFX is fun and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it is the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in In 1997, and since then, has received 120 stars more than 10 times.
