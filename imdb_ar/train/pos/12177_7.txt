Synopsis: The next morning, Paul woke up at the hands of his mother-in-law and discovered that there was a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, the waitress from the bar, not his fiancee. And suddenly appeared everywhere ... the phone booth on the highway and at the parents' dinner. It is hard to keep a secret when her ex-jealous boyfriend follows him and photographs him. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: actually much better than expected. It's not the sweet romantic comedy that I expected, it's something funnier, a little edge. This movie was not afraid to take jokes a little more. Jason Lee now has a way of presenting comedy, especially when his character is frightened and conflicted, as he is here. He received beautiful support from the beautiful ladies Julia Steeles and Selma Blair. In fact I thought that Luclin Monroe had a nice role like the former. <br /> <br /> So, the focus on comedy was more than romantic, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> 7/10
