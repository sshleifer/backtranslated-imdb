This kind of film about young teenagers struggling for their sexuality was something unique, bold and daring a few years ago, but more and more movies have been produced over the past few years, making it difficult for films to remain truly prominent. <br /> <br /> The film has also received little publicity, apart from the usual small film festivals that have appeared in this small French film, as well as major festivals that are always fascinated by this kind of small film about daily issues that are not dealt with With it often in movies. The film was first shown at Cannes in 2007 and has already won some awards there. <br /> <br /> The film really does not really make a big difference to other movies, because it really shows a little bit new by watching some similar movies like this, but that really does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is bad to watch. The film is certainly a good witness, dealing with its theme well and telling its story firmly, and thus effectively, at a somewhat slow French cinema pace. <br /> <br /> It is an old film, focusing on the lives of basically 3 completely different mid-teens. Sex is a big theme within the film, which is treated with precision and precision. It makes the film and its story in general quite realistic, although somewhat predictable, since the film does not offer anything original enough within this genre. <br /> <br /> This kind of French film may frighten many people because of why they might expect to be very intrusive, with deep layers and meanings. However, "Naissance des pieuvres" is a film available to all, and you do not have to be in European teen films to appreciate this film. It is a kind of gentle and somewhat sensual film, given the theme and the visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistically by its representatives, who have not had and have a lot of experience within cinematography but have authentic appearance and feeling within their roles. The strong individual characters of the film offer some nice features and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie about his subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
