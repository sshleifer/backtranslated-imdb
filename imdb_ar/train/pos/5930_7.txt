The Terrible Terrible Mother (Alice Craig and Bryan Krauss) absorbs the life force of the virgins, and their newest target is Tania (Amic Madchen). However, these monsters are affected by the sensitivity of cat scratches ... I have never been a fan of the most popular and exhilarating books like King or Koontz or Barker, but this film written by Mr. Dung himself, actually is not soon as bad as it could be. Yes, it is sometimes grossly obscene, but in fact there are some amazingly impressive touches: a good old-fashioned graveyard, wonderful soundtrack, a Gothic candlelit house, a mirror showing the brutal shape of the wicked, etc. Of course, the film was polluted by Mr Dung's strong dialogue and mania of every toilet seat to offend obese people, leading to a completely unintelligible sub-plot of the rapist teacher, but there is a heap among the compost.
