Two years later, I realized two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed it a lot, and 2) because its implementation is certainly more clear than the hypothesis itself. I laughed on my way to the film before it happened to me to renew the initial protests - the frosty valleys, their glories and their heads (even good * - beloved air planes) are not only inherently funny, especially when they pull the length of the feature. But while the film's momentum is finally emerging, Reeves, Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show this wonderful sense of comic timing throughout even the most clumsy jokes (like Ted's failure to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) Work effortlessly like that miserable (like challenge). The Winters and Rives team is so well drawn that the Bill and Ted team (who spend only one scene in the entire film, a disaster if not very well matched) seems to be completely unrestrained. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found that the first movie was just intermittently entertaining - there seem to be different comedic sensibilities out there.) <br /> <br /> Give it a 7.75. Amazingly good fun.
