Excellent film, realistic picture of contemporary Finland, impressive and profound. One of the best Finnish movies ever. The wonderful daily life of a small town in central Finland captures the people's desires, weaknesses, joys and sorrows. Early bright sunlight creates a cool atmosphere for this clear examination of people in the welfare community. Lampela is actually one of the leading Finnish filmmakers. Explains that it is possible to produce movies without guns and bloodshed. His next film, Ella, also deserves a vision, although the story of cleaning up women fighting for their jobs is not as attractive around the world as the fate of a jockey.
