"Itch in Time" is one of a series of home games run by Bob Clambeet for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins By A Hare". Soaked in the timing of mania and exaggerated mess, it is essentially an epic flea that is busy breaking the ground for a new home, and the dog whose land is broken. Because Mr. Elmer will give him a scary flea bath if it is like scratches, unfortunate dogs have to endure an escalating spiral of torment because household fleas use picking axes and electric tools to clean the "ground". In the end, the little monster wicks the wick to a small mountain of high explosives that was accumulating on the back of his victim! There is a huge explosion, and the unhappy dog ​​covers his eyes while his rear end explodes in the Fourth of July show! It must be really painful, and the dog is riding on the journey, but he quickly stops moving and says with a cheerful smile, "You guys cut it well," "The reason I think I'm beginning to like it!" For years, The current publications have recaptured the clip, so viewers can now enjoy it in its original satanic glory, yet the retribution is still the ending in which the cat blows its brains after being deplorable. "I've seen it all now!" It has since been cleared of this cartoon and many others, including "Horton".
