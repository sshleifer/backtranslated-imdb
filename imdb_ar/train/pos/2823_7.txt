MGM was not sure how Garbo marketed when she first reached Hollywood. Meyer had a great faith in her and her appearance in the "Torrent" justifies it. She did not speak English, so she had to work hard, and Ricardo Cortez did not make it easy for her. <br /> <br /> The title is the Guscar River, through which a small, sleepy village passes through Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) once hopes that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her parents who struggle. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love but under the thumb of his mother and can not push her to marry. Meanwhile, Donna Brool (Martha Matox) took Leonora's parents from their home and sent Leonora to Paris in the hope of giving her a chance to continue her career. Leonora sends a note to Rafael, urging him to remember his promise and come with her. His mother is angry and prevents him from going - so of course he complies with her request. <br /> <br /> Years have passed. Leonora has a new identity - I have become La Bruna, Paris Opera toast. Rafael has appeared exactly as his mother wanted - he is running for president and flirting with a "safe" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmsted), heir to a "pig". Mac Swain plays her father. Leonora decided to visit her old house, and I agree - why did not her mother help out. Her mother still lives in the family's home, working as a table for honey and washing clothes. Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of irony. Garbo is beautifully beautiful, and it's hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam explodes and floods the city. Leonora's house is on the raging river road, but when Raphael tries to save her she finds it safe. Then rekindle their romantic relationship. There is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, much like the scene in "Flesh and the Devil". <br /> <br /> Donna Brool starts spreading gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora's mother believes in it and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora before touring America. Again he intends to go with her but again let her down. He spends a lot of time listening to other people destroy her reputation - "What will you do for you but your geek down." The irony is that she just got a senior government job for him if he came with her. They meet again, years later - they are as fresh and vibrant as they have always been - seem older than his years, and leanness has bowed them. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a good movie that carries a positive message that follows your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job like Cupido, the barber and the old and faithful Leonora friend. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
