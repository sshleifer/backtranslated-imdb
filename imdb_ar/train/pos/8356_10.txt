I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Just a small but essential thing to watch out for, an interesting possibility: boys steal a CitroÃ«n green car at some point, on an enjoyable trip. , And returned him to the owner after causing deliberate and critical hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner would crash. Is it the same car that they later steal from the family of picnics? We know that the original owner sold it. They finally drive the car on a dangerous road, which I understand has been closed to everyone but pedestrians over the last 10 years. A completely new tendency to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie could have been named "Smell Woman". I do not remember another film, certainly not American, treating the smell of a woman in an open and open manner, like the beautiful "nose" of Bordeaux.
