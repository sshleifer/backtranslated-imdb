Hey guys I'm actually in this movie! I did not know it was on this site so I looked a few years ago and was very surprised! I played House, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I loved every minute. During filming, I needed to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double sex! The finger that presses the radio button in the car is not mine. I'm still acting and doing some TV, but not. Oh, and if you want to prove that my name is the first at the top of the scrolling. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was okay but if I was not there, it would not be my favorite. I thought acting was really good, but the story line was just that.
