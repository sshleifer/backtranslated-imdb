I had read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before watching this film. I am always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming the changing events of life, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters presented gives you a sense of family closeness and how positive it is that each other's lives are affected. I can not talk about the accuracy of specific details in this movie, it's normal to get some creative licenses when organizing a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting film for a story to tell. I felt empathy for the characters and chanted in the end.
