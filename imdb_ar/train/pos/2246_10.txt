A wonderful surprise for Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Mola could be a great way out, after all, I do not care much about his choice of films. But this film was very wonderful and unpredictable at all ... something I always enjoy! I did not have much good journalism and I do not really think it will be published in the US market. We will have to satisfy ourselves with a DVD or VHS if so ... I do not want to say much about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you, but the film revolves around a homeless drunkard who becomes the new Christ just to kick and get some money out of him Lots of sooooooooooooo), before he knew he was steeped in a life that was unreliable.
