There is nothing like total murder. Lieutenant Colombo knows that. Ken Franklin, the other half of the detective story-telling team, does not know that. He kills his partner Jim Ferris who had plans to go solo. Colombo enters the picture and asks all sorts of questions from Mr. Franklin. And one more question. Colombo: Murder by the Book (1971) by young Steven Spielberg days before fame. Stephen Boshko wrote that. Colombo is a wonderful figure with his decrepit counterpart. It is hard to believe that this man can solve any crime. But he can every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can photograph this character. So, do not repeat, please. This part is a very good example of how Colombo works. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays the wife of the victim Joanna Ferris. There is something likable in the scenes between Colombo and Ha. How to make omelets and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. I met a tragic fate when she died after her death as she does here. I've been a fan of Colombo since childhood and still enjoy watching it. There was a break for many years because they did not show the stories of Colombo at all, but it is now back. Ask one more question.
