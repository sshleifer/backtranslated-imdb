I saw this film when I was eight and loved it, but I did not understand it until now when I was watching it again at the age of 13. A cartoon about a criminal dog with a real gold heart "adopts" a young girl to use her talents to talk to animals. Kill the star dogs, Charlie B. Barkin, by his official business partner, Karves, (a demonic by the way). His soul then moves to anywhere else, but to heaven only to find a golden watch is really the time of his life, a charlie, being a traitor but beloved child who steals and brings him back, and brings him back to earth. Once on Earth, Charlie goes towards the quest for revenge from Evil Carface. This is the way the young Ann Marie, the only young orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to cheat on her talent to return to his enemy Carves, is confronted. But in fact, Charlie cares to take care of Ann Marie and his plans are unpopular because he has to decide what to do right after Ann Marie finds out that she was "her favorite friend" Charlie really uses to make money for a new and better dog dog. Now she must save her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this film even at the age of 22 years. The idea and the plot are completely different and original from other animation films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of villain for once. Carface was better than in all dogs going to the Sky sequel. In that picture he looked very doubtful for his evil role.
