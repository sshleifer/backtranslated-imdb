As other reviewers have noted, this is one of Tarzan's best films. Unlike others, I like the beginning of the film because it looks like an accurate depiction of what the publication should be. In addition, the exhibition is necessary to know why Harry wants to return to the forest. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and terrifying stalks ever. This happens when you have to set Harry's Safari to override a tribe of cannibals. The values ​​of pre-censorship production add a lot of realism, honestly portraying the terrible dangers awaiting Europeans entering the forest. The film also provides, although perhaps previously, a detailed description of how indigenous Africans deal with white employers. In addition to Jane's sexy, thousands of elephants, some great groups and two chetas! The classic adventure is not to be missed.
