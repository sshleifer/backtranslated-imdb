Only one season was broadcast here in Australia and I think it was very impressive! love it! All story lines are very good! And have a more realistic look at teen life and family today. However, she maintained the strong family values ​​of adhering to each other and being together for each other. Their problems were real, and you were really pushed to the show. The show revolves mainly around this family called "Days" and their lives. The family was made up of Abby Day (Mama), Jack Dae (Abby), Natalie Day (daughter of sports), Cooper Day (the external son) and Nathan Day (born the genius boy) every day of their lives. From which. I loved Cooper for his insight through the checkout was fantastic. It was by far my favorite character. It ended up with many things that could have been going on, I'm really sad there was not another season. It was a wonderful show I would miss.
