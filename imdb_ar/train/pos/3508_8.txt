Interestingly and incredibly interesting, I found it impossible to get away once I started watching. I'm usually one of the harshest critics, but to me this was a wonderful film, strange because it might seem like I can smell the air and feel the strength of the sites. <br /> <br /> From a cinematography, I thought there was a great use of light and texture. From the orange glow to the summer light to the plastic-covered couch, they all had a distinctly realistic feel for me. <br /> <br /> From the perspective of the characters, I thought that the idea of ​​Victor Vargas is the glue that binds almost the story was completely inspired, each member of the family has a more complete background simply cause a greater intrigue in the main character himself. <br /> <br /> After that, someone knew like a grandmother and was on the receiving end of such a position only, I can say that the situation seemed particularly realistic. The embarrassment, the accent and the cooking and even the comments I made felt very authentic to me. <br /> <br /> I think this film was working for me because I started to watch it without any expectations and found it completely immersed and brought back memories of teen passion, worth watching.
