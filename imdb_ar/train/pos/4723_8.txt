I really enjoyed this little movie. It is a moving film about conflict and sacrifice, especially the bonds of friendship between the different peoples (the child actor who plays Mickey is particularly good). There are a lot of non-personal films that have been filmed around World War II, and even this small story, which has been convincingly reported, is a real break from al-Qaeda and authentic. I will also add that this film is far from boring, too far !! Of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery is spectacular. For anyone who treats his animal as part of the family (I do), you will find this film particularly rewarding. Recommended for movie lovers who are looking for something a bit different.
