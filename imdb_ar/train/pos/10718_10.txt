Spacecam is my favorite film. It's a wonderful story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The acting was fantastic and my wife went to see Lea Thompson in a club years later because of her performance in the film. Unfortunately, the Challenger incident caused the film to be postponed and damaged. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is coming. I have known one of Challenger's astronauts and have been working since my childhood on Carnegie Mellon University campus where my father went to school; I also know a close friend of the late pilot. <br /> <br /> I was last year's technical review for BSA National for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge Badge and I still find Spacecamp a great film that I recommend Scouts for the space-related merit I study. <br /> <br /> I ran to the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering instruction that we had put together when Challenger exploded. I ended up sitting with Willard Rockwell and his engineers "invisible" and they were inspecting things after the incident at the Astrotech shareholders meeting by accident as a result, so I'm much closer to an accident and any resemblance to the film. I was sure I was a good student and finished my studies four years later. Strangely enough, on the recommendation of a Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and then built Endeavor.
