It has been said that Diana Durbin invented adolescence. This first film was one of the best films. The 14-year-old comic, Deanna, gave her beautiful beauty a wonderful voice, like "Miss Fixit" in a family divided by divorce. For a summary of the plot, see the other IMDb entries, but soon Deanna and her older sisters plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from getting married again. Through an excellent support team, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the film managed to capture a great image even in subsequent performances. Among the three songs of Diana, "Il Bacio" is only classical music, but when you sing it in the scene of the police station, the place of the film in history is guaranteed. At least it was this viewer who at the age of fifteen was fond of life with both Diana and classical music. One of the many pleasant touches that occur throughout the three smart daughters is a brief overview of a drunkhead stretching his neck to take a last look at Diana while the police are installing him! One unfortunate consequence of the success of this film was that the subsequent books of the Durbin vehicles were locked up in the theme "Miss Fixit", which soon became obsolete. Diana herself never did. Her position as a representative is more controversial than her appeal, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other film characters, she has replaced "natural" with the historical power she lacked. The trick worked well for 21 feature films.
