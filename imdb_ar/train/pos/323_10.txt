It's really an excellent film with a revolutionary message (in terms of form and content) that should not be missed by any of the fans of the New French Wave or Underground. There are almost no credits open or closed - we have just fallen into the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and it is more interesting to play with our own ideas about advertising and its relationship to reality. True and unreal lines are bypassed in familiar ways with films that discuss documentaries, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing, not to describe reality.
