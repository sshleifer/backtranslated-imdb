Personally, I really loved this film, and it particularly conveyed me. The two main actors give us such wonderful performances, in the end, it is very sad to know what happened to their personalities. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbara Streisand and Chris Christoferson is great, and the song is just as wonderful. <br /> <br /> That's why I was not surprised when I learned that she won 5 Golden Globe Awards (the most rewarding movie in the Golden Globe), an Oscar and even Grammy. This classic movie deserves to be seen by everyone. This film has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to participate in it, certainly "as a co-director"). Her art is the biggest, and this certainly will satisfy you!
