I watched the movie today and blew my mind. It is a real masterpiece and I do not understand why most people think it is waste. The main idea of ​​the film - Take the ego away then you will have real power! This was the main battle at the end of the film and Guy Ritchie showed it so brilliantly. "The big enemy will hide in the last place you look" - do you remember this from the film? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... It is this voice that always tells us that we are important, and this gives us our pride, which tells us not to give, but only to take, which creates our aggression, wants to be in control, Negative. GR has expressed this idea in an amazing way and showed that the only way to gain real control is when you lose control and you give up your personal importance. Wonderful movie!
