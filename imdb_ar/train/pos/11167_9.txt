This film, my favorite, tells of two rival characters in New York, Steve Brody (Raft) and Chuck Connors (Perry), both of whom strive to be the "main man" in the Pori in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> Brody (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a largely fictional account of their instincts (based on a play). The legendary Brodie (did he? ), A jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), which is famous for, is shown here as occurring almost at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). A great passion for this period, beautifully rewritten here, contains a rude and impassioned figure from the vocalist Tracy Udbray (young Bert Kelton). The bird is in the best shape as Prodi, and Perry shows again what an intelligent actor is, Sometimes Connors touches. Britti Fei and Ray are the love interest that boys seek to achieve. <br /> <br /> Filled with life and energy, "The Bowery" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early "talk"). It's not easy to find, but worth looking for.
