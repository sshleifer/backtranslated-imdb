Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, where filmmakers, editors, and very creative photographers are working on historical themes, what the Japanese call "cutting off the period." Gojoe is very creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Fantastic, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films gives a glimpse into the traditional beliefs of shamanism, demons and mysterious powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture but were not really explored in the samurai kurosawa or Zitoche series. Another good example of this type is Onmyoji (2001). Director Sugo Ichi will be one of the most interesting and creative directors of the Japanese wave. Among other pieces in the highly recommended Japanese period, Yumada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
