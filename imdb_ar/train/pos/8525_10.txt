In order to evaluate this film to some extent, you have to think about the kind that you are supposed to be: children. They had more instructions to follow in order to make this movie (which means that you can not get rid of some humor and / or language from the first) with all the footage in it was fun and enjoyable to watch. The tabels usually make me nervous, but this one did well for itself. Knowing that he did not have the power of Star Fraser where George took advantage of humor and I think Shoman took the lead. If you want to watch a movie and hope to honor Academy Awards, this is not the case, but if you want to watch a simple, fun and energy-filled movie you will make a good choice with this one.
