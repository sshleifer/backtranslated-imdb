Even without talking a word, Billy Connelly is as wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss "Mom"? Zombie friends? <br /> <br /> "... My father planned to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> I think the Dawn of the Dead was good. It's kind of like the meetings of the planes (the meat?) Night of the Dead Dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the coffin of my head <br /> <br /> Vido in the Aloha shirt is just a great way! <br /> <br /> Yes, social commentary is just too much to even start to comment on. <br /> <br /> Enough to say, everything really works!
