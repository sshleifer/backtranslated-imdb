Rating is only 5 because a movie can be better than acting and direction (or at least music!). However, with regard to Walt Whitman's achievements, it is worth 10. The poster depicts a cheesy movie poster, however, I think it's a simple case of not seeing forests for trees. It seems that filmmakers are more interested in getting the story out than they are on a Hollywood feature film. That is why I salute them - the fact that he is not even reflecting Whitman's life. This film is more documentary for acting. Being fascinated by a story like this, when you rarely hear about these types of stories that make up current mental health, is the most important thing. I found it a very enjoyable look in history.
