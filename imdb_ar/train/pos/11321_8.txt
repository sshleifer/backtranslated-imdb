When I started watching the show I said, "Oh, no! It's as strange as Elven Leid, not even bloody!" Indeed, the setup is almost identical, where the young boy lives in a big house alone, then suddenly intervenes in a wonderful adventure while the young girls who live together come together. <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity stops. The story of love is almost as subtle and intense as the story of Inuiyasha, while observations and childish behaviors are very few. The magical setup is a little strange, because it is about seven people, with seven employees, fighting for the Holy Grail, all the famous person staff, half all teachers of the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon dimming and fading from the beauty of drawing and text. <br /> <br /> I actually saw all 24 episodes in one day, and without comparing them to animists I liked them more, but I was of other types, I must say I was very happy.
