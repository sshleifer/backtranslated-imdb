Guys and Dolls is a film that governs for a remake. It was manufactured forty-eight years ago. Two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although the new version, with big stars now, will be a box office success, it will not be able to capture the magic that entered into this version. You can not restore its limitless energy, and you can not enjoy the exclusive joy you see when you watch something like this: a huge, wide entertainment movie, <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (last recorded at 409 pounds last time I heard it ) Play Sky Masterson, one of New York's biggest gambling. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, who is famous for the city-wide game of cheating often. However, when the place you left to keep it is $ 1000, Detroit needs money quickly. He bet on $ 1,000 for Masterson because he can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Men and dolls are basically no more than lyric and dance types, usually as here, add to the fun. It is clear to see how this was a musical play from Broadway: there were not many groups, and the scenes were long. If you would like to complain about one thing, it is the extent to which the songs are uneven. Sometimes, there were two songs in a scene; at other times, thirty minutes passed without one. Men and dolls are never boring, it's a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Uncategorized.
