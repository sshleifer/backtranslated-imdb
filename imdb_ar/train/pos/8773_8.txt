Flynn plays an ambitious and arrogant young man with a natural boxing talent sponsored by the exclusive Olympic club in San Francisco in the late 19th century. Despite being good-looking, being a "bald Irishman" and a social climber builds the discontent of Olympic club members; most of them can not wait to see him lose a battle, and brag against him. Despite this, he rises to fame, so he acts as an actor. He finally gets the chance he is waiting for, a match with the world champion, John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan is demanding $ 10,000 to ensure that Corbett appears to be fighting for $ 25,000. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) despair of getting money. However, assistance comes in the form of an extremely unlikely individual. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting movie, and Jim Corbett is a wonderful role for Flynn, who was himself a professional fighter at the same time. He has the required charm, looks good and athletic for this role. Alexis Smith plays the role of Victoria Ware, a romantic admirer who insists she is hated. In real life, it did not seem to exist; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career instead of boxing history. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and believed that he was the man who made the reward a form of art. In the film, Corbett is a fleet of feet and avoids being beaten by opponents. It is believed that John L. Sullivan this way. <br /> <br /> A good film to catch Flynn at the height of a very short time as a star.
