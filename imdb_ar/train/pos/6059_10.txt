This is an excellent documentary, full of beautiful pictures with a great race and story. IMAX cameras give you a very wide view, as it is a perfect DVD movie. You hear every speaker working almost all the time, not accelerating the film and giving you a natural feeling of 230 miles per hour. Of course there are some added sound effects but I think they are good, they give depth to the driving scenes ...
