All Dog's Go to Heaven is an unrivaled animated baby movie. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all conspicuous in the plot, and although the children will get a little of it, the adults are scratching their heads to see why this movie looks like a kind of gangster movies. The actual film is not explicit in any way, it is just a strange mix to produce a child movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds is a dog player with half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tiebak). After becoming drunk (a dog ... became drunk ... in a baby film .. It seems strange only), Charlie was cheated and killed by Carfax. When in paradise, he finds a way to return to earth, but he will no longer be allowed to paradise. He is still back on earth and meets his old friend, Dom Deluise, and plans to recover on Carfax. At the same time, Carfax has a small orphaned girl who was detained by Anne Marie because of her amazing ability to talk to all kinds of animals, helping to predict the species. Charlie and Echey released her, tried to help her find a family, and learned a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few Disney films that will attract both children and adults. Children will enjoy funny characters and animated animations, while adults enjoy a nice and wonderful plot and more than the usual characters. The only thing that keeps this is that he is a musician. Normally, this is a good thing, but the music here is terribly terrible. They tend to jump somewhere, which is almost a compressed audio ad, with no effective support. In fact, this may be the worst song I have ever heard in an animated film, but luckily, the rest of the film is strong enough not to collapse because of some bad comments. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It is sad, but happy, but more sad than happiness, makes the film feel that it needs to be supplemented. Considering how bad the sequel to this was, I wish that the finish had no justification for the complement and that it was concluded at a nice end and very happy. This is one of the few films I feel this way, but I do it. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a beautiful family movie, with strange themes thrown, but nevertheless, good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** From ****. 85 minutes.
