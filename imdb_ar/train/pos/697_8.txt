This is one of the first independent films I have ever seen. For such a very low budget, it was done well. As a psychologist, I can sympathize with my main character, although my sleep problems have never been severe or bothersome. <br /> <br /> Well, good conduct, for a theme I've never seen much in theaters, lighting, and putting both are perfect for preparing a movie. There are a few notable idiots, but may be meant; you'll see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and worth watching twice. There is no flawless film, but the Hollywood version could not do the story better. All in all, 8/10.
