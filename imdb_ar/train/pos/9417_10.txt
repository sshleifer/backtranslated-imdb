The film "The Man in the White Suit" is a modest, warm and thin film, another breath of fresh air in a film form from Ealing Studios. While I doubt that some modern viewers may find it at first vague, I doubt that many may fail to admire the way in which the plot is plotted, subjects and characters poorly during the course of the film. <br /> <br /> Fabulous really gives Alec Guinness another good characterization in a film that may not be as vividly creative as the "kind and tragic hearts" inspired by Ealing in 1949. This time, he plays only one role instead of eight, but he plays Role of inventor and world Sydney Sydney Stratton. Find the correct tone and expression. In addition to Guinness's hidden performance and crossing, the rest of the actors are effective. Among the key players will be Cecil Parker and Ernst Thesiger. Thesiger is considered silly as a disabled but influential business owner, while Parker is reliable as a landlord and non-developer but pivotal father. Father, that is, to John Greenwood, a comedian comedian, culminating in this film. She is influenced and seductive by the side and ambiguity, she is quite upscale in this film, quite unlike the unusual Guinness, but it is more surprising. The scene you are trying to seduce is presented with great skill by the couple, which is very touching and entertaining ... <br /> <br /> These subjects are dealt with very effectively, without easy ethics. The complexities of science, business and manpower relationships are examined with insight and pleasure. With the support of Alexander McKindrick, this film is technologically savvy in all areas; sensational photography, sound effects, music and sad texts are all quietly admired. A completely satisfactory film, with Guinness and brilliant Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
