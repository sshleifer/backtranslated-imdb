I was pleased to read Martin Torgoff's book, "I Can not Find My Way Home," which is full of information about the American drug culture, which spanned 1945-2000. This guy knows things !! I found him an excellent speaker for this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching the movie clips from the Hippie era, and the culture of the 1970s. The sound was excellent. Everyone who assembled it was definitely in touch with the melodies of every age. Hopefully they will pack them and sell them as a CD set. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the experiences of the 1960s will forever change American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Young (played by Johnny Depp in "Blow"), who was supposed to be responsible for many marijuana and cocaine coming to the country in the 1960s and 1980s.
