I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it all. When a widowed father interrupts two of his sons' sleep with the sudden revelation, they tear between his believing and not. When the horrific events unfold in this story, we learn a lot about the father and his sons and their destinies. With a shocking twist after a shocking development, this film never allows the plot to calm down. Bill Paxton plays the role of father, but the most prominent performances are the performance of his eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son Adam, played by Jeremy Sompeter. This is one of the best thriller films I've seen in a while, and you'll want to watch them several times to appreciate each intricate aspect of the plot. I give this film 9/10.
