Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were very natural and the Sogiyama shift was incredible. The result is very moving, it made me cry. The choreography was beautiful without being athletic. Mai's dances and her soft charm gave me a cry of terror. Tamako is a wonderful wonderful figure. You can see the magic girl in her face almost as she remembers seeing "The King and I". Oki's character is gay and compassionate. Masako is very natural like a stunning wife, and you want her rounded to hug her to assure her that everything will be fine.
