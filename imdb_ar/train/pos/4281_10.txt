One of my favorite "local" movies. I do not know if there is anyone in our country have not seen this movie! It is funny and sad at some moments ... I do not know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to see it) got this film, because you have to know some of the moments in our Serbian history and the character of Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, ! But as I see here, there is a person from Canada who saw it ... and loved it. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to figure out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
