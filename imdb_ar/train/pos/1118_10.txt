Well, this may be one of the most entertaining movies of all time, while Sandy performs fast! Unfortunately, her career never started, but - in the end - she will always remember her first three pictures: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". I worked in various personalities from the New York meeting to Diana Ross to create a hilarious hilarious critique of popular culture in America. It is exciting, fierce, tender, sensual, philosophical and sad. It convinces the audience in every scene, and is in fact "really beautiful". See this one (if you are not from Iowa), you will definitely enjoy it !!
