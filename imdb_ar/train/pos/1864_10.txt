I saw Anton Fischer on Bravo. What a wonderful movie and an unbelievable young man. This film is essential for anyone dealing with how to overcome child abuse and abandon them as adults. Denzel Washington plays a great performance in addition to the young man who plays the role of Anton Fisher. Cleenix Alert - Feel good and tears. The most sad moment is when he finally meets his mother, who took her away from the age of two months. One was more courageous when he stood with his sister's abusive sister. I watched this film on Bravo in 2008 and I wish I had known him for years. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD set.
