Canadian director Marie Haroun is a cultural tool that shows her previous films some artistic surplus from the late 1960s and 1980s. With her "notorious home page", drew her fixed gaze to the 1950s, an era steeped in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while she lived in the beginnings of sexual awakening that would lead to free love for the next decade. It is clear that Aaron and her writing colleague, Jennifer Turner, are not interested in the standard biography of the sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how she revealed her exclusive sexual life from both predatory instincts and unclean ideas to a culture untouched by the beauty of the naked body. If the details of my life are all that matters to the film, why would it end before the most tragic period begins. It is clear that Aaron is more interested in America's attitudes toward sexual images from time to time. Along with leading performance by Greten Mall and stunning outdoor cinematography for W.Mott Hupfel III, she has achieved this goal impressively and stuck to a mirror in the past while making the public study their "enlightened" attitudes of the 21st century towards pornography . With America choking under a new province, this movie is more than ever required.
