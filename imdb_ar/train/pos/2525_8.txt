Tony Hawk came out at the point where the series began to lose its luster. The Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series was different and fun. <br /> <br /> Underground presented the story model, which was great because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. There is another feature provided by the fans to a great extent which was able to get off the skateboard, which is great because you can now climb, jog and do all kinds of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft has also improved regarding the issue started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were fantastic and long and some of the features hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened due to a few features added and systems have been pushed up too. In this version, they shortened these features, there are not many people wondering about the streets, in fact there is almost nothing at some levels, graphics and graphics are reduced a little but not much skating. <br /> <br /> This game contains one trick, story stories are a bit short, and of course this is the first time Neversofts does this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, and that's understandable. However, however, this game will definitely end in a day. <br /> <br /> In general, a great addition was very refreshing.
