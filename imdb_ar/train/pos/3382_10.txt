I did not have a feeling often film can be insightful. But it is clear that this film contains a harbinger of obsession. <br /> <br /> We should not tend to be alarmists and see Armageddon in something because it seems to suit our emotions at this moment. But, did not say this from "1984"? James Orwell knew that the Internet had not really come true after 1984; in fact he was in 1994; he might have reconsidered his story the way he did it. Too late is rewarded. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What matters is that we often consider ourselves superior to our surroundings but in fact we become passionate about the "apple of love" when necessity knocks on our door. Take a snapshot of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> No matter what time line it will prove to us, I know the fact that we have not seen the beginning of it. <br /> <br />
