Beware spoilers. This movie was fine. Goldy Hoon and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Well, so the foreign man who was trading (spoiler here) was with the biker for his funny clothes. The boss of this man was also good. But the film really belongs to Sarandon and Hun. They must have a lot of time on the screen together. They chemistry was great. Bathroom Scene F! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Mort is a stupid cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up in the White House amid a conspiracy because of politicians' greed. To talk about Sarandon will be giving a lot away. The spoilers: This is a somewhat atypical romantic / political comedy, satisfying the political side somewhat more than romance. It touches on political issues, and hardly goes beyond romantic areas. <br /> <br />
