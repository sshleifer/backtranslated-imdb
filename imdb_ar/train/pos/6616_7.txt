This film I decided to go and see it because I am a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it is allowed to show the film as a piece of art rather than a show to show the actors' ability to change their styles. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely more about the style of the story. While I found the story interesting (an exciting film that borrowed the story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was a bit difficult to follow them at times, and I did not feel that all that might have been combined. He certainly had a mixed feeling of French animation and Japanese anime together. Whether it is or not, it is up to the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, in this sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animations, or want to watch a different film from most movies right now. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the movie experience but I was slightly disappointed because it could have been better
