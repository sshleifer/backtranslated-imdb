The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best roles ever), the latest child spy on the block, concludes his quest for his identity, also seeks to end the CIA's latest "Blackbriar" to make super killers like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so thoughtful about it that I saw it before yesterday and today. The identity was as wonderful as I remember, and excellence is still the weak link (but still fun) in the series to the weakest plot, apart from the chase cars that lead it chasing this film easily, lacking in action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, Ultimatum has a thrill! Even when you know that Bourne will escape from the authorities (and the boy plays these films to highlight the police as incompetent), it is still wonderful to watch him do so. It is amazing to think that two players with pistols and scooters could create 10 times more than anything else from the $ 150 million giant robots they made in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass, who has this distinctive style of shooting a documentary, even though it depicts characters far from normal, is in places like the CIA headquarters where no one is allowed 10 Miles using camcorder. He seemed to listen to various complaints with Supremacy. The work at Ultimatum is no less than inspiration. The various tools used as weapons are candlesticks, cover books (I will never look at things the same way again) and an electric fan (do not ask). The music also helped generate a lot of thrill, and there was never even a finish of nail bites. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Steele's character "Nicky" is placed in a very sympathetic new light. Damon plays his role as a reserve but efficient (which seems simple but it really seems as though Matt Damon can evade the CIA and Interpol), but moments of frustration as he is still struggling to find his humanity. This longing for him for real life can be boring and almost done in excel, but only works better in Ultimatum (best script). <br /> <br /> Remember a scene in "Goldeneye," in which Sean Penn's character asks James whether Martinez is ever silent about the screams of all the men killed. Bourne expresses his regret for all the people who killed them, and he (or at least made me think) the meaning of act without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government turned men into resources. Although the resources known as Krav Maga can make weapons of anything. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: It has always bothered me that, despite being arrogant and haunted by the CIA, Interpol and the police almost everywhere he goes, Bourne never thought of making even the slightest attempts to hide his features or Formulation of some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have vibrant films and thrilling movies, Bourne Ultimatum suits you. Hell, it's probably the best movie of the year. Of course, you will be foolish to see it without first watching others. This kind of cloud feels close to the finish, but I almost feel tempted to overlook it. This is the first film "3" this summer matches at least, if not exceeded, in the original film and he says something. <br /> <br /> A-
