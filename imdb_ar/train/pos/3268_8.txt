A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit complicated - I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. Enough to say it's worth watching. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is not realistic at all but it works. Everyone in the film is very nice and everything seems wonderful - it creates a romantic feeling through the entire film. <br /> <br /> The acting is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Sibyl Shepherd are at their best and enjoy every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine but okay. If you are a sucker for good emotional movies and erotic (like me), you can capture this movie. Downey also looks great in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Additional Rewards - Song title sung by Johnny Mathis and another wonderful song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Setera.
