Every country has a working film industry that has a sane (and perhaps crazy) artist who makes films that you can only fully understand when you are part of that country. I think Hundstage movie is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level in the society of Austria, dirty, troubled, strange, hated. But they still have enough money so they can buy tuned cars and large houses. They certainly do a lot of weird things here that may seem "normal" to them for doing so throughout their lives. From the point of view of ordinary human, you can now easily follow the film and disgust or intrigue and watch a wonderful piece of professional films in Austria. <br /> <br /> But if you live here you know the people you see in Hundstage characters as a community tumor. A society grows mad from day to day, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, the cave of the social order from within. And you see people. Sitting in the garden, standing at the corner of the opposite street, line up in the same row. You may meet them at a bar or disco you may visit. Maybe you work with them in your business or they live next to your home. Start with their hatred without knowing the exact cause. You'll try to get away - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems "normal" for you because you're doing it all your life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not bright though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. She has beautiful people ... but some are ugly too. There are a lot of people working hard and trying to do their best ... but there are also some people who ride on their backs and destroy everything that the people of Austria have done so far. <br /> <br /> Too pessimistic a movie.
