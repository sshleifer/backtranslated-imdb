I did not expect much from this film, but it was not bad; in fact it was very good. This film contained the most extreme parts of the writing I have ever seen in a film. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the most extreme films of all time, but I laughed hard at some parts. "The police ruled my father's death as suicide, they said he fell on the elevator shaft and in some shots." Now this movie is not for everyone, stupid idiot like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hate these movies, it is likely that I recommend you clear direction. In general, it was a thrilling film about a group of superheroes, who eventually became real heroes. It's a largely exaggerated comedy that probably has not been seen by many people yet, because like me before watching it they expect the trash to be absolute. After watching this film, I finally realized why this film was able to assemble such a supernatural actor that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Messi, Hank Azaria and even this kid by Good Burger. That's because the mysterious man is full of an excellent comic writing period of 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
