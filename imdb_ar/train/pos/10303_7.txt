Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, the ordinary man who feels that God spoils his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone the powers of God can take their turn towards the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman's first class, and he seems to be at home exactly where God and the actors gather the plot well. Jokes are always targeted, although they often resort to little Carrie facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film really portrayed God, not only that, but also as a black man. I thought this well, especially with the wonderful Freeman. There are some funny scenes, an opening cookie scene for example, others missing a little target but still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
