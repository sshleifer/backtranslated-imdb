I think the opening of 20 minutes of this film is probably one of the most exciting films that have been filmed, where the superb degree of music increases the tension to its peak. What movie pioneers of this in the 30s, I can only imagine. The Times said at the time, "A miracle has come to the screen." Watch it and wonder.
