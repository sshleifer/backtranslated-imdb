The first time I had a chance to see it all but the forgotten classic came back in the early 1980s, in one of our artistic homes as a revival. As I watched this dream fever exercise in sexual life in 1930, I thought YOWZA! They fled with murder in Europe again a day. Unfortunately, this film was heavily cut in its original version of the United States by the Blue Nose Hayes Office (the powerful government censorship panel, initiated by the Bible brawler "Worse than You", Will Hayes ... a former post office official, if you can Believe it), since it is a general theme of human sexuality (in the 1930s, human beings banned in the sky actually had sex). The Ecstasy plot involves a young woman (played by Hedy Lamar) who marries an older man and later regrets her. She (Lamar) meets a handsome and handsome young man and has an affair, resulting in a divorce from the ex-husband (another not in Hollywood movies at the time --- divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it may have been the first time the director worked in the audio format (for example, the film seems to have the techniques used mostly in silent films - 1920). It is still worth looking for a window of early European talk, along with Louis Bonewells, Lage Dur (1930), and Karl Gustave Drauer (1931). It is not classified, but it contains a nude celebrity scene and some veiled sexual references, which would yield little more than the PG-13 according to today's standards (but would have easily landed "X", again in the 1930s, if they exist)
