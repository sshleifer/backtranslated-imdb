I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was five years old and my family always saw this show. My favorite character was the character Marion Lorne played as a somewhat faltering person. I can still remember her comments titled "ubba bubba um um" because she will try to say something important. Then when I came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was wonderful! <br /> <br /> This was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, who has followed her as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question as to whether anyone can verify: The title or end attributes music to the "Swedish Rhapsody" of Hugo Alvin? Every time I hear it play on the classical radio station here in Southern California, it reverts the memories of Mr. Peppers' picture as he walks with his back to the camera. I'm not sure if this picture is correct in my opinion.
