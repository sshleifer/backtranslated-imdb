This is the film that made The Ramones a family name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). This was one of the best and best American Punk Rock movies, with a classic cult status with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, producers wanted the Cheap Trick to be the star, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" made them just stars and became a very hot element in the low budget movie. Very good luck for Rammons who were looking to get out of the evil rock world underground and into the main market (which unfortunately never happened until after the teams were gone). The band, especially Dee Dee, always hated the film during the 1980s, but fans always liked it and could read most of the movie while waiting to get into Ramones. This movie, like most classics, is fun with some stupid classic Ramones footage at its height. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. The other classic "Alain Arcush" in a similar vein is "Get Crazy," which features "Leigh Fing" from the legendary hard-core "Fair" band.
