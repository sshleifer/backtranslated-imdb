For the film that contains such a plot, I usually smell the "tearjerker" in the first 10 minutes and turn it off, but it was very good, with delicate emotional details, wonderful acting, and really funny moments. It was also interesting to see a different culture - a culture disappearing into it. My wife and I dug both!
