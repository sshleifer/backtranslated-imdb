Very cool view. The second season started where I ended up, with a lot of mystery. The thrill in most, if not all, episodes is ambiguity everywhere. The one that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can get out of all the contacts and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the life of the characters in the show meaningful. Never fail in excitement and I look forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will be revealed, and at the same time, more mystery will be resolved. Good selection also casts for this show, fit the characters perfectly. Really can not wait to discover the secret in the end. Hopefully all this noise will not spoil the end.
