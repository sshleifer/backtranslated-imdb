I saw this movie on Sky Cinema not too long ago. I have to admit, it was a really good western with two big names. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, playing the role of famous lawyer Samuel Borgad. On the other hand, the late James Coburn plays the role of evil Zack Provo .. seeks revenge from Burgad regardless of the cost ..! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was having some really good characters. Most actors played the game really well .. especially James Coburn, which I find was really interested in this film .. but so was .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who I've seen everywhere in other movies Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character had been left in the cold, but he managed to recover himself by collaborating with Burgade, to drop the poems of Provo! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great movie .. very good to watch .. a wonderful degree from the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> Wonderful piece of Western character ..! 8 of 10.
