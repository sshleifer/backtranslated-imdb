First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his films, you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are identical. His character in this film surpasses everyone so far ... and counting. The story begins in the future (not yet) where a man is sent to the past to find the source of the virus that has ravaged most humans from the face of the earth. The story seems to be going towards SF, but I think it's closer to the drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. For that. Films tend to be faster and slower at some points and eventually evolve more than the beginning, but as you see this film, you will recognize this constant rhythm of the story and uncover facts that do not speed up or slow down. It's one and the same speed that flows gently and very well. But that does not mean that the end will not pull your nerves, because the cause is good. As far as trend goes, it is conservative. Movies are easily destroyed by poor output, but this movie has become much better. So, if you're ready to watch Sci-Fi or some action, you'll miss it. There must be more movies like this.
