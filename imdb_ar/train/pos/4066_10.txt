Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings fun storytelling to the audience. It's the kind of movie that makes one feel like a child again; it's just magic. It's a long-time crime to be released in the United States, but now that you have verified it! Stick with the original language. The name changed my impressions of the characters to some extent, which should be avoided at all costs in translating a movie (or book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> Give it ten / ten.
