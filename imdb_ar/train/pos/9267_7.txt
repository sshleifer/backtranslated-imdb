Not a bad movie. In a way I was forced to really fuck the Iranians to win the game I played in the film even though I do not know anything about football and I am not a fan. The end of the bus was exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to enter sports courts among men because their swearing in is not suitable for women. Despite this law, some women try to infiltrate, but many are arrested and detained. It is really amazing that any society still has such old concepts of sex. In an interview, Panahi says that his films are documents of history and injustice, and that one day in the future we can watch these films and see how Iran lived one day. One hopes that the future will come sooner rather than later.
