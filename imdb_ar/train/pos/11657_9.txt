The surprise candidate for the best animated film race of the year at the Oscars. It's an Irish film by heart, but it was produced jointly by Belgium and Brazil, and I think cartoonists work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in modern memory. The character design reminds us of the French animated film Persepolis two years ago, with very simple characters with dense black lines. This movie is not black and white. No what makes this movie great is its use of colors, simply some of the terrible and amazing uses of the colors I have ever seen. The overall design of the images is also much more geometric, with rectangular or oval figures essentially. You can spend a large part of the movie while playing find the circle - one of the main aspects of the visual circle design in the center of the image. All these engineering designs have a purpose - the story revolves around a young boy who learns to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (Kelas is a true evangelical book; the art of the film depends on the drawings in it). The film's story is not particularly deep, but it's a good fairy tale. Brendan is a small boy in Kels, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to keep the Viking away. The newcomer to Kills, Brother Ayden, inspires Brendan in the illustration. He also inspires him to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby woods where the mermaid lives. Bruno Coulais offers a great score, almost as good as his score with Coraline, which I consider the best throughout the year.
