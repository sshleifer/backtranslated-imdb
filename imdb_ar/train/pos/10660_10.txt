I found this movie almost interesting from the beginning. When Miss Stanwyck begins to tell her, it takes only a few minutes to realize that the problem will happen. The abandoned area, the lock on the door of the abandoned fuel station, everything puts you on hold ... here comes. At first, you think it's about the little boy, but you'll soon see your breath. The glory is that this movie is really cumbersome, although I've seen it before and you're ready to cancel it. Now a movie can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before worth some kind of your rating, maybe a white knuckle award?
