Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece to convey a message with a few words. It has been one of my favorite ten films since its debut. I'm still waiting, even less impatient, until the movie appears in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If Amazon's parent company lists are correct, there are many people who want this address in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this scenario. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The stunning cast, cinematography and direction are impeccable. The film is a definite guard. Much has already been requested. Please add our names to the list.
