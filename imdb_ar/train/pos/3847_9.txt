At this time, this film had been controversial (like most Verhoeven projects). <br /> <br /> Contains very graphic scenes, death scenes; a parachute that does not open * slap * men body on earth. A man eaten by a lion * chomped loudly * in the throat. A man running by a speedboat * magnification * a bloody body goes down. <br /> <br /> But beside the jar, this picture contains some spectacular (and amazingly beautiful) scenes, filmed in the gray city of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of puppet monkeys fly over the screen, In a somewhat irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful woman puts the flowers in a milk box, surrounded by sheets of flesh that pours blood and a lively love scene between two male characters, in a graveyard. <br /> <br /> The story ends feverishly, but it takes 10 minutes, do not disappoint, and will leave you sighing at rest. <br /> <br /> Of course with the pros come negatives, some special effects are too much and are clearly done to see how far Verhoeven can press the unfair factor (for example, many eyeballs hanging from their sockets). Also, while the main actors (Gerwin Krabi and Rene Sutendek) do an excellent job of enlivening their characters, Hermann's character (portrayed by Tom Hoffman is somewhat charming) feels completely backward, making it difficult to care for, even after His tragic death. <br /> <br /> I have done my best to give you a simple idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing film, and as you can see, it can not be easily summed up in words. So prefer yourself, if you come across this movie somewhere, watch it! Enjoy the unique style and essence of this masterpiece.
