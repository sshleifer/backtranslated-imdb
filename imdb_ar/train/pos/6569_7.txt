"Jake Speed" is a wonderful movie with a wonderful message. Of course its disadvantages. Sometimes it's a bit slow. He presents the villain very far from the story. Is a fast paced snail heart rate. It has a Z-class crew (although I've always been impressed by the work of Karen Cobbins, who has a wonderful look from Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all this happening against her, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to an enchanting scenario by Wayne Crawford (who plays starring) and Andrew Lin. <br /> <br /> Why do I find him so inspiring? Because he says to me, "Hey, why do not we try to be a good person." <br /> <br /> The story is essentially "Strange in a Strange Land", a good idea about Jake Speed ​​is developed in the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than just a scout boy. It is more than a Knight in a shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is a saint of optimism in a dirty, mediocre and evil world. <br /> <br /> For this reason, Jake Speed ​​really needed to be successful. It has a great message that should have reached Hollywood and then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that has really pushed itself to portray good and generous people. I'm not saying we should watch Waltons at every theater in Cineplex, but it would be nice to get more movies like "Jake Speed" on the chance. ("South South", a TV show about Canadian Mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons but the general message is that if you try hard Enough to be a good person, you will defeat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99
