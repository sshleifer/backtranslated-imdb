The main reason for seeing this film is Warren William, who is campaign manager. He is an electrician, constantly finding ways to deceive the public and defeat the opposition party amidst the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he did not get his dues. The House of Davis shines in the role of his girlfriend. Personally, I found that Jay Keppe is not quite right as a lame candidate William and others are trying to put to the public. It looked more like an empty cloth than a person. I'd rather see a real character appear rather than be impersonal. The story itself is unreasonable, silly and cliche. But Warren William and Pitt Davis deserve to be seen.
