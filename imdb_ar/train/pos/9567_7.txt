I watched the DVD for this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in English). It appears in Cambodia (English subtitles say the character speaks Thai but the film says Cambodia) is a very violent villain who raises children to be killers who use hunger and train them to fight and kill. Pang sends to kill some people in China and during the killing killed a policeman partner. Policeman Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop shot in a coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and worried about Wai's faulty behavior. He does not know that Wai is the one whose father flared with drug dealers and shot him and put him into a coma. "Bang does not speak Chinese and does not understand this, but she saves her from her." The father who seems to have sex with her may be the reason behind the third cat, and he is hiding in a muddy garbage hut where he meets a woman who comes here to find her mother and keeps repeating that her father will not let her leave. . Wai became increasingly obsessed with getting Pang but Pang could almost be stopped. Even after Bang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where he marries and becomes a WAY carrier and joins the evil man (who trains the boys) he makes a deal to fight and train so he can get Bang. There is a great confrontation between Wai and Pang with the woman who was terribly mistreated by the main victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang to rule out his dead mother's baby just to die and leave him as a potential future child to be raised as a killer. This film was filmed beautifully with excellent soundtrack. There are many scenes of very brutal violence. The woman with a long nail pulled out of her feet. Knives on the neck and trunk. Guns were fired directly on the head. And many very severe beatings. They may be bleak and pessimistic but certainly worth seeing.
