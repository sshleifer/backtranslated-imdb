A couple (Janet and Richard) come out in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple resorts to what is believed to be an abandoned farmhouse. Soon, a couple of convicted fugitives appear, and after a great delay to the inevitable, he begs to rape Janet and lock Richard in a cage for the birds. <br /> <br /> This latest film on LEFT must be one of the most disrespectful horror films ever made. It is one of the most twisted shocks of the early 1970s. Moreover, I found this beautiful and charming in its harmful accent. I LOVE CAGED TERRORISM. Music certainly helps to give a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty. I found the movie quite creepy. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages are primarily about directing the film, that is, the film is somewhat slow. Although I was not inhibited by the speed due to the beauty of the film and its suspense, I think it will lead to most people. Representation is not very good nor is dialogue, at least in early scenes. This film needs more patience than usual, which is really not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was good. Not the greatest horror film I've ever seen in my life, but it's certainly a lot of fun. Not exactly the easiest film can be found. You can find them in the user section in many stores if you are looking hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema, it's definitely worth checking out.
