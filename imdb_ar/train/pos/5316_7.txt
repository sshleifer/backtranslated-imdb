This is the second film I have seen about Ida Lubinu as a director after a hiking trip. I think this film was better than the film. This girl has a girl about to get married, then sexually assaulted and does not like anyone who looks at her and talks about her until she evades and takes a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is correct just to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
