In this irony of "war" and "gentleness" of war, John Kozak plays the role of Brand Hauser, a murderer sent to "Turkestan" to remove Omar Sharif, who is doing some oil work that will raise the problem of former vice president of the United States Private Company. In addition, Hauser must reconcile his fake location with a producer of trade shows, a wedding for pop star Unica (Hilary Duff) and a liberal liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tome). <br /> <br /> Assessment of technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The representation (by the main characters, at least) was good, as expected. It is clear that some of John Kozak's dialogue was not written for him because he often seemed uncomfortable when he said so. . . Perhaps unrealistic is more accurate. Joan has performed wonderfully, and is often a joy. Marisa Tomei, although I was not her fan at all, was not more than suitable for the role and worked well. Hilary Duff, however, was very terrible. They needed an attractive Middle Eastern star (or Russian, or whatever is supposed to be the tone) pop star. Unfortunately, they went with it 0 vs. 3. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the writing seemed to be a bit harsh and unmatched at some points, especially the John Cusack dialogue. Not much of it, mind, but some. The story also got some irony at points, which is good for a bit of irony, but it took a whole new level here. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei have a relatively calm and quiet appearance, making a pleasant mix of movie frenzy and actor level. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who was previously dehydrated by the real credits in his name, did a good job with a wide-screen film. I have treated the small budget ($ 10 million) very well and extended it to make it look much more. Seftel also successfully blended humor. . . With the painful parts that are difficult to watch from the real war (including the slaughter of civilians, etc.) <br /> <br /> - As far as public satire goes, its exaggerated view of war marketing is very good, especially the announcements of "Golden Palace Poker "On American tanks. In some stages, the film becomes too much, but in the end, it still accurately depicts what happens to the young "Mil Brooks" style. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very well presented well for the meager budget and definitely worth a look. It will not go down as one of the movie's marvels, but it certainly is not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
