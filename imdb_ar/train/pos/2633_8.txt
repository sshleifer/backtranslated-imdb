I must be honest, I was expecting a very bad failure, because it really seemed like they were trying to milk the original movie for the money. But this was not the case with this funny film (sometimes odd). I liked how to tell the story of Timon and Pumba, and the story with Simba and having trouble sleeping was funny. The bubble is a Jacuzzi, and when Bomba leaves, the bubbles stop. Everything is enjoyable and painless, good for children and some adults. I think this film will last for a while because it's good to have a direct movie to video and DVD. While the film seems odd and kind of tracks in the end, it works. 8 of 10
