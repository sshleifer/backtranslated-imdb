I loved this show when it was aired on TV and smashed me when I discovered that someone decided somewhere that it was not worth the follow-up! I've commented for years on my copies of this show, the ones I've recorded or my own video. So far. The powers that have finally been identified to issue this beautiful series on DVD have finally managed to get my small hands eager for the whole set. Which, take me to this part; the part about that this show is all about. <br /> <br /> The American Gothic revolves around the evil verses, essentially a conflict between Lucas Buck (Buck, B). He is a wicked sheriff of a small town in South Carolina who runs things the way he wants to run things and stops at nothing to get his way. <br /> <br /> I felt that the program had been written and directed beautifully and much of life was not left. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's how it looks to me when I finally find what's worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole has done a wonderful job like the role of Sheriff Lukas Pak, who has just as much magic as the evil spells to drag him. The other actors did a great job too, so I think you can say, so the actors have had great success with me.
