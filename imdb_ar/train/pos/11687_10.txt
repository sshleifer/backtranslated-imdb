My pride in Chris Rock differs from his films. I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in this film after him. Well this is the best he has yet, he did not expect this to be good. I closed my ass all the time. Chris Rock presents a wonderful sweet story backed by some of the most entertaining comedy I've ever seen. loved it.
