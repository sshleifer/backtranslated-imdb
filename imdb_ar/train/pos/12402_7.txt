**Warning! Forward spoilers! ** <br /> <br /> This abbreviation is one part of two that explains the short part of the "matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix became. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not a surprise; the short is not as entertaining as the information. But so it was presented, as a file in historical archives. Visual images are better than average, and cold colors generally help the purpose of the shortcut. <br /> <br /> There is a problem in the couple. The violence of the story is somewhat unjustified, along with the occasional dose of political precision (UN scenes), detracting from the direct narrative of the short story. In addition, it needs to be seen with the completion of the second part. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is great, and despite some problems, this shortcut still works. Will not be appropriate for the original film in terms of style, content or flow. This is the ideal way to detect the registry. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: good information. It could have been said a little better, but still solid 7 out of 10.
