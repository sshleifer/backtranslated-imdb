They may have passed some of the start - I'm not sure why it's in the Asian part of Turkey. If the reason for this is to start in the Mediterranean, it would be possible to get close to the beginning in modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> When cameras and crew arrive at the Bakhtiari tribe, it begins a 48-day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this wonderful journey across what seems to be the fast-moving Karon River. They use rafts that are maintained standing on their feet by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs are removed. The other "river bank" was steep - I guess a 60 degree rise. <br /> <br /> Just watching it was incredible, but there was more in the future. To reach pastures, they also had to cross a large mountain with almost snow, if not more. The ability to climb this mountain was wonderful in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only drawback to this documentary was some interactive headlines with bad attempts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a documentary from the silent age, or the amazing challenges that not only this tribe faces, but overwhelm it. This is just an amazing document for an unknown group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
