I think this movie is very fun and terrifying. I love Elvira and I love this movie. It is very unfortunate that the second part of this wonderful film did not work, because it is very funny like the first part. I also regret that besides this film, I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I hope to see it in the future in the third part of the adventures of Elvira. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actors. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and that my heart will be with you. You can rely on. What can I add more? This is a wonderful and classic movie!
