Well, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the eighty kind of this kind of movies, because you no longer see such a video anymore! I want to ask you all the people who say that this is just a slap, or a cheesy tradition. What is tradition? I've never seen another film like this, well, and not scary anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, about the popular group in the school, which wants to make everyone live hell, so they decided to choose this naughty boy named Marty. It turns into death when one of his little pranks is really hurt. <br /> <br /> Thus, after 10 years, the group of friends who have hurt Marty start getting high school reunion messages. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! So, they go back to old school, and fail one by one ....... Yes, you probably know what is happening! <br /> <br /> The only disappointment is the end. It could have been neglected, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try it, and try not to be embarrassed! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
