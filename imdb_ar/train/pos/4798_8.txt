This is not a film for the likes of Lynch Lynch. Instead, it's for those who appreciate a good story, or tired of the things tyrannical about it with public passion and the opera of the nest "This is a wonderful movie! - Semantics (it's right, once!). <br /> <br /> The story unfolds flawlessly, and we embark on a journey that I think most of us will come to sometime. An emotional and existential journey where we make adjustments for our past as we approach our inevitable demise. <br /> <br /> Impeccable acting, cinematography similarly (also sometimes very cool!), and dialogue is hardly enough for the viewer to understand the details or the story. <br /> <br /> Warm movie. Not overly emotional.
