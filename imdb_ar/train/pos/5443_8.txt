For what it is, this is a very good movie. I love Jones Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give a strong performance. Attention to love is fine, but this film more than just a good history film. I love Harleys, and I hated seeing them paint on "14 coats of paint that have been rubbed manually" with Old Drake Olive. There is a small historical lesson here that Harley Davidson motorcycles played a major role in World War II. I do not know if training such a cluster! The movie kept my interest along the way without being slower anywhere, with a good ride sequence. I love looking at the demographics of the voting date - I gave an 18 year old guy a 10 movie (a real bike lover, I guess). I will not give it 10, but I gave it 8. Do not weigh each film the same size. There are big budget movies, with great reps, you expect to be good, when they fail they fail tremendously. (Star Wars - The first episode is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought the episode I was weak compared to. So you get a lower rating than me from this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
