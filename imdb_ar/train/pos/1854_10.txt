After developing a critical eye for the film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antoine Fischer with my breath holding a pomegranate. While I'm a fan of Denzel Washington - both his skill as an actor and his public character; I'm impressed enough to admit the (very few) times he did not score a movie or two. I may be wrong about these - after all, I am not an actor. But this was different - Denzel poured his career experience in and directed to a film dealing with one of the most sensitive subjects that man knows - child abuse. As a debut directive, no less. He developed the film to indicate that he would successfully deliver a man's victory. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a film full of promises reached among diverse audiences, and gave inexperienced scenes a brief, but honest eye in the life of a young man whose childhood was the living hell, but who won despite everything. He did this film - and his eye proved dry of any color in the theater. You need to know someone in this movie to see when the truth is presented. It takes a talented director to tell you the story convincingly when you have not tested it. If he can attract more of the audience, and make the audience respond emotionally, without pity, the director did his work. In any film black, white, purple or dotted. This is what makes cinema good. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Locke, Joey Bryant, and most of all, Anton Fisher - I've already won.
