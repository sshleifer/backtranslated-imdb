Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee (The Crouching Tiger) is another jewel in this wonderful filmmaker's cover. For those who are not familiar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. Along with some wonderful motion pictures (sometimes bloody). This is a story of love and sincerity between men and one woman in particular. She is the star of Toby Maguire and Scott Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and as a young jewel, I have never heard or seen her, I want to see more of her.) The actor is first class, superb production values, well written (adapted from a novel) > This is a 128-minute long film, but worth watching. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> respectively <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
