what's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, it is filled with traffic. <br /> <br /> In the last film of Bruckheimer, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's all about naming. With characters like Kip, Sway, Sphinx and cars manufactured with names like Diane, Sue and Eleanor elusive, it's just a non-stop movement that keeps you from wanting to play the name game only. <br /> <br /> Not a deep text by any means, but a great way to work as Nicolas Cage while Memphis Rains with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duval left the car to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A new version of the cult story of 1974, may not be dedicated to the same cultural status but amusing. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that makes you watch you do not watch acting. Despite being full of stars, none of them has a notable performance, including a very poor performance by one of my favorite players, Giovanni Ribesi. Even Jolie, who won the Oscar recently, is just barely symbolic attention at any time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and car chases participate in making a great movie? I think so. We are pleased to take a look at the film, and although a certain scene takes you to an unlikely world, the work does not stop and suspends suspense. Just be careful of other drivers who are fighting for a polar job as you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 5
