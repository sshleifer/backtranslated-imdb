Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. We saw the parents "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we loved it, but we did not like it because we loved the "special day". I think Itur Scola is too short: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his recent films were disappointing. Thus, yesterday night, I and my mother sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinematography, design and result were a careful and precise design, but what I liked more was the chemistry between Lorraine and Mastroi. They are excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriel. Antoneta Housewife: Married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get an award for mega-families. Gabriel is simply against fascism. They spend a special day together, on that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to spoil the plot: go look for this movie!
