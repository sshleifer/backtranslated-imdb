Usually, I do not watch motion movies because of the fact that they are usually fairly similar. This film contains many scenes of motion picture stereotypes, but the characters and originality of the film's premise make it much easier to watch. David Duchovny moderated the approach of normal representation, which was wonderful to see him. Angelina Jolie, of course, was pretty and did a great job. Cast everything together. You should see for people who are bored of the same old motion film.
