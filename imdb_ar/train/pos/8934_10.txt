Two things chase you all over L'intrus: Who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you see? The end is so horrible that you fail for a while to answer any of these questions. The intruder floats as different personalities, different men in different circumstances do not belong to the scene, so they are expelled from him, gently or brutally, but often without emotional interference. The main character, Lewis, is a respectable man. He has difficult ways, others mean function and has no heart. He needs one and then goes. He has a implanted heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his quest for salvation? Such a man can cut your throat when a hat falls. You know that but Claire Dennis does not encourage you to judge him. Sometimes, there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who governs him. May be punished. But not Dennis. There is the character played by Beatrice D., who does not want anything to do with him: Do not touch me, she says. But Denis allows this man to be himself, and pictured him in his search for self. I do not know if her films are the heart or the mind but they are not the basics of the traditional plot. Whatever movies, you'll get them in the end. You know who the "infiltrator" is, you know the reason, more or less, some scenes come back to your mind in its full sense. But was it a film or a dream?
