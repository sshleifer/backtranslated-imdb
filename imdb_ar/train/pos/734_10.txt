This movie is a jolt of rocky rock fun, from start to finish. Ramones, who ruled the evil rock princes in the late 1970s, appear to be themselves. PJ Soles plays Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock and roll. An obsessed countryside writer writes songs for Ramon, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rock, and encourages her fellow students to join her in her cheerful instincts. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the school attended by Reeve hired a completely new director on behalf of Ms. Tugar. She's tall, intimidating Amazon for a woman. It promises to make students "walk." She even has two students who act as observers, who report them with dirt on their classmates. Mrs. Togar is particularly determined to capture Riff, and to put a stop to the Riff dwarfs in the mess. But Riff has clever ways to thwart Togar, at every turn. <br /> <br /> Glory to the wonderful performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Director of Togar. Mary is the legendary B movie actress. In this film, she played the role of fascist Mrs Tougar, with a sarcastic flavor. PJ Insoles as Riff, turns in electrifying performance. Clint Howard enjoys as a dual Eaglebauer, with a lot of fun with his role. <br /> <br /> Ramones performs many of their successful songs in this film. Thus, the viewer sees why Rammons' influence was very impressive, in the rock scene of Punk in the 1970s. Sure, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not in the Ramones or Punk rock, this movie is a great blast (literally) for active fun.
