This movie contains so many wonderful elements to it! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is, of course, wonderful, but she is also her chemistry with Jason London. The result is wonderful, serene and pure. James Newton Howard enhances the quality of any film he has created ten times. He also seems to have talent in the Lost Days movies, and he will certainly get his ratings in Peter Pan's modern film and the gruesome Gothic music of The Village. I saw this film for the first time at about 13 or 14, and now I'm not just crying at the end, I've been given tears or two because of nostalgia. Show this movie for your daughters. You will end up becoming a comfortable film for life.
