This is not a comedian Robin Williams, nor is Robin Williams the odd / villain of recent erotic fame. This combination of classic drama without overstatement, blends with Robin's new love of excitement. But this is not an exciting story in itself. It is more than a puzzle / suspense game in which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his bodyguard. <br /> <br /> Also starring in Sandra Oh and Rory Kulkin, this suspicious drama is pretty much like a news report, until Williams approaches the character of his goal. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was very happy, even though this film failed to teach, guide, inspect or entertain. I felt like I was seeing a man (Williams), actually doing things, from a third person's perspective. In other words, it seemed real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth watching, although it's definitely not Friday night / Saturday. <br /> <br /> An evaluation of 7.7 / 10 of the ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
