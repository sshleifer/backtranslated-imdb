At first, I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it appeared on my guide, so I looked for it on IMDb and I thought the cover looked so great so I thought I would try a film like Elephant. <br /> <br /> As soon as I've surpassed the fact that I'm supposed to hate the character of Alicia, who played excellently by busy Phillips, I realized what this film did well to establish the relationship between Alicia and Diana. Alicia means to Erika Christensen that Diana plays almost throughout the entire film, but we have finally discovered that although they are polar opposites, they have something in common with being present in the shooting. They share the unity and to what extent the film's progress is revealed. <br /> <br /> I just want to say how much I loved this movie and I was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even pass the elephant because it seemed to take advantage of the tragedy of Columbine. This film on the other hand was convincing and realistic. Philips busy acting off the chain !!! This is a good thing and I would love to see its progress in some of the most mature roles.
