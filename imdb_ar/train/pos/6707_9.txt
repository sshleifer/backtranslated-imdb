I sometimes know they are really really cocky ... but the acting is awesome and Melissa Joanne Hart is nice like a button. I like this show a lot, and I feel almost embarrassed because I am b / b. For being really tacky, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes the budget can be very low - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with them ... like Sabrina's father is two different men throughout the film ... I mean, can not they just say it was a uncle or something who is this? Still, I can only love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a nice couple and a very hilarious peace. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite ring is "Pancake Madness" ... Awesome episode. Maybe the best season is 3 ... I'm not a fan of some of the shifts in season seven ... Once you join college, Morgan joins the group and her dialogue is painful and very bad ... In addition to being ugly, Which revolves around how she survived her beautiful appearance ... but I think it was set for a really good season and I was so sad to see one of my favorite programs was canceled!
