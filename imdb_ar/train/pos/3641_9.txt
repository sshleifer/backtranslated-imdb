This movie contains many things. It's a story "I feel good." The characters and actors are a lovable, realistic and present performance. The most important thing, I think, is that Dennis Quid knows how to catch and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good at throwing the bat in "The Natural", as did Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In "Major Major League", Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what they were doing, but many others did not, and that picture was pure absurd - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> A lot of previous baseball movies, even when the stories are interesting, made such a shortage about baseball ability by potential clients, they were funny in that regard. In "Stratton's Story" and "Strategic Air Leadership," Jimmy Stewart seemed more credible as a professional baseball player, as a superhero and non-athlete, older in softball in family reunion, and other strong and physical stars (Gary Cooper, Girig, Ronald Reagan in the role of Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Dan Dayley in the role of Daisy Dean) degree of baseball ability that would place them in late rounds while "pick-up" to play on a Sunday stroll (even if mixed, even if your uncle Involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of Quid's high-school team, and the scenes of his experience with Devil Rays, who play with him in two small tournaments and in the American league, are all true. Participants are reasonable and capable. In addition, he is an attractive actor who always presents a gifted and appropriate description (except, to some extent, some of his "outstanding" scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis). But it is definitely targeted here, this film "9", good, or better, like anyone else of this kind, except "natural".
