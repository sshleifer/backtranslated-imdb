This fairly entertaining comedy film about Murphy's Law was being applied to home ownership and construction. If a movie is produced like this day, the family will be flawed. Since he was appointed in the "simpler" 1940s, we have assumed what is supposed to be a typical family of the times. Of course, Grant mixes between comedy and dramatic elements and works with more qualified qualified actors, most notably Loy and Douglas. Chenigani makes entertainment for 90 minutes, 7/10.
