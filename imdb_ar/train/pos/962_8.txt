I just finished watching this movie, and I must say I'm very impressed. Everything about him was wonderful. Acting characters, story. A reasonable child stepped up to brave, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not keep my eyes away from this film for fear of losing something. It is a tale / tale with ethics, cute and scary orcs and "monsters" but nevertheless intimate folk. A child is challenged and intimidated in school and becomes a hero. He was chosen to be a contender at the local village festival and a trip to Mount Epre, where he discovers Yokai, an amazing creations proud of Brian Frod. The evil Kato and Sardeh who definitely needs a hug. These wicked people pick up Yukai and throw them in a red hole along with undesirable things, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and mingle in horribly violent robotic monsters whose only mission is to kill. It is Takashi, a little boy, who will become their savior, along with a red man / dragon, turtle man, and river princess, as well as a cute little creature, if he could turn her into a pet game and sell it in all good toy stores. Especially good fonts do not try children at home and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. Suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a bit sad. Not necessarily that. Cheers Furdion
