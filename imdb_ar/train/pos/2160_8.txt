This film revolves around a man who was very involved in the conference of acceptable success, trying to be always mobile, working hard to be proud of owning his home. He assumes that this is all life in order to dance accidentally, all because he wanted to take a closer look at a beautiful girl he sees next to the dance studio every day while riding the Metro on his way home. <br /> <br /> He was fascinated at first, as he went to the dance class just for his expression, but finally allowed himself to leave and introduce himself to dance. It finally becomes clear to him that there is more in life than working yourself to death. A group of eccentric characters also learn in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughter and a feeling of interconnectedness between the absentees. Admire them, and give them some depth by showing their stained past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also fun, with great competition at the end, but it's not the usual story where we face the underdog getting out at the top by winning. Instead, there are flaws, revelations and abstracts. <br /> <br /> All of these things make a movie animated and enjoyable to watch.
