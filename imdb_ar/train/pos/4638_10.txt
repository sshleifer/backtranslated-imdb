I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. Hebrew is not fluent, so the translation was very useful, and I did not feel lost at any time in the film. You tend to get used to translation after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie surprised me !!!!!! It depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both areas of conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film reaches its climax in tragedy when anger and anger lead one lover to one extreme! Absolutely a must see!
