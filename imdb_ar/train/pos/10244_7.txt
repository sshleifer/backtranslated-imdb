I will not call "We've returned! Dinosaurs story" simply a copy of Jurassic Park. I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it questions the security of bringing beings from one era to our time. But it really opens my eyes when I see who voted: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To rephrase: A certain actress, a woman "Cheers", host of "Tonight Show", the most trusted names in the news, a famous cook, the police chief of "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of three Amigos CNN guy. <br /> <br /> But I think I should not just focus on the cast. I thought that this film contains something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it is an escape, but it is a conscious type. I would actually like to say that John Goodman is making a Rex sound here and is kind of a prelude to his vocal work at "Monsters Inc". worth watching.
