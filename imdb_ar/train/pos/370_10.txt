I have seen this film at least fifty times, and after seeing it last week for the first time in a long time I still feel it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was amazing, but it came alive thanks to Spielberg's experience and wonderful actors including Wobi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserves Oscar nomination for her short but strong portrayal of Nieti. <br /> <br /> You will experience all the feelings of humanity while watching this movie. I laughed, cried, and was angry. Like most great films, the Academy looked at a wide range of nominations but did not win. But this film, no doubt, is certainly one of the best films ever.
