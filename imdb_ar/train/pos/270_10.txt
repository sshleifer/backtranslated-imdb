I must say, seventeen and missing are much better than I expected. The perception I took from the reviews was that it would be just wet but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive puzzle. <br /> <br /> Didi Pfeiffer is Emily, or insists on her daughter Laurie (Tegan Moss) not attending a graduation ceremony called One Week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off the party anyway. When Lori does not return home, Emily realizes that something is wrong and begins to get insights for her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & Missing is better than many other TV movies of this genre, because it is very unpredictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this movie, and most of it explodes as believable. LMN Original was shown last night. 10/10
