Conrad Hall went with a bang. The great cinematographer finished his brilliant career with this film before it continued. He is proud of himself because this is one of the best crime films you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the shows! The amount of activity here is just right, too: not too much; not too little. <br /> <br /> Honestly, no characters here are "good people" because Hanks is a professional man in the leadership of Newman. The quality of replacing the only Hanks is the unwillingness of his young son to end a murderer like him, even though he teaches him how to be a man smuggled in robberies! Hey? <br /> <br /> Just as effective and interesting as the story, the real star of this film is the cinematographer's hall, which paints the scene after a beautiful scene with his lens. His work is wonderful.
