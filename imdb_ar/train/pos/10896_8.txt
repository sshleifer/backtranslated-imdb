At first I did not think Ben Affleck could actually get a funny Christmas movie, a boy who was wrong, my daughter invited me to see it and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Abelagate, Catherine or Hara was very good, and the story is what I really sold, I also mean, put my family, on the table for people who only see them but once or twice a year, maybe not In any case, you really need a lot of alcohol because your system is capable of dealing with Christmas, so I thought the hypothesis was good, and buying the family for $ 250,000, was a little on the far side, but it turned out to be good Very to me, because it was a riot all the time, it shows the conflict Left for different families. It has a lot of funny moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager boy. All in all I loved this movie and I will see it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too.
