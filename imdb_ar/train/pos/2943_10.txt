I think this is still the best routine. There are others, such as Rock's "Bring Pain", and because "The Men Are Horses" is hilarious. "Damon Wins' last position" is also funny in a dreary way - but this routine does not contain any errors. All jokes are funny, 70 minutes time perfect. Just long enough for 20 years. I just like how to allow the audience to be completely and completely unrestricted. I admire the classics and see a lot of Jim Carrey watching a more comfortable comedy which is great. Do not put a class with Elaine and Newhart, but you can see something if you're swollen. Thanks Eddie, God bless you.
