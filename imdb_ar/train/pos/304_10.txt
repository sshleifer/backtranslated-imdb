I watched it a few years ago. I remembered that it was a very vague case, a mixture of sad things, such as Dorothy's fate and Bogdanovich's personal future. <br /> <br /> I go to see my VHS version, then I review it more and more. At present I am waiting for a DVD version, at any cost, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy to listen music are chosen very well from the first second, a bit of blue, but also happy. <br /> <br /> All the characters are wonderful to me, with funny situations, a wonderful representation and a lot of dialogues that turned this into a cult film for me and a lot of people I met online or movie clubs. This may not be a victim. <br /> <br /> I think the title is hope in life! You should be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know this may be a special comment for the film, but the fact is that I liked it a lot, and I think this movie has been marked on me and I will never forget it.
