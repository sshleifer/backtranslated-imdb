"One of Hong's best efforts early on, humor is parked in parts where Hong tries to mimic Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also where Hong enjoys the fun of Drunken Master from Jackie Chan." The work is also very good, especially when Hong meets three martial arts experts It's not the greatest film, but it's good for the Kung Fu 1970s, especially if you're a fan of Hong and / or Lee. /> <br /> Samo Hong is a rural pig herdsman moving to Hong Kong to fight some bad guys wandering around Samo to impersonate the deadly Bruce Lee when fighting! <br /> <br /> This movie is often described as a parody of "Entering the Dragon" by Bruce Lee, but it is not exactly ... Samo is a rural pig herd - obsessed Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small outdoor restaurant.The new job is forced to defend the restaurant from local gangsters who seek protection funds.When Sammo becomes a combat mode, he moves on to impersonate Bruce Lee, Which must be considered incredible! This film is very dirty, in many scenes of fighting, Samo fights against people who are obviously actors and not military artists, and there is one character supposed to be black and played by an Asian man in a heavy (slut) structure. But what the film lacks in budget and precision is more than air and energy compensation. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
