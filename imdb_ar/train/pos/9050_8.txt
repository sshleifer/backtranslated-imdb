This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that shows. If you are self-programmed to resist "life-proof" stories, just move away and leave the rest of those who still believe in us happy. What makes the cake frost really delicious is that it is based on a true breach of wealth stories, and there is no need to identify the details that have been changed to make a compressed story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and a person with his skills and vision can not succeed in achieving the complex, solid, and intrinsic success of his master father. Simple comments, which refuse to accept the father who tries to put the law all the time, sensing that it may be misplaced, reveal the limit of the commentator, not the book or the actor. This is not ridiculous, or for simple ideas.
