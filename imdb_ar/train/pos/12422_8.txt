With mixed reviews that got this I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very small and entertaining crime film with interesting characters, excellent photos, writing this pompous without being stupid, a good pace. It looks very good, in a funky way. Obviously people like this movie or hate it, and I admire it.
