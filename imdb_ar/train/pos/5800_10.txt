This is by far my favorite film in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 and still enjoy it at 16! It's an absolute masterpiece! No complete video set without it! I enjoy every second of it, and not only the film has some wonderful special effects, but it sends a wonderful message to young people from the audience that may look vulgar but in reality the film is actually very cool! Although Michael Jackson was in some movies now, people still do not see him as a representative. In fact he is the most talented actor I know! He's very talented! It's incredible! MOONWALKER SHOULD SEE !!!!!!
