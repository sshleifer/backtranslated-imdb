The legendary director Sidney Lumette gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense story, which is ultimately shattered by a dysfunctional family as a child. With the A list headed by Philippe Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawk, Marissa Tome and Albert Finney, Lumet has not only included elements of failed crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be confused and confused when creating the plot that Lumet went to here. Instead of showing it in a linear way, he traversed the Tarantino road and shows that the main scene of theft has erred from different points of view. Personally, I found this to be very satisfactory and I was constantly guessing what would happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tommy, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All actors are fully involved in the viewing and it is clear that Lumet enjoys taking out a style he does not usually play. Much of the action and thrill of holding the audience for two hours in a row, it's a rare film that does not pay attention "t disappoints for a moment.
