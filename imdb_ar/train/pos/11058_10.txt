I would like to say that this is the first high quality romantic comedy film I have ever seen. He had depth and although you know from the start who will end up together, there is still longing and expectation. They think they probably will not meet ... it's an independent film. This film was well written, directed and acted. Dancing on the side of the road scene was wonderful.
