After watching Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction do not look too extreme. Maybe according to the current blood and lead standards, this does not seem very motivating, but if you think this was 1972 and that the film contains a really wicked essence, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie did not seem unusual until I reached the scene "Dueling Banjos". In this scene, the brutality and edge of this film are truly visible. When I saw Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) head-to-head with a young boy who seemed to be backward, it really shows how these films can get passion. When you think that the child has a small banjo, he may be able to make it manually, compared to the cute Drew guitar, you really discover how the four men are outside their territory. <br /> <br /> As a conspiracy goes very sensible and never extends beyond its borders. But what really distinguishes this film from four businessmen who get more than what they bargained for on a boat trip is that director John Excalibur breaks all characters away from simple cartoons or stereotypes. So, as the film entered full horror and suspense, I really cared about the four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent all over the world. With Midnight Cowboy, the enemy of the state, and Boogie Nights, the strikers, lead the wonderful crew. John Voight is probably the most difficult thing in this film, and this makes his transformation from man to warrior very reasonable. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character turns out throughout the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good in a very difficult role, coming and raping from Habili, while Rooney Cox plays in a reasonable performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that made these movies really powerful for me is that the bad guys were as terrified as I have ever seen. Bill McKinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and very scary like hills. <br /> <br /> Delivery was generally excellent and I suggest it to anyone, except for people who have poor stomach and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
