For starters, it's a very funny film with some crazy characters revolving around it that would laugh (check out the Russian two blocks). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but this is one of the good things about the movie. The family values ​​and key figures in the film were praised for some development in order to stand against the grasshoppers in the end. He also has two fantastic voices written by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey (of course) ... ... But in fact, the most amazing thing about this film is the animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, brilliant colors, and each ant look different, the backgrounds are beautiful ... and the guys and girls at Pixar have made it look very realistic. All in all, a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin.
