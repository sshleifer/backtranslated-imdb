I enjoyed this movie very much. Many Koreans will feel this film because many of them have teachers when they go to school. The filming was average. The film would have been better had the angel or camera movement been more regular. The editing, however, was very elegant and unusual. <br /> <br /> The acting was also good. Kim Hae Newell usually played an innocent and weak girl in the Korean soap opera. But this time, the girl plays very well. Kwon Sang-woo also plays his part in great faith. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this film is that the passion of characters is not exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic films that cry river characters before the audience, and you always think it was very old. There was no such nonsense in this film. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well.
