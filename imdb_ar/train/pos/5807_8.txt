This, in my opinion, is a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson fans. Contains a message about amazing drugs, special effects and music videos. <br /> <br /> The main movie is centered around the video and music "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four-minute music video, normal speed, in my opinion, is much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> But the plot is rather strange. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster," when he sees a shooting star, turning into an automatic piece. During the film, he turns into a race car, a giant robot, and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a little bit strange. I found it outside the game a bit compared to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> A child was kidnapped, Michael tried to save her, torture him, torture him and suddenly turned him into a giant robot to blow up all the bad guys. A bit weird? Yeah. <br /> <br /> But alongside the strange robot scene, it's a very good movie, and Michael Jackson fans will enjoy both Smooth Criminal and music.
