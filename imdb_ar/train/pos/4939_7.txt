This movie is not great, but it's a good and fun movie. It looks like an indie film made from a play script. Morgan Freeman himself plays mainly, although the director divides that the script was not written for him. There is a small paradox of the actor who goes to the supermarket to conduct a search for a film he has not yet adhered to. I mean he made the film in the end and we see it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue very positive for my taste, but nevertheless, I was refreshed. This film inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which they are walking. There is a lot of focus on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: A beautiful little movie, created within two weeks, with two main actors and a few extras, driven by dialogue, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
