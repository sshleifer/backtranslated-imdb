This movie is very good crackling with tension. The risks are of course great - will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, be arrested, criminals who do not know they are carrying a plague before a large-scale pandemic? But the elements of the smaller plot raise tension in every scene - between Weidemark and the police captain, among the bad guys played by Ballens and Mostel, and between Ballens and a man suffering from plague in death. He is mistakenly thought to be a stalker who was smuggled in some valuable goods, between Widmark and his wife, The basic question is whether a better service is offered to the public by informing them of danger or hiding the situation to avoid widespread panic. The film is beautifully filmed by Kazan, in a very long shot filmed at a new location in New Orleans, ending at an amazing climax, where Palance escapes like rats from his pursuers, across the city's sidewalks and depots. The commentary is wonderful, and perhaps the best I've heard of, it covers cinema, framing and lighting shots, production design, casting nonprofessional actors with small roles, paradoxes and parallels in the plot, such as an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and noir film overall. Watch it once to enjoy the movie alone, and if you're interested in making films, for a second time with a commentary on learning.
