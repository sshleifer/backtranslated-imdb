A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two of the same anti-shop workers (James Stewart and Margaret Solavan) carrying a romantic love story through the mailbox without anyone knowing. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitch keeps any feeling of emotion absent and invites his representatives to make low-quality performances. As a result, she falls in love almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong hidden gloom that passes through this film that he has made. Loneliness is a key theme, clearly represented in the personality of the store owner and manager, and has been beautifully played by Frank Morgan. Discovers that his wife is hiding her, and realizes that the successful life he has made for himself is not enough to prevent him from feeling lonely when he does not have a partner to share. This makes the timid romance between Stuart and Solvan more exciting, because they both communicate with this other unseen, which they both think of as a soulmate before they meet. Of course we know that everything will end in the end, but the film does not allow you to forget the bad feeling of either of them if discovered that the reality did not live up to the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> Lubitch fills his film through a cast of actors with a load of chemistry. The small group of shop staff refer to themselves throughout the film as a small family, and that is exactly what it feels for us too. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and unknown love story. <br /> <br /> Row: A +
