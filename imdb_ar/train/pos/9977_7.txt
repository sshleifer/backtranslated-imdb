The spoilers through: <br /> <br /> I am really a minority in this film but I liked this movie. It's not a classic but definitely involves definitely riding the adrenaline. I certainly thought it deserved at least a 7 rating. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was impressed that I had not seen the original. There is something to tell me that with a film like this, the strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version, therefore, they have little to compare to it. This was not a masterpiece but I entered it a lot and made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were some things I liked. One was molding Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was great and brought a lot of charisma to this role. Since the bulk of the film fell on his shoulders, he needed to be excellent and he was. This was a wonderful role for him. <br /> <br /> There was another interesting thing about Vansishing Point which is that it was made for TV. I had no idea that this was the case when watching it. It certainly looked like a big animation, and I never thought that was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found that the story is very absorbing. I'm not one of the motion movies, but I've absorbed it. Plus it was much more then a motion film where there was drama, mysticism, love story, and strange people in every direction you turned. (I did not even know the priesthood.) That was impressive. This was not a great film but it could be seen. <br /> <br /> Then there is the end. It contains a strong package, and if the person is involved in the story until this stage, it is very difficult not to infringe in the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The implication was that Kowalski survived, and although I am very skeptical of how this happens, he is a film and realism is not always in the mix when making a film. <br /> <br /> So I would say that I found the ending incredibly unrealistic, but very moving in a manipulated way, which I do not usually like, but for some reason, can almost be overlooked in this film. Admittedly, many things were just the foundations of the conspiracy (could the bad guys have returned to stereotyping?) But car makers got a lot of right even if they had a lot of wrong things too. However, having said that, I will admit that I can understand why this person who likes the original dislikes this release because, although I have not seen the original, I have seen many original films that I liked to reproduce with terrible results. (I do not like much in fact sequences). But I can understand the low ratings if the original version is of high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared it to Smoky and Bandit. What about the road version of the "Autumn Legends" meets "Thelma and Louese" too? I certainly felt the touches of both films (both fans). I do not think this is a great movie. It was better then average for me but far from great. But it was a fun and adrenaline-filled movie, touching a great movie of the main character. My VOTE is 7 out of 10.
