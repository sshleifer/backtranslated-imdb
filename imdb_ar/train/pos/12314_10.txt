Once upon a time, a film brings up the tape for every other film of its kind. A movie like this will affect many movies after it's released for years to come. "Chinese Ghost Story" fall into this category. It is one of the best horror films produced during the 1980s. It was probably one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have designed a film that appeals to all lovers of horror. The story is attractive and innovative. The bad guys are threatened and intimidated appropriately. Creepy collections and atmosphere. So that there is little blood and paper to satisfy the home fan sprayer. But do not let the "horror" sign frighten you, if you are not a fan of this genre. This film fits easily with many different categories. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter has combined drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance into a deluxe, deluxe movie pizza. "Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful epic love story recounted, fortunately, without nudity and / or sexually explicit scenes that destroyed many love stories in Hollywood. Those who have been put off by the romantic elements of the story can rest and enjoy the fast-paced sword and Fu Fu. If this is not enough, Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humor to satisfy your appetite for comedy. This movie is something for all film lovers. <br /> <br /> Director Seo Tong Ching and producer Tsui Hark have assembled a truly wonderful team for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a comedian. I can not think of the performance of an artist other than Cheung who could have portrayed Ling Choi Sen better (except perhaps Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is a magician like Lit Su Seen, the enslaved soul that steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title is truly painful and unforgettable. Wu is as hilarious as Taoist villain who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, this film is very impressive, even by today's standards. The direction is fabulous. I hope Hollywood executives today will look for talented artists such as Seo Tung Ching instead of returning to the usual MTV video or Pepsi's commercial directors. Great cinematic photography. You have to pay tribute to any cameraman who can make the film look good when most of its pivotal scenes occur in the dead of night. Special effects make-up first class. In fact, most of the creature's effects in this film blow up the lousy CGI Gulls and Sprites that have become commonplace in modern horror films. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "Chinese Ghost Story" produced two worthy sequel, full length animation film, countless imitation. However, none of the films that followed him or his version have been able to capture the magic of this classic film. This movie is required for any fan of horror or for anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 of 10. <br /> <br />
