This program is a lot of fun and the title song is very attractive and I can not take it out of my head. I find as I get older, I pull into the wrinkles that do things, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. Some of what they do is outrageous but wonderful work considering that now with our computer world, we will not be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from presentations. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and little forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy and ME in a way and Barney Miller in another way, where they interact and interact with each other. They are many, but they do the job, and that is the important thing.
