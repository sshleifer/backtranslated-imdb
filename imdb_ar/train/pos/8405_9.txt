I am proud to say that I have an unclassified version of this choice piece of 70's Crown International cheese on a DVD drive. It's really a flick, which is illogical and fun with a touch of seventeen elegance. It's an attempt to make an honest point about true love and friendship being more important in life than an impressive array of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Sure, it's basically a scandalous portrayal of the adolescent male fantasy - the main character of teen Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, respect his friends, and the chance to show the local bully for racing cars - but it is a very mysterious and well-honed way to hate. Stuart Getz, our innovative protagonist, is the 60's biker, a key role in Getz's passion, a specific cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is just as charming as a pretty blonde babe, and a vile naydertal by Stephan Oliver The Durable Movie The abhorrent is as fascinating as Dogan Hicks' lateral. Danny DeVito is ahead of his stars in particular is an absolute riot like Andy, the owner of an eccentric car wash, Andy, a very lovable gentleman wearing Hawaiian shirts very dreadful and suffering from a severe gambling habit. I particularly like the scene where thugs brutally beat Danny - one holding his arms behind his back while the other man is working on Danny's trunk! Sammy John's theme fluke hit will be a bounce around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a great treat for the wonderful retro-70 style!
