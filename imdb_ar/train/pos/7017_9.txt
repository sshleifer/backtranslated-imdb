Much of this two-hour film is spent asking "What is the story about the leading character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a "Ben Thomas" low-key will keep you guessing. The last 20 to 25 minutes is when you find out, it's shocking ... but you know that something dramatic will be revealed. Until then, Smith, playing it vaguely, almost chases people. You know he has a good reason to do so, but he has never been explained again, to keep guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> All of this, including on / off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") may make some viewers feel frustrated or wanting to finish this movie ..... but no Because the last long part puts all the parts of this puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film rather than the movie Will Weil Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect may be seeing Smith's sad and decrepit face throughout this story. Hardly looks like him in a number of shots. He seems to have lost weight and illness. Smith does a wonderful job portraying a man with a lot of grief. <br /> <br /> As a good movie often does, this movie will make you think long after credits expire.
