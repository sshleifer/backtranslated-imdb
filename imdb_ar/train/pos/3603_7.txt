"Girlfight" is a story coming more than a fight. It is gratifying to have one in an urban school, with Latinos realistic and realistic and reasonable use of the Brooklyn Project settings. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that almost all of Hollywood's high-end movies are located in luxury suburbs or small cities. (Even the fairly "love and basketball" that focused on African-Americans were in the suburbs). While these children share some peer problems themselves, these issues are shrinking compared to other conflicts for these children. High school can be the main achievement of their lives. <br /> <br /> The female element here explodes in its originality, and you hold your breath to see if it can be related - and triumph - to its terms. Much public sympathy goes to the person who is challenged to live up to the expectations of gender bends. <br /> <br /> The film pulls a little here and there, but this is not a cheap thriller "Rocky" fought the film, because the practices and war have complex results, and all relationships - especially with parents and father figures - take center stage over the center ring. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of interesting music stocks listed in the end, but I did not really notice them. <br /> <br /> (Originally written on 7/7/2000)
