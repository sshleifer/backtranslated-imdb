Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars," a new version of Sergio Lyon's "Yojimbo" from Kurosawa (proposed by Red Harvest). <br /> <br /> This movie is a B-movie accurately. Taken this way, it's fairly enjoyable. The crisp trend, full representation of the animal, the limitations of "direct to video" photography handle it well. <br /> <br /> The film's disastrous decision to marry a "fist" '/' yojimbo 'conspiracy to a sub-plot of' once in the West in Lyon '. Although Leon has directed "Fistful" and "West," his motives behind the films are no longer different. "A Man Without a Name" (Eastwood) is a borderline social path with a soft spot for broken families. Chaeles Bronson is obsessed with his broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two people did not have a great relationship with each other. In order to combine them, Gun Crazy has to twist and hold them until we lose the story we are actually following. <br /> <br /> But this B-movie is after all, full of work and ridiculous. It's amusing at this level, just do not expect anything more.
