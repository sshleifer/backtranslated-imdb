Since Douglas MacArthur has brought more human lives - for the better - than any other un-elected president, he deserves a better life story. This is not the "MacArthur" global bad. It is not all that should have been. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the potential existed. From the beginning of the early "Star Trek" episode (1966) to the recent HBO movies "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent appeared as one of the most Films, a man capable of shaping the emotional shadows of his actors, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them. As our producer Frank McCarthy "Patton" (197O), legendary record Jerry Goldsmith both films, Universal has widely promoted the fact that the film was "four years under preparation and production." Despite all this, the film "MacArthur" is quite appropriate and not much more. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942, shortly before a decision was issued by President Franklin D. Kennedy. Roosevelt (Dan O'Reilly) ?? To flee the Philippines to avoid being captured by the Japanese. Thus, this film omits: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 188O in a barracks in Arkansas is still vulnerable to attack by Native American tribesmen? Proving that his wonderful life extended the distance between arches and arrows. To thermal nuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · graduating from West Point ?? First in chapter 95, how did he join his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who was awarded the Order of Honor) at the Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on missions in Japan and China, and more importantly in Philippines; <br /> <br /> · His hero takes advantage of a 1914 voyage to Vera Cruz. <br /> <br /> · How he jumped around the trenches of the First World War like a mountain goat, often injured, and was quickly upgraded blindly to Brigadier; <br /> <br /> · His postwar service as the youngest commander of West Point ?? And more advanced; <br /> <br /> · His participation in the Billy Mitchell military trial in 1924; <br /> <br /> · His defeat in the rewards rallies in 1932; <br /> <br /> · His efforts to preserve On an army with severe funding shortages as Chief of Staff in early 1930; he retired from the US Army to become Marshall (!) In the Philippine Army; <br /> <br /> · Reactivated his commission from Before the FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> All of this has been deleted in favor of long shots from MacArthur as it tries to fight the Sea Turtle while being evacuated by a PT boat ?? , So we know that "General Mac" is a myth, but not the reason; we can not appreciate why the allegations of cheese caused "Dugout Doug" and baseless. <br /> <br /> What remains of his current career is clear and straightforward: his jump on the island 'Hit' em as they are not a "campaign, fulfilling his promise to the Filipinos? "I'll come back!"? His successive achievements, his victory in post-war Japan, and the differing views with President Harry Truman (Ed Edwards Flanders, who are rightfully wrong) about the conduct of the Korean conflict, which led to his open fire. Finally, his declaration to Congress that "old soldiers? Simply fades", and then did so. All of this is historically accurate and is all presented with a deliberate lack of comment. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers are almost painfully distraught by decorating the historical record with their consent or rejection: If MacArthur's actions seem noble, let them do so; if this selfishness or explosive appears, let these concepts be recorded without comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert in handling his audience's reactions skillfully, once again, see "Warm Springs" - it appears that refusing to make this comment is entirely intentional. Historically, this may be commendable, but it almost defeats the viewer's efforts to place this exceptional man in any kind of rational perspective. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a kind of "Made at Cheap" I feel like the movie, as there is "Midway", which was released almost at the same time. Both films were moved to "TV" directors - Sergeant in this case, and Jack Smith on "Midway", both of which have a television appearance. Even Jerry Goldsmith's journey, though fully serviceable, lacks the subtle and great tones of Patton - just another way to commemorate an older man with a very ordinary film. <br /> <br /> There was this vanity and vanity in this man, no doubt. Was there also greatness? Love him or hate him, one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander did before him: he won peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, MacArthur is like a lot of movie biographies, it's a good place to start looking at this wonderful guy, but it's a bad place to end it.
