The erotic cinema was tamed in the 1970s compared to three times a day of the day, which is good. Because there is a good story about naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects that they had in the time period and sex did not hinder the story a bit. In addition, some of the dialects were difficult to understand in time periods, but it is worth watching the uncorrected version and then the modified version of the devil's play. But if you do not care about assigning nude women to dancing and having sex, this is not the right movie for you. However, I enjoyed it and gave it ... 7 Stars.
