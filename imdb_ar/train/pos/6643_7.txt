When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I discovered it was a book, written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I am sure that the film would have been very different from me if I had not read the book. In fact, the book has done a good job of maintaining their fulfillment of the master plan of the book, with slight differences, naturally. I think the thing that disappointed me more than the film was Boyle playing the role of Colonel. I'm not a fan of Boyle, and it seems that no matter the mood during the film, they always try to use their lips filled with eyes, dark eyes and makeup to make themselves look very exciting. In fact, I think the film was true to the real farm of the house. Sheehan's favorite plot was the Sheehan family (a very strange one where the son was killed in Iraq and in the ongoing events there is Casey Sheehan, whose mother went on a grand anti-Iraq speech). In the book, it is clear that the war was not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house occupied the video of the son in the helicopter, you had infiltrated. In general, I was touched by the film, where the book went well.
