It is a beautiful, rich and well executed film with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, he tells how the storyteller needs to find a heir to continue his career, but ends up not getting what he expected in his male-dominated world. The characters must deal with their situation, and the old master must deal with the conflict between his desire to have a companion and heir and his traditional concepts and society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of characters, their lives, their emotions, rich, personal development strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional at all. The film subtly transfers the feelings of the old man and his desire to find an heir, and explains convincingly how he and the child deal with the situation. There is also humor, sometimes very subtle, at the right points. The film also examines the good and culture of traditional Chinese culture, which creates more attention and depth to the film. <br /> <br /> All movies are wonderful, wonderful and wonderful. In addition to other strengths, this creates rich, compelling visual images and compelling real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong sympathy for the characters and their feelings. <br /> <br /> Some have claimed that the film is weakening, but I do not necessarily agree. It may have been stronger by a different end, but any improvement in the overall film would have been fairly small.
