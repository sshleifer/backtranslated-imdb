Red Eye is an exciting film by Freddie Kreuger and Wes Craven. Wes Craven depicts the story of the regular hotel employee Lisa. After attending her grandmother's funeral, she decided to take the red-eye flight. While waiting, this man named Jack Ribner, (how this fffrreeaakkyy?) Met and they became friends. Ironically, they both sit next to each other on this plane. Then this is when horror starts. This movie is exciting and for the people of the weak heart who do not like the thriller / horror films, well let's say that they can pee in their clothes. This is an excellent example of bone-shaking production. Good Craven did well with this film. He chose the right actors, like Rachel Mac Adams, a smart and exciting girl who knows what she does and warns of everything when she acts in a movie. Sealyan Murphy, the terrifying and terrifying actor who can cool your bones in the stunning representation of being a bad character in this film, can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope he will make more films like this.
