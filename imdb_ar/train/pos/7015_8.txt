Ben Thomas (Smith) plays the role of the IRS agent who gives the store practically a surprise to all. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard through the IRS agent, "Hi, I'm from IRS. I'm here to help." Then our smile spreads to a chuckle: "Yes, it's true." <br /> <br /> As you progress further and further in this story, you can not tell this person. It is easy for those who are checked. What is his motive? Is it from another planet, angel, rich man wants to do good? It helps us a lot to be an auditor if we review, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (Kidding, kidding only) <br /> <br /> The film's speed is perfect and the clues that were telling me what was going on were ignored. The focus was intense and the roller was thick on Ben and stayed there. The entire movie works only because of Ben while we try to discover it and I have not seen any evidence (what are the keys that Willis talks about?). Not reading the box before watching a DVD movie was the best way to go here. By the end of the film, all this has finally put together. Well, it was clear by that time. And yes, we ended up, but it's still a wonderful story, mostly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for the Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast was very good as well. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's at the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers, you must realize that the movie message is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need a lot of clues to find out. I did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: No, Sex: Yes, but nothing has to be enthusiastic about him. Cooker. Nudity: No. Language: No.
