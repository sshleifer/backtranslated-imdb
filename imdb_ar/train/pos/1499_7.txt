For lovers of horror-type 1970s hammer, this movie must be fun. The only thing I did not like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was being lost in the worst episode. In general, however, this small solid and scary film. If this is not the best film Amicus, it is certainly one of them. The best episode, properly saved for the latter, is the episode that featured John Pertoy as a horror film actor - it's really wonderful. Well like Pertwee in this role, it is hard to believe that he did not do much of these types of movies. All in all, this is an entertaining movie, and I have been afraid as a child, and it still gives me creeping to this day.
