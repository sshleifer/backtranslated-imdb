The question of whether anyone likes this "The Ghost Train" movie release or not depends on one thing and one thing: your reaction to Arthur Asky's performance. <br /> <br /> The scene tends to be stolen in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you wish to settle down or slightly back down, to allow the many chart characters to appear and develop (which they do to a certain extent). But, in a way, it all points to Askey's Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> I personally love the movie and even love Askey to some extent. It always seems to me that it drowns in my VCR in those individual hours of early morning when I can not sleep and I can not really find the energy needed to watch anything else. There is something about watching old B / W movies in the quiet darkness before dawn which I find attractive ....
