Timothy Heinz's "The Classic War of the Worlds" is a very entertaining film that makes every effort to rewrite the book H. Mr. Heinz succeeds in doing so. I, and those who saw his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard Hollywood pay that could be predicted every year, for example the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise which contained less like the book. Obviously everyone is looking for different things in the film. Those who imagine themselves as "critics" of amateurs are only looking to criticize all they can. Others classify the film on more important grounds, such as entertainment, which is why most people never agree with "critics." We have enjoyed Mr. Hines' effort to be faithful to the classic novel of H.G. Wells, and we found it very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what critics saw as its flaws.
