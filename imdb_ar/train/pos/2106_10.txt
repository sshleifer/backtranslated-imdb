Have you been executed more than a romantic comedy like this one? I never thought of anything ordinary because the simple sale of the music box could leave me in my breath thrilled. Margaret Sullivan makes a great saleswoman, and she and James Stewart stand out best in each other. This sports film is what I think Frank Morgan's most lucrative performance, and with the "Wizard of Oz" and "Turtle Flat" under his belt, is so much. The way he found a partner at Christmas dinner left me feeling dizzy. Director Ernst Lubitch may have thought that "the problem in paradise" is his favorite, but this must be thought of with certainty. With some of the most intelligent dialogue, American films in the 1930s are advancing.
