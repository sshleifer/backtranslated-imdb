This was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performance of the actors was fantastic. I had to think about the film for a very long time. I think every student should watch this film so that they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because it told me how strong love can be. I wanted to be strong as a woman I really liked it because she told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie with Der Untergang, a pianist. If you combine all three movies together, you have a great vision of what happened during the war. You must remember something like war forever.
