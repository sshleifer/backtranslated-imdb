Although Stardust looks like a fantasy film with predictable and average performance, it certainly is not. When I saw the film, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fantasy than an adventure film. She has this magical "halo" from the beginning to the end of the film. The story is well written and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Like every story, it has some morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the wicked brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who succeeds in overcoming every obstacle and difficulty faced during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the shallow and manipulative material girl. <br /> <br /> I have to make additional credits to Claire Dines. It literally shines in this film. Her eyes have this sparkle that perfectly fits her personality. In addition, she and COX have a chemistry that makes romance in the film more prominent. The remaining representatives are famous actors and actors, which of course makes Stardust an interesting and "high quality" film. Overall, the film is wonderful, the magical sites and the plot interesting. I was very disappointed that the film did not receive more awards. I have to give 9/10 stars at least for this purpose.
