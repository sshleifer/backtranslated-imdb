My wife and Kate loved the series completely and I can not wait until the next series (hopefully there will be a supplement!). I like to know what the song is called and it's written, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and I'm still interested in life :-). If anyone has complete words, please send them. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the main reasons behind my wife's love and I love this series is that we are 75 years old and retired but we are still intellectually active. It is wonderful to watch the presentation of the contribution to the community that is still possible to be presented by older people with special skills and experience. The humanitarian aspect that shows the interactions of characters and young people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated, on par with some of our other favorites, "ghosts" and "hustle".
