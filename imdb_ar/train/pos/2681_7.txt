As you already know, Jess Franco is a prolific man. Hess has made hundreds of hundreds of films, many of them nonsense. However, he managed to sneak into good work at times between each exploitation of the assembly line. "Succubus" is not one of his best works (this is either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many of his brands that make it necessary for anyone interested in diving in his big shoulders. It combines sexual excitement (alternating between showing full front lashes and leaving the plowing left to the imagination) and surreal smoothly. It's a dream-like movie, full of wonderful atmosphere. I especially like his constant name. Despite being incredibly unknown, it is amusing to hear all the influences of Franco. <br /> <br /> However, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they came from. The pace is enjoyable, but I can handle it. More problematic is inconsistency. It is clear that the text here was accelerated, and within five minutes of the film I had no idea at all about what was happening (and never met since then). Those who want some content with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if the horror film, it will not really become scary or even suspicious. Still, I have enjoyed all the psychedelic absurdity that I did not really mind these major flaws so much. (7/10)
