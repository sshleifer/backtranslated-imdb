"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a bright jewel under the rubble of Disney movies recently. Parents who have had to sit in the book "The Jungle Book 2" or even Pokemon will certainly appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few films trying to try an original story; previous feature films were just stories from current stories. Movies such as "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." They all do the same thing, but it should be noted that they were all made by Pixar and distributed only by Disney. New Disney movies are released directly into the video, a sequel to a successful movie. The quality of those films is given the path to profitability. A new era began with "Atlantis" followed by "Mulan" and "Lilo & Stitch", most recently "Open Range". The book has created all the lines of the original story rather than fairy tales in the past. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the search for Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including the young Milo Touch, expressed by Michael J. Fox. Melo works at a museum in Washington, D.C. He found a famous archaeologist, dedicated his life to the discovery of Atlantis. This was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wanted Milo not to follow his example. After failing to convince the museum board to sponsor his mission, Milo returns home to find a woman in his dark apartment. She takes it to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. He was a close friend of Milo's grandfather, and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr Whitmore is very rich and paying for the best thing. The crew that will accompany him is the same as his ancestors. The trip is filled with many great obstacles that must be overcome and it is great fun to watch. The viewer finds himself stuck if he reaches Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after discovering Atlantis, not just discovering people. Just keep the interest of the older audience. <br /> <br /> The cartoonists did a great job deep in animation then. The film was a great success in mixing traditional animations with images created by the computer. Achievement is not easily achieved, as most people are quick to notice the difference on both. The characters are reasonably human. There are some nice scenes to chase, with lots of work going on. Some jokes are filled with jokes that children may not get. <br /> <br /> The book's creativity really shines. Atlantis culture has been developed richly, including a complete language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. He explained the disappearance of Atlantis from the world. This magic can already be believed, if by a younger audience. The powers of Atlantis are not presented as magic, but can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although the level of technology used in 1914 is unrealistic. The trip in the submarine reminds us of Nautilus Captain Nemo, with the sub-horns that launch torpedoes. Giant excavators are powered by steam boilers, so try some modern techniques. Women's personalities are empowered in a way that has never been for women, so that they have roles in leadership. This is not a bad thing. It gives a good example for my daughter to look at, rather than cast all the male actors. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons my favorite film on other Disney movies is that there is not one song at all. A tradition that began with the first feature film, "Snow White," and continued until "Lion King," every Disney film is almost full of optimistic songs. This is fantastic and everything, what will the Seven Dwarfs be without "Hi Ho!"? After a million, it would be better without him, but this person avoids the father. Not once does everyone on the screen suddenly know the words to a song unheard of before the song explodes. I am very grateful. <br /> <br /> The story and depth of the animation will certainly keep both parents and children interested. It's a movie I want to see again and again with my children.
