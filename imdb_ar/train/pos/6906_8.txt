I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, silly, and entertaining. I got a wonderful crew and was investigated by some critics for reasons I do not really understand. No, it was not "Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was excellent in playing the role of the "man behind the man". The story is a bit silly certainly, but it is not a high drama, people. I came across a film, perhaps the only good film I got, and then ran into it one night when I was looking for a movie. I never heard that he was supposed to stink even after I saw him, and I'm glad I saw him. In the end I bought the VHS bar on the bargain pile, and I watch it several times a year.
