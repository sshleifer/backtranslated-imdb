I liked this movie, funny and funny. I found this film to be a good family film. The most filthy part of this film was when I referred to New York Yankees. You must be in Red Sox Nation to realize that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to say so to Yankee's fans. I recommend this picture to the entire family. Of course with your love movie / comedy model, the moment in the film,, with me in love and what I do, but the film makes up for it with all the distractions. The film showed some moments how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park Park) how fans felt about 86 years of Sox racing always at the end of the season, how the love of Sox and love with another person go hand in hand.
