There is so much to love in this lovely little comedy. Anyone who has built or bought a house, or even a limited space, will find that there is more than a grain of truth in Mr. Blending's plight. Melvin Douglas, with great comic lighting, tells both and works Blandings' lawyer and voice of reason. Well, Mirna Loy is at her best as a fairly scattered but very sick wife. But the best performance is a grant. He is the American man, especially relevant at the time of the film's release, when the nation was in the grip of housing shortages after the end of the war. Universal themes, lack of funds, work pressure, fear of infidelity. Yes, it ends horribly, but keep in mind that this was a time when the world was recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. This is still relevant today, and I have to record the bad reviews I see as a current preference for stupid comedy. The appearance of the film is wonderful, and there are some wonderful parts of the comedy well, especially with the beginning. While it has lost some of its social significance, almost sixty years after its publication, is still a jewel.
