But this is hilarious, at least if you grew up on Al Ghorba, as I did. It is a mockery of his life and career, ranging from superstars to a return to tracing. It is uneven in some places, but some sections are still very funny, especially when going to Japan. Although she is not quite as affectionate as Lost in Translation, and does not find love no matter how fleeting, he picks up in a bottle a collection of completely alien cultural features namely Tokyo Street Life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the eccentric is not recognized as an insightful cultural commentator who is; perhaps a rose of any other name is a completely sweet scent. Still, this is a funny film.
