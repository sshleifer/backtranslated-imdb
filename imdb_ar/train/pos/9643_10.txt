This movie has everything. Passion, Power, Love, and Wonderful Beach Dance by Stefan Redo ... It reveals the need for genuine inner company and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple, they do not mean that there is no very useful idea for anyone inside. I would probably rate it as a gay film, but a film can be appreciated and loved by people of different sexes as well as gay and bisexual. Mathieu's inability to deal with his emotions reveals the way in which our society does not encourage us to behave differently, and this is what creates the difference between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see!
