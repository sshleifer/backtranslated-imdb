You were not sure what to expect from this film due to its wonderful collection of stars and directors, but in the end you did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the last episode with the American tourist speaking a horrible French accent (which made me feel better about me) which was actually very impressive and a great way to finish the film. <br /> <br /> The story of the medic and victim of the stab was also moving and a pure comedy takes Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi the prize. The Tom Tykwer section was impressive, though ambitious in its scope. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins clip was quite exciting and the vampire story was completely comic. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section was also very tired, and the Chinatown story was not fully understood. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is worth watching good movies and has a strong end. It is not so painful to sit in bad sections - they last only 5 minutes anyway. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
