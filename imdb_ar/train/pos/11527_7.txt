Miriam Hopkins is the "Redheaded Lady" in this 1940 biography of Lady Leslie Carter, who starred with Claude Raines as David Belasco, Richard Inley as Le Pine and a host of supporting players, including Laura Hope Cross and Victor Gore. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Raines offer great performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who made us feel like Carter. Rain is as great as producer / writer / actor / actor David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Le Bain, served as a consultant in this film. It is a poor representation of the real events in Mrs. Carter's life. True, there was a lot of bitter and bitter divorce, and was undoubtedly seen as a blatant character of that and to become an actress. However, she was custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle. Once she separated from Belasco, she no longer had, in fact, started working in Vaudeville and had already produced some films near the end of her life. She has already married Le, and has become a leading man in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force of Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is the restoration of her son's custody, but she finally realized that at the time away from him, he was completely connected with his father. In the film too (and I'm not sure if this is true in real life) I traveled with her mother and lived in an indoor theater house, which gives the film some interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> No bad film, perhaps not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in the heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with a six-foot hairline. Outside the theater, fans blew her hair, hanging at a height of 35 feet above the stage, holding the bell center to prevent it from ringing. Completely visual.
