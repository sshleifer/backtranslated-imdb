Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is often remembered for being nominated for an Oscar for eleven and won the Oscars. More troubling is that Spielberg himself did not run for the best director. Needless to say, directors deserve more praise than they have. <br /> <br /> The story relates to the experiences and trials of Sealy Johnson (Wobi Goldberg), an African American woman who is initially dominated by incest. Father then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Sealy's relationships with the women around her. I have been told from a female perspective quite a bit, but there is no need to fear that this is a "flick" of saccharin. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes enthusiastic, although central personality conflicts are of paramount importance. Some may not appreciate the change in tone at the end of the film, but I did not mind even though the similar content in a less film might make me more likely to roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three nominations for Oscars for acting: Wobe Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey certainly deserve it, and Danny Glover was unjustly cruel. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, Spielberg did not receive the Best Director award for his efforts. Such neglect of beggars, because the direction of Spielberg here is first class. I'm not particularly crazy about the Quincy Jones score, but it's by no means average. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is satisfactory, well narrated by a major filmmaker working from Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Try the experiment, and it will probably be puzzling for me about how to handle it very badly at Oscar Night.
