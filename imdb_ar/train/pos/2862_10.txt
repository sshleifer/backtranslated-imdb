My comment is limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This wonderful series was one of the first television series, and it had a big impact in convincing Americans that they should buy a color television set, which was about $ 800 in 1959, equivalent to more than $ 3,000 today. How much of this will be paid for the privilege of viewing a program being sent by a cathode beam image tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when I started the series, and I saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I saw her now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First, many lines of the story include the Comstock Lode and the Silver Mining Period, dating from 1859. For 1859, arms and clothing, for the most part, are not authentic. (I left the haircuts out of the discussion.) This is essentially a netbook. <br /> <br /> It was impossible for Ben to reach Lake Tahoe in 1839 and to have collected 100 square mile farms in the next 20 years. Pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada in late 1847, and Gold Rush did not start until two years later. <br /> <br /> The Indians did not play with Native American actors. John Ford used Native American actors in his twenties. Bonanza producers did so easily after thirty years. This is a big problem for me. <br /> <br /> There are other timeline problems. In the first season, Mark Twain appears, portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also oscillated between 1859-1860 (pre-Civil War) and what was more suited to the 1880 timeframe. There were problems of continuity, over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat inappropriate that there is a lot of killing in the first season. Over time, killing has been reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take a liberal social orientation, which will be hard to believe, given the time limit, but the book gives credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes that began in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the behavior is good, and I have come to the conclusion in my last years that Adam's personality has been drawn from other personalities. I do not think that Bernell Roberts got the credit he deserves. Also, the first season reinforces the fact that Dan Block (HBS) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories follow true historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was a wonderful family entertainment, and the series stands very well on any scale.
