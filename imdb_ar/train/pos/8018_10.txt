In this film Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are university graduates who decided to bring their successful college students, Manhattan Melodies, to Broadway. Unfortunately, no product will meet with puppets. After being rejected by many producers, Scooter suggests that Muppets decide to proceed alone. Still, Kermit still believes he can make his offer on Broadway, but after finally doing so, let everyone know he sold the show. Kermit has lost memory and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> This includes many wonderful scenes, including a series of live events that provided Muppet Babies, a full-length wedding sequence, including Sesame Street cast, Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter For film theater, scenery where Rizo and other mice cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that no more characters are included. Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this film as it was in the Muppet Show The latter should have been with The Great Muppet Caper and Miss Missgygy Foo Foo (after all, Ritzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, was a big part of this film, and was not known at the time).
