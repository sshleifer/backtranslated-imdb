I must say, this film has given me a double character. I was told over and over that I would close and start talking as a normal person. But, very hard ... not Wang is not. Have you found this disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get a much more temperament. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show your fans, but you have to show it to a teenager or immature person in your workplace. Anyway, return to sound behaviors. Fortunately, this site contains some "ladies man" (did anyone in the studio notice that it should be an apostrophe (?) Between e and s?) So you can always get something good to tell your boss or the police. I have a sheet in my wallet.
