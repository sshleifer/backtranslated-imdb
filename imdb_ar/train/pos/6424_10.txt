As a child, I remember being nine or ten years old and I loved this film. It was a motion picture / comedy Bollywood. It is a tradition of Bad Boys! The identities of the whole swap, but the arrival of two other twins all aim from the window and then the arrival of the colored bad guys who dance and sing! The motion scenes in the film are not revolutionary but they are still spectacular scenes. The film was really funny and had a brilliant return needed by Amitabh Bashan. Govinda Jewel As always, this may be his best work yet, shines while the side kick offers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Songs .... Funny and attractive songs both .............. Proof laugh when you do not expect it ... Amitabh Bashan Surprisingly it's very funny Make you laugh as "Bade Miah" .... his accent ... body language ..... wonderful ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki naab re daal" is the best song ...... ........ Farhan.
