This was undoubtedly the best in the series "Dirty Harry". From the opening credits, she was swept into a story of revenge that hits hard and deeply draws. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a shocked woman for revenge. Eastwood has many "side" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but Harry shows him at his best. This film is loaded with memorable characters in simple roles, and must be a standard for detective / excitement clicks. This one is Harry Dirty Dust and this is raw and free of any "fluff". I can watch this over and over (well, not in one session) because it is spinning "out for revenge." The pace is fast and many scenes are memorable. "Go ahead - make my day ... you feel lucky, Punk? ...." A classic of Eastwood just like Eastwood, with his expressive rubbery, whispering, threatening voice can do it.
