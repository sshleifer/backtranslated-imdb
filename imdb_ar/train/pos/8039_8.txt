Sniper gives a real new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, lots of fire, everyone dying, Bam Bam. "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly conveys all the feelings it is aiming at - the inability of humans in the jungle, the ultimate hatred and trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger. A low-budget film seems to make up for every flaw in motion, thrill and excitement, because when it comes to it, it's just one shot and one shot.
