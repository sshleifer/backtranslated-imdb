This is an animated CGI movie based on the 2D French animation series. The series ran briefly on the Cartoon Network, but its show was so short that its inclusion as a potential Oscar nominee for this year's best animated film left most of the people I know going to "Huh?" This is the story of Lian Chu, the gentle heart muscle, and the brainchild of Joseph, who, like Hector, looks like a dragon. Travel around the world offering their services as dragon hunters but never get paid. In their lives, Zoe, the loving niece of the king who is blind, comes. It seems that the world may be eaten by a huge monster and all the knights who were sent by the king never came back or if they actually returned, they returned ashes. In desperation the king hires dragon hunters to stop the eating world. Zoe of course labels ... <br /> <br /> What can I say then why some people are hiding this movie under a rock? It's a really good movie that is quite far from the radar except for Oscar's potential rival. It's a beautifully designed film (the world that happens in it contains floating land and crazy creatures) that constantly pushed me to "Wow." The Voice in Voice with Forrest Whitaker in the role of Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I have ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is top notch. Equally, the script does not speak to its audience, using some real expressions that are not usually heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). Everything is really good. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits last for a long time, but at the same time, be amusing. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it. It's one of the best animated films of 2008 and it's listed as a nice surprise list for 2009.
