Why on earth should you explore the wonderful documentary nature of "Earth"? How long do you have on Earth so I can explain this to you? Well, I will not extend my exploratory exploration to Earth indefinitely, but I have to stand up to why this is what I should see. The documentary takes a round trip on the migratory paths of three animal families: a polar bears and saturation with a real sub-plot of the father dares to search for food on his way off, a mama of the whale with her baby whale takes a whale on a migration tour of the prey, Perhaps not small, it is elephants) migrates in Africa. Alistair Furthahl and Mark Linfield made "Out of the Earth" capturing the survival skills of many other animal species as well as the magnetic shots of our three animal heroes. Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Raftsch and Andrew Schillaber were cinematographers of animals in the camera, portraying the wonderful nature and instinctive behaviors of animals; and the prey of the animals was not useful. "Earth" is also studied in the effect of global warming on animals; polar bear Papa in the document is a boy animal poster on that result. Sons of the Earth, it is time to make a documentary trip to visit Earth today! **** Hassan
