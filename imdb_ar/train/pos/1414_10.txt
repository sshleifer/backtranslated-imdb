First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this long documentary. It should be properly referred to as: "Earth, 2009". Second, allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the 2006 Planet Earth television series. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but I have learned here that this is the full movie version of this 2006 TV series. I judge any film based on its merits, not by its source. Judged the results, on their own, the results of "Earth, 2009" already excellent. I dismiss this frivolous complaint from some reviewers: it is just an expanded version of the 2006 "Planet Earth" television series. So what? It does not really matter. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker and watched dozens of natural documentaries in my life, I was amazed and impressed by Earth, 2009. This is the first film from the new DisneyNature section of Disney and follows Walt Disney's leading films and Oscar-winning natural documentaries in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinema, movie editing, music score, sound and combo are all excellent. There were a few other documentaries that were also featured in these categories. What really distinguishes "Earth, 2009" is far from its scope. It covers the entire planet literally, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After seeing the first, it was clear that this documentary requires a tremendous effort and a great deal of time and talent to create it. <br /> <br /> Three production companies have been asked to produce this stunning documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the story of four types of their great migrations, one span of seasons beginning in January and ending in December from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new hi-tech cameras have been used in this film: one camera with a 360-degree computer-controlled rotation and the other a high resolution camera set at 1,000 frames per second. The imaging technology added drama and beauty to some of Earth Earth's 2009 scenes, particularly the hunt for leopards and great white sharks that jumped from the sea to catch the sea black and an aerial view over the edge of the highest waterfall in the world. There are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through cinematic photography, music scores and comedies, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. Thanks to the wonderful music of Berliner Philharmoniker, creative and creative cinematography and James Earl Jones, Earth, 2009 was the greatest ever nature documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have really worked well here. This film should be seen in all schools around the world. I expect the Academy Award for Best Documentary, among other awards. Really, the documentary is stunning, stunning, delightful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
