Dumbland is not for everyone. Actually Dumbland is probably no one except Lynch and that's what makes it funny and collective caricature. violent? Yes really. swearing? Yes really. silly? Yes really. A piece of garbage? Start. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no brains and beat the wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1 - My teeth are bleeding, all the surrounding noise and violence make me want to scream and put me behind my bed. Get the Stick! Yes, I bring it and learn the lesson: Some people will never be thankful for your actions. 3- Ants. More Lynch ring of everything, music, surrealism and very sweet revenge ...
