Kali's Tears are an original horror film that explores the actions of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned how to control their will and bodies so that they can "cure" others with radical techniques (which can lead to nightmares, physical pain and torture) ) To release the pent-up demons inside. <br /> <br /> The film appears as a series of short essays about the Taylor-Ericsson group - the cult collection mentioned above. The first part is somewhat slower than the rest but it serves well to prepare the premise for the rest of the film. The rest of it is shown as a mindf @ ck with some basic nutrients thrown in the mix (full front lobe and others) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> Say I see this. It may not be amazing, but it is a wonderful and elegant concept in the right places. 10/08.
