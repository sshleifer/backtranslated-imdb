Father and son communicate very little. In fact they speak different languages. But when his father leads his father 3,000 miles to Mecca, the talks finally take place. They are difficult and growth is necessary in both parts. <br /> <br /> This movie takes us into the hearts of these travelers, and it is actually a great journey for the public as well as for school principals. The images are impressive throughout, especially the final scenes in Mecca. It assures me again how different the world is, but at the same time, how similar it is. The same applies to father and son in this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You'll be glad you did.
