Breaking Glass is a movie that must be seen by everyone who aspires to be in the music industry more than once. It's a very dark story about how the record company works with a singer to do things on her way and earn as much money as possible. When looking at some of the "star search" television programs today in both the UK and abroad, I always mention this film. Although he is not an expert on the subject, the winners in these presentations tend to have a very big initial success and then drop from there. This film precedes these performances although the effect seems to be the same. After getting rid of her manager, Phil Daniels played brilliantly, slowly but surely the registrar changed her words and made them doping, and in the end it was completely burned. You are the potential stars tomorrow .... Watch this and beware !!!
