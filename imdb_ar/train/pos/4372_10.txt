Rob Rui is an epic of passion and action! Liam Neeson offers a great show like Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lang is perfect for letters such as his wife Mary. She has the most passion and chemistry that I've seen in a couple of screen. John Hurt offers him the best aristocratic performance wrong. Tim Roth portrays one of the great screen villains. The rape of Mary is abhorrent and exhausting. It's really a wonderful bastard in this film. The last duel between Rob and Cingham is one of the best swordsmen ever. Record the script answer, and the direction of Michael Katon Jones is flawless. 10 out of 10.
