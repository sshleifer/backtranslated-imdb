I saw this movie last night at a special movie theater showing in NÃ¼rnberg and it was wonderful. I have to admit that the original composition of the cello operator and the rhythm / xylophone operator influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself was also powerful in its depiction of the tragic epic of Neibelungen. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in silent movies or in Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this movie. The costumes were wonderful and innovative, the collections were luxurious and quaint, and the representation was dramatic and exciting (as usual in the silent "tragedies"). Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this duo film that concerns Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after the death of Siegfried, when Krimeld (Gudrun in the Scandinavian versions of the story) began planning revenge for her brothers. <br /> <br /> Also, I watched this movie in German; I am a native English speaker and I have a basic German knowledge. It was hard to read subtitles (what do you call them in silent movies?) Initially because of the old German text, so I recommend that you see in German that you are sure you can distinguish between "k", "f" and "s" in the old text. :)
