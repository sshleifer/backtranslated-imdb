A short subject about SHIRELE TEMPLE story. <br /> <br /> At the Buttermilk Pete's Cafe, local barreled events of WAR BABIES can become tough at the midday break. <br /> <br /> This primitive little movie - a parody of military films - offers some laughs, but a few other things: small totes that speak strongly can fade in a short time. Shirley Temple, who plays a French double-rocked queen, did not have much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlights: Real signs of children's mood when a few children recover unexpectedly and are really soaked with milk. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, the short and second themes were useful for studios as important training grounds for new or thriving talent, either in front of or behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short theme were quite different from the dynamics of a feature film, which is like writing a short story rather than a novel. The short subjects were produced economically in terms of both budget and schedule and were able to depict a wide range of materials, perfect complement to studio films.
