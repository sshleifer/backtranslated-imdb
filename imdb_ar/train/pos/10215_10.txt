It seems that most of the people who chase the films that show Audrey Tutu do not understand that Emily was a character - she is not really the real character of Audrey Tutu, so every film she participates in will not be part of Amelie, Part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now with this saying, I also took this movie because Audrey was in it. Yes, that's right, there's a big gap after the first scene, which was never seen for 45 minutes, but I did not miss it because I enjoyed the other characters very much. The guy who lies around everything is very funny, the guy who justifies the people who ran out of the cafe and skips the bill by finding coupons and the loss balance, actually .... Entering all the characters here can take some time but this is one of the best movies I have seen since interval. <br /> <br /> The character of Erie Audrey Tutu is not the sweet girl Amily has overcome. In fact, like Erin, I was struck by her own brazen desire for change. In this film, Irene is a girl of good intentions, but over a day (very terrible), her actions become more sad and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie absolutely wonderful is you make all these stories and graphics really interesting ... very entertaining to watch, wonderful landscapes and stills, very colorful and very slow, and all characters can actually act. The best part of the film comes with about 20 minutes left .... This is the time when all the conspiracies begin to tangle together and the ride really moves and connects everything together and becomes logical, and the whole butterfly blossoms. I swear, I've had the best 20 minutes of the movie I've seen in a while, and the end .... It has made me think "damn it I've had luck finding this movie." The end of this film is first class. Each of the scriptwriters of this is great, because not only all these other sub-points are going on, but also to make them all knit together (and in a reasonable way, this is the case here) but also to make every character feel human and not alive, The stylized characters that were used as a ketchup to build this full effect of the butterfly ... are very impressive. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest this movie because it is a wonderful movie to watch it at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
