Yes, this budget film is very low. Thus, the representation has not won a prize, and sometimes the work is slow because filmmakers are releasing longer sequences rather than millions of instances that are later released in a film. This film compensates for a prominent text that takes vampires seriously and explains it and develops a whole plot of it. Apart from the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetics, law enforcement, law enforcement, martial arts, philosophical meditations, and some good metal music. Glory goes to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / lead actor. Outside of me how can this man accomplish all these roles and do well. I think I appreciate this film. You have to be familiar with all kinds of subjects to see that the author has done a lot of research and knows all these things. There are some wonderful works of the camera, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something I've never seen before, but it praises the zombie underwater attack at Zombi Folsi. The casting process is good, as the erotic female is already exciting. The main vampire also seems perfect for the role. The female victim looks weak. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror scare, there should have been more nudity. If you want to watch an original vampire movie with a wonderful story, this flick is for you. I look forward to seeing Mr. O'Leary's future projects.
