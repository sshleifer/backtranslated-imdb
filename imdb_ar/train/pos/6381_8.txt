"Atlantis" is a new and appropriate step for the Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film from this mysterious legend like Atlantis. I did not have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, I do not quite understand why this film has very poor ratings. Even in my country, the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not an ideal film, but it is still one of the greatest Disney movies, so I doubt that this film will get the reputation of "Disney Classic". Well, this is another case. It's funny to imagine that this science fiction movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trussdale try to stay away from their brutal reputation for movies, he, I, m just kidding). <br /> <br /> Well, that's enough bullshit. "Atlantis" is a wonderful, fun and very enjoyable movie. Even this film is a PG motion film, and it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, do not kill me because of his writing, he). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not destroy the film. Animation inspired by the comic book is suitable for the film and emerges from the usual Disney style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequence is impressive. The film is funny sometimes, so I laugh more than laugh through the film. (Spoilers) The characters of this film are very popular, but unfortunately, there is not enough time for the screen to get to know everyone, so leave some characters behind them (spoilers). <br /> <br /> The result of James Newton Howard is very cool. It's bold and weird. (SPOILER) The most impressive about this film is how they make the Atlantic language look very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really cool (more spoilers) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. But fortunately, there are not many of them. <br /> <br /> Are you a favorite, do not listen to reviewers and see "Atlantis", because it's waiting for you ...
