As Dr. Alan Winston, Corbin Berenson turns a great show in The Dentist. <br /> <br /> Given his already vexing tendencies in high gear, followed by the US Tax Administration and his very suspicious wife; Dr. Alan Winston loses his mind more and more every day. <br /> <br /> When Doc realizes that his wife is having a relationship with a local billiards boy, this triggers a series of events that lead to torture, murder and total anarchy of ants! "Dentist" is a powerful film! He makes Dr. Feinston's character both hateful and connected. Although it is completely out of pumpkin, the public will still feel sympathy for it. That my friends ..... are acting damn well. <br /> <br /> Good actors cast good support from the Permanent Representatives on the essence of this film. It will keep you in perfect mastery for fun, good killing, humor and effective effectiveness throughout the movie playback period. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend!
