Tess of the Storm Country was Mary Beckford's car that I was going to get for a while. I finally found the VHS version at a reasonable price and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her a typical, courageous, exciting and innocent image of a girl on the wrong path side that wins the heart of the wealthy heir. Only this time, the risks are greater: false charges of murder, illegitimate child (and subsequent misplaced motherhood) and suicide. <br /> <br /> One can see why Beckford wanted to recreate this. The story is a true moral story of the kind that she would like to play in. Controversial topics are not always clearly articulated; the viewer must draw attention and pick up hints to catch all that is implied at the first viewing? Although everything is explained in one way or another in the end. <br /> <br /> The only negative note I can make will be related to Jan Hirschault and the dog. Herschel, who looks like his character, Ben Leats, is about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Being sent to escape panic when he directs the 60-pound chocolate lab in his direction! Then, to fix it (or perhaps to justify the dog's puzzling fear), he is able to install it on the ground and somehow harm him so that he is still struggling to rise later, hitting a bad storm! This is the same beloved lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles with Mary! After Mary later dumped boiling water in the face of Ben, which hardly slows down! Well, I've ventured about Ben and the Chocolate Lab! Otherwise, the film was very moving and certainly caught my eye. Beckford's support was strong and strong. This is definitely among her best films.
