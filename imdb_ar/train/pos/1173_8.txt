"Night of the Living Homeless" was a fairly strong end for the first half of Season 11. It is clearly a parody of the various zombies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, which corresponds to the homeless with the living dead, as creatures that thrive on the change Vacuum instead of brains. <br /> <br /> Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outburst of homeless people when, given the goodness of his heart, he gives $ 20 to a homeless man in front of him. More displaced people begin to sneak into South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very powerful episode of Randy Marsh, where he plays the role of the commander who carries firearms to adults who turn to the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy arrives at the center of society, hundreds of homeless people accuse him of shouting "I have no change!" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Proplowsky to the homeless, when he tries to escape by riding a bus outside the city, and accidentally tossing any change for the bus to distract the displaced. Then one becomes, and everyone is asked to change. <br /> <br /> The boys are trying to find out why so many homeless people are in South Park and find a man who is director of homeless studies. They discovered that the nearby town of Evergreen had a similar problem with the displaced, so they fled to Evergreen to find out what they had done to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house and try to get out easily by shooting himself. However, he has failed several times, because he shoots himself in the jaw, eye, chest, neck and shoulder, screaming horribly until his death. Perhaps it would have been more fun if nothing similar had happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> At the same time, one refugee discovers that due to the problem of displaced persons, the value of the property has been reduced and therefore the bank has been locked into his home, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on the gun on the man's head. When the man finally pleads for a few dollars to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, the boys discovered that the citizens of the city sent the homeless to South Park, and that the death of the homeless from one city to another took place all over the country. The boys adjust the bus that drives the homeless out of South Park and take them all the way to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The zombie film and the great lines of Randy Marsh are certainly equal to this. 10/08
