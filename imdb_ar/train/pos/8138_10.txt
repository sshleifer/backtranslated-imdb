CB4 was bad, but he probably gave Cond√©v the idea better. Spinal Tap is more like anything else, the movie is intelligent from the start. Surprisingly anyone saw him again in the mid-1990s. The performances were played for laughter but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, like Marx's brothers. These guys are real and a little varied. They react to situations like any of us. Well, we may not take a tantrum when our late performance hats bother us, or pull out guns and beat an exec, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (with) H (hats) Take themselves seriously enough to kick you, then you're hooked. Rent it or get it at any price, even if you are not really in rap, this will keep you out loud. Comparing this to CB4 is similar to comparing Star Wars to George Lucas with Gillards Bock Rogers, I think you see my point
