Nina Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ross" in the 1945 film Noir, starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. The film is short and it suffers. It could have been longer than fifteen minutes to half an hour. <br /> <br /> When I was older, Fuchs was a fixture on television, playing a nervous woman, wife with a deceptive husband, nervous wreckage. She became one of the greatest acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she is a pretty young girl playing a starring role. Julia answers one of the ads for a secretary and is immediately appointed by Ms. Hughes and her son Ralph. She knows little - although we know immediately - that the recruitment agent is an interface set up to get the right woman for the job, a woman without a family and no boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It is a life in the situation; once Julia arrives at the house, anesthetizes her, and when she wakes up, she is told that she is Mrs. Hughes and is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Budget is low but still amusing - some things happen, especially in the end, in a very fast way, so I said the film is very short. However, I recommend it.
