I'm bigger than to know (or care) exactly the difference between rap and hip hop. Being a Canadian, I probably never saw MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this movie was very fun when I saw it, a small bright spelling. Hip-hop culture is so prevalent these days that it's hard not to listen to it again and again. (If we can say the same thing about the music of the domes.) I got most jokes (at least I think I did). It is certainly derived from the Spinal Tap, but there are a lot of goals that can stand in front of a tap treatment. Not only carpenters, they are sacred.
