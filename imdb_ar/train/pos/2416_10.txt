Yes, it's a fucking film, so if you're looking for performance from the Oscars, forget this movie ... but if you like John Kandy's humor, that's a must. We lost John Candy before he made enough of his brilliant comedy brand, which is better only in one film: airplanes, trains, and cars (with Steve Martin). Excellent support performance for Eugene Levy, probably his best ever works like the hot-headed Sal DiPasquale. Good representation is also Richard Libertini, Mills Lane and Pat Hengel. You should see this mysterious and unprintable movie if you're a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
