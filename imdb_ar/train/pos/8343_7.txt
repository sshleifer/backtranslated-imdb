Australian Fred Chibesi (Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is enjoyable, relaxing, and located in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Walters is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, with the help of Albert Einstein, Grumpy Old Men and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them their shoes are preppie. Meg Ryan (sleepless in Seattle, got mail) is Katharine Boyd, Einstein's niece, a math specialist, but she is not sure. Perhaps that is because it is surrounded by all that genius. She believes that if she marries a person of high quality, her children will get a high degree of quality as well, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins' nice smile and Meg's appeal, it's a refreshing film. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Katherine is engaged to jerk James Morland, who acts in animal behavior, but is very claustrophobic. This is the love of putting the first glance at the position, between a mechanic and a mathematician. Witty lines and camouflage lines! The cinema is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in spring. With great help from all these wonderful men, Catherine drops to Ed, unaware that he is a car mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite scenes: Ed took a multi-choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt, and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride the motorcycle. Nathan and Kurt and Boris leave all search animals free! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotations: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your mind interfere with your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo ""? Katherine Boyd: "Well I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing film, I recommend it. I have the tape every time and I will see it again.
