This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best dramas ever produced here ... for my money anywhere. It is hard and courageous, the characters are real, the attitudes are believable and not ashamed of the dark side of life that every day police officers, criminals, victims, lawyers and other people face in their various orbits. <br /> <br /> This offer lasted for two seasons and was stopped because the offer was not sold well abroad. We are all sorry for its loss: however, like the Fulti Towers, we will be able to venerate this as a series of limited length and uniformly high quality.
