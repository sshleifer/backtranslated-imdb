Engage drama for four men on weekends in kayaking in a remote river. They are the peace advocate (John Voight), the adventurer, the violent Louis (Bert Reynolds), the obnoxious Bobby (Ned Betty) and the beautiful guy Drew (Rooney Cox). The first 40 fantastic minutes - there is the stunning Panjos Swordsman sequence, the interesting interaction between the characters and the stunning cinematography of the film on a wide screen by Filmos Zigmond. Then attack two hillbillies Ed and Bobby. One of them is robbing Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The scene is unbelievably beautiful but this terrible violence is happening. To be honest, the rape of my house has never bothered me - I am fully aware that it is fake despite good conduct. This film also shows how the characters change - Ed has experienced his peace, Lewis has become weak, Bobby has been beaten by someone he has ridiculed before, and Drew is trying to keep himself rational. John Boorman's output is also very contentious, and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood tremendously. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Voight is just OK in the lead - it was better. Beatty is also fine - but he is his first film and he has the courage to perform this risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start to collapse. The wonderful Reynolds - one of his best acting at all! How did not this even nominate the Academy Award to run me away. Bill McKinney and Herbert Caward are as hard to believe as the hills. <br /> <br /> A powerful film - not for children. Try to see an unbroken version - the TV version has been disconnected. The presentation packed with messages is also essential for capturing stunning images.
