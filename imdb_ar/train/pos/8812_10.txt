I saw this series when it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two men met and told a filmmaker from each country to make a film about 911. These directors never met until the project was completed and saw how it looked together. Warning: spoilers are waiting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong, some of them controversial. If you are an American, you may not like it because some pieces may be anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who enjoyed this series. The piece that I found the best was from India. Was about how a Muslim family, living in the United States, gave birth to two children, one of whom was missing. The Americans gave them cold shoulder and automatically assumed it was linked to terrorist bombing. It embodies the mother's desperation and insulting these accusations well, so that tears brought to my eyes. In the end we see that her son died while trying to rescue many victims from the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that's what made it real. There was a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humorous but with the same power as others. Must see for all, hope that America will solve this, let it play in their own country.
