First of all, this movie was not shown on the theaters (tested according to what they say), and I say they figured out the twisted police story, the politicians and the people of the dedicated newspapers who were done to death, just send it to DVD and cable TV> Money and running. <br /> <br /> It is said that I usually like this type of film, especially with this named actor. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard & onaff distaff, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and the story were accomplished to death, but the above-mentioned crew brings life to this violent film, which is actually viewable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is as good as a young reporter dedicated to a Morgan Freeman newspaper, the others are crooked policemen, politicians or fairly respectable men, the girl friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and doing what is needed, It is quite violent, many murders, etc., not for children. No way is a wonderful movie, but for what it is and the crew is certainly good, <br /> <br /> *** ratings (of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10 )
