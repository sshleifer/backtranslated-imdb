So we risk. This was a fairly charming film, I loved the direction of art (I felt it "real" more than most children's films), and the costumes were not very impressive. The child actors were not bad at watching them (the adult shows were going cheesy). It was wonderful to show how a frightened child intimidates others as well as children who stand up to bullying. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults want to see this for themselves, but it is a wonderful movie to take a child to. Since the "courtyard" was apparently attended by more than 100 children at the same time, I was really pleased that we chose the "Worms" show which is a little bit instead.
