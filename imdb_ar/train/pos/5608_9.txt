It certainly became unstable soon after this film, but from "Knife In the Water" to "The Tenant", Roman Polanski could always rely on it to deliver something unique and wonderful. Despite many ongoing themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really similar. The story of this is somewhat similar to its "stalemate" ten years ago, but the tone is quite different. The "tenant" managed to balance darker darkness (I am a little reluctant to call it humor, although the behavior of the strange heroes and dialogue was sometimes funny) with some really suspicious paranoia. Polanski was always a professor of uneasiness, and the moments of this film were unbearably creepy. The general peculiarity of the film is also an added advantage. <br /> <br /> In addition to the brilliant Polanski group as usual, the rest of the cast and crew make great contributions. Polanski often overshadows Polanski, but his performance here embodies his characters in embarrassment and a feeling of being outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this film more than a surprise to be a stranger. The rest of the actors are also making strong performances, especially the sympathetic role of Isabelle Adjani, the ill-fated Melville Douglas and Shelley Winters. The "lessee" is often underestimated by the willingness of people to praise praise for both "expulsion" and "Rosemary child," but as wonderful as any of those classics. (9/10)
