The masterpiece is very impressive, not only for the basic themes of the story, but also for the wonderful and fascinating works of Angelopoulos in the field of images, not to mention the representation of the Giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the play of eminent personalities by Ilias Logothetis. Gregory Carr's performance may seem obscured by his "hardcore" partners in the first position, but in fact he plays his character completely, which is revealed in his final scene with the girl (Khreseco) and the man (Mastroiani), although a foregone conclusion. (Hence the spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Get your expectations straight! It is a "technical film" in every sense of the word that this phrase must provide and requires attention. Not for leisure, but to watch a work of art with the necessary emphasis as in reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the general style of photography, large screen display is recommended. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. But the film includes - in addition to the Greek and English speaking parts - spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will appeal to those who are enchanted by the beauty of hearing different languages.
