At first glance, I was expecting this film to be crazy because I thought the plot would be overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in published comments in advance, I agree that the feminist part of this film is not bothering. I had no idea that the main character was exaggerating her status as a woman. It's like Guzman's feet as a person with a spine, this unlike her classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was good, except the expected ending. It may have been better to give the plot a radical development, so that the viewer is somewhat more flabbergasted. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would say that Rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her personality. I can not explain why, but in the scenes of love convinced me. It seemed real, I think. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 out of 10, just for the last half-hour.
