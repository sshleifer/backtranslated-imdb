TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is probably the best film about all of Mary Beckford's films. In two hours, it was very long for a silent film in 1922 and still keeps your attention after about 80 years of filming. Mary offers one of her best performances at times, where the role seems like "greatest successes" with parts of innocent Mary, Little Mary the Mary, Little Mother Mary, Mary Fire, Mary the Romantic Heroine, It has been used throughout one film in the past. The film is surprisingly frank about an illegitimate child supported by someone in 1922, and sometime it is thought that little Mary is the unmarried mother in question! If the Oscars had been in 1922, the best actress Oscar for the year would be Mary.
