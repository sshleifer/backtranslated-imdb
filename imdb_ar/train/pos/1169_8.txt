A sleek, temperamental and innovative bloodbath. Cheesy too, of course, and I got intermittently. I remember a lot of The Big Heat because it contains a reprisal plot set off from the exact same event, and the girl comes along with the good guy because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. It is sad that there is no Gloria Graham, but this is so wonderful that it is Alan Dillon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be any beautiful person like Alan walking around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? However, it is quite harsh completely cool. No one can touch it at the moment - although a person like Jude Law can be tried. It's hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was unconventional and perfect and there were many excellent car chases (and this is not generally my tea cup) - especially a wonderful one in the woods. People also met their dreams in a creative and bloody way, for example in the yard crusher. But beyond cheese, the atmosphere was affecting and coming out efficiently. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" film than I have seen recently.
