This film was not the best of all the last season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any film produced for the TV that I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250", I see only one film on the small screen made: How Grinch stole Christmas. I think the time has come to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the original series had many offers that were better, but I did not mind. I just love to be able to enter the world of Baltimore's homicide squad again!
