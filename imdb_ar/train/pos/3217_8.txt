Kurt Russell is very reasonable and work ceaselessly so that he needs to think about it afterwards to realize that there are important honest topics to good [overcome the fear of the stranger, learn to rise above early conditioning, the power you love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the story. This is very rare for a "flick about a person" so I [who think most A / A is a violent laminate] I loved the film and recommended it to everyone I know ... It is shameful to be overlooked because through rights, It is one of the biggest box offices for adventure action - it has something for everyone without straining credibility or losing moments of almost never-ending movement. I am afraid that the answer will not be successful in the fact that the adults did not go to see him. No one under 20 may have seen more violent action in his video games, but he may not be able to catch up with or care about multilevel or multi-theme beauty. This movie can convert anyone who avoids A / A as reckless violence. If a man of his mistress [or hired her or watched her on the cable list] to watch this movie, she would be more likely to make her go with him to other clicks.
