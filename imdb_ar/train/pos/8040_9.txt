This will be somewhat short. First, do not listen to critics, because it's not as bad as most say it is !! Sniper uses a formula for classic movies, which many dismiss as errors in the film. While the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our military snipers work in our country, it gives those who know nothing about snipers a glimpse of sniper world. And yes, the film contains a lot of flaws, but what film does? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Bringer. I must say that the worst two scenes are at the beginning of the film with Billy Zein in the helicopter followed by Zen in the Marin Bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of the field with the corresponding force sweeping it !! Also there are lots of good shots of the forest and some classic shots that use the camera as if you were looking through a gun. And yes, the sniper logo is "one shot, one kill". Judge a sniper for yourself! <br /> <br />
