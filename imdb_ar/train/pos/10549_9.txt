I have seen this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it will be widely shown because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Android and David are more than just a task. Any discussion about the plot may be considered spoilers, so I will just say that the story of the story is clever, the representation is wonderful, the effects are amazing. Good filming the pace is very good. One of the best films I have seen over the ages, it is very refreshing in the bleak summer of films <br /> <br />. The audience was laughing all the time. See if you can. (I particularly liked the scene "Candy bar! Candy bar!".)
