I loved Antz, but I loved "insect life". The animations that have developed in this have borne fruit. I will definitely get this on DVD. By the way, Disney should produce a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I recently heard about pressing all the characters in the screen in standard video format). Most would have to agree that the final credits were the fittest! I saw only one of the two groups, but I can not see the other!
