This is a very funny film! I have no idea whether it translates well into other languages. However, I think that men all over the world can communicate with Frank and his ideas to some extent! These ideas are very entertaining, and women will also enjoy this film. I'm sure about that! <br /> <br /> All team members have performed well, and this film may be a huge success all over the world if it is produced in England or the United States. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are in a fun place! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
