HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. The sub widget is original and the main plot is better. The special effects are fantastic and probably the best I've ever seen in a horror film. Kevin Bacon once again proves that he is capable of handling any role that comes his way. <br /> <br /> Claude Raines shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933, and now, Kevin Bacon has hit us * with Holo Man. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The work is intense and the chills are correct. You may find yourself jumping if you see him in the dark on a stormy night. Support team includes Elizabeth Choi, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slutnik, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randall. All of them are doing an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caen (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret of making someone invisible. After animal tests, they move on to human tests. But someone has to be subject. Volenteering, Ken turning invisible. But when his team can not return to sight, Cayenne feels crazy about his condition and seeks revenge for him. * End of the spoilers * <br /> <br /> The film has created an unforgettable shock sequence and is turning into a classic well in the next century. Has become the basis of a cynical joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this film snaps you by the throat and never lets you go. The first 45 minutes or so slow, develop the characters and show how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most fans of movement and horror. Think of the deep blue sea. Then change the sharks to a crazy invisible man. Then change the water to fire and explosions. Re-framing the killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
