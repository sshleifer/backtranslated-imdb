Along with "King of the Rocket Men", this was still repeated on BBC television in the early to mid-1980s. If I download a time capsule from this period, it is certain that these two series will enter. <br /> <br /> Someone who watches it for the first time will think it's silly but that's one of the best examples of "serials". He will make you Don Del Ouro laugh (when I was young his pseudonym was Mr. Dustin's head) It was funny when he shot him saying: "Your lead can not hurt me" then stumbles and seems less than happy. I also love the way he deals with Sebastien in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I've seen this again because I remember good memories of him years ago, there are some good stunts and good music, and she has the ingredients you expect including water, falls and fugitives ... apart from the first episode With Ralph Faulkner), the swordplay game was not as good as I remembered it, and yes, it has the inevitable "flashback" episode! He gets 8 out of 10 because he still suffers from slow padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend William Whitney's book, "In the Door, in a Fight, Outside the Door, in a Hunt" although there is only a small entrance around the series in it.
