This movie was very entertaining. The soundtrack (Bill Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. The most impressive thing is that Brian Adams did all the songs in French as well. The result is also fascinating and exciting. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of a mix of traditional animations, as well as images created by the computer. The result is truly spectacular. I watch this film at least once a week with my children and never get tired of it. The story is convincing and well narrated. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who classifies this film less than 7. Surely he is a guard at my house.
