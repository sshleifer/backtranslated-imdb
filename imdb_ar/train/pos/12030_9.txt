Hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love Twisted Desire and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on television just as I think it's fine. I'm a real fan of Sabrina's teen too, so it helped me watch it (do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans to kill her parents very carefully, making sure someone else pulls the trigger and the practices on the bottles, so she will not give up her fingerprints (a well planned idea), again I think all of this was counterproductive to Nicole when she was arrested While her old boyfriend comes and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I gave this film nine out of ten, and put it on the top 10 movies. Last but not least if anyone saw this movie in the shops, please tell me as I saw it on TV and did not register it. Good-bye
