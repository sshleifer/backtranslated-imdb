I have not seen much German comedy, but if this movie is far away, I have to see more! The simple and effective story takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, the mother of two unemployed children, discovered that her husband, the artist, was dealing with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. Will not reveal anything else, but the results are a series of very ridiculous events with the perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... does not let the annexation of young children fool you into thinking that it's a family movie) likes comedy - even those who do not know the language.
