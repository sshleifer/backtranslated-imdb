The election pictured the second film of the trial community directed by Johnny Toe. <br /> <br /> To portray Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fei as outstanding actors in the role of Locke and Lebig Dee, as members of the experiment, they were selected as candidates for this post by the President of Ho Sing Community Council, a 100-year-old pilot community. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who keeps his composure at all times, Big D is not only impatient, he also thinks he is on top of everything. Locke was elected as new president for two years. In order to fully control the gang, the newly elected president must be passed with Dragon Baton, who represents power and power. Big D was not very satisfied with the results that he was not chosen to be the next president after paying a handsome bribe figure to board members. He ordered his leg to get Baton before he was caught by Lok. <br /> <br /> While Big D gets Baton, Lok has his other plans. <br /> <br /> This is one of the experimental films of the experimental community where there is no need to shed a lot of blood. Johnnie puts human greed in the film, where the use of bloodletting in other thematic films is common in the testing community to show how human greed can cause someone to die or fall. However, not a single shot is used, barely involved in the election battles. It is the battle of intelligence that makes the elections stand out from the rest. <br /> <br /> Aside from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in the election who has less than 5 lines to speak in the entire film, the masculinity controls the entire film. Lewis Coe and Nick Chung, who was seen in the previous movie Toe, were portrayed as a secret policeman and gang who sold his life to the gang respectively. Along with some veteran actors who have appeared in the film and the excellent script, he makes the only film from Hong Kong to represent the Cannes Film Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> The election has barely failed any critics wanting to experiment with a different film theme community.
