The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is naturally excellent which is what the film should be represented; the skill of directing is skillfully handled in every detail that I do not feel tired of seeing again and again. Still, I am surprised when I see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, and Attenborough's perplexing interests: Are not they proud to claim they have made an excellent long-lasting film for the public? I hope to get some answers to the puzzles I have given from someone (perhaps a member of "Knowledge") of the film.
