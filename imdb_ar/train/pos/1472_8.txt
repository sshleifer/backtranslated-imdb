Lots and lots of information to be digested, and if you've seen Zizek, you know its speed. <br /> <br /> Also if you have not seen most of the movies or at least some other films made by the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be lost to some extent. <br /> <br /> The movie list is long. These include films such as Psycho, Vertigo, Birds, Lynch (Lost Highway, Mulholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) Such as segway, star wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but these I think they stab. Sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or if you mind) psychological analyzes, you'll feel annoyed to infinity. <br /> <br /> But, like setup, clips, the way the movie overlaps with these clips, the Zizek points should never be boring.
