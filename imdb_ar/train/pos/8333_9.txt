Intelligence is a fascinating and exciting romantic comedy that digs the greatest and deepest scientific minds of the 20th century as assistants to Cupid. The overlap of heart and mind is a central theme of this lukewarm and thoughtful film. You do not know exactly how to interact because part of the time you see great scientists doing silly things to bring up the love that is emerging, but at other times you hear them discussing some of the deepest mysteries of space / time of our time. The end result is a fun movie with surprises all the time. Walter Matthau is ideal for Einstein, and Meg Ryan creates an eccentric mathematician. Tim Robbins shows in life the contradictions of a well-educated, well-educated man intrigued by science. Together, they create a comic journey through love, science, mind and heart.
