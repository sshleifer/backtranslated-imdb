This is the best movie I've ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett and Richard Miller - Two humans who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and cities, one shot - kill one !!? You should kill, if you suspect something, you should stay !! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I apologize for my bad / worst / English language !!!
