Very good movie of Preminger. Sometimes a maze, also explores groups and languages ​​of various angles and views as if the film were the nature of modern city dwellers and how they lived. In this sense, it is satisfactory visually and spatially, where his hero, a good policeman with bad temper, collides with hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and was never the best. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight, and almost elevates it to the level of tragedy. As a girl, Jane Turney is attractive but not noticeable. Gary Merrill makes an interesting evil, with his natural warmth providing a wonderful contrast to Andrews' splendor; his friendly evil smile seems to challenge his opponent constantly through the fact that he is emotionally open, as opposed to the deeply wounded moral policeman. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film, which seems to be a transition for everyone involved. For Breminger, he reunited with his stars in Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who were both professional climbers soon. Supporting actors - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are, in a sense, more optimistic, because they were all on their way. Preminger, as a quiet observer, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, because the morally ambiguous end is somewhat disappointing, because the cat-and-mouse game between the adversaries looks bigger and more typical than any simple film with a much less solution. <br /> <br />
