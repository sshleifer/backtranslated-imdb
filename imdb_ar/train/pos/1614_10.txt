There is nothing you do not like about Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family in New York and get a little nostalgia when I see him. The actors and actresses, the plot, the sub charts, the humor ... were all wonderful. It starts very slowly, but much happens in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this film. In my favorite movie list, Moonstruck is No. 3. It's a movie "I feel good" where the stage is left tinnitus "that's great" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "Old man, if you give these dogs another piece of food, "Kryce, bring me the big knife," "Who died," "Do you love Loretta ....., good because when you do, it drives you crazy because they know they can." I always put Moonstruck when there is nothing good to watch it because it makes me happy.
