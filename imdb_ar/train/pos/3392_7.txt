This was an interesting film, especially in 1973. At that time it was a great success at the box office. After the 1970s he seemed forgotten, but her central messages were so important that they did not completely disappear. It was already 15 years ago at least ... Nobody heard about "global warming" before 1985, and a controversial issue about euthanasia was rarely debated. <br /> <br /> Groups and special effects may seem a bit old, but the big money for science fiction films was a gamble at that time. If you look closely you will see that everything is usually logical. It's a movie message, not for Star Wars fans who can not sit for one minute of stimulating thought unless it contains a million dollars of bangs. <br /> <br /> This was also the last good Hestons movie, the end of the famous science fiction trio of Destinopius. After that, it was all an epic disaster exaggerated and a huge crowd of people balancing. It may not be the most exciting film in two hours, and the end may be creepy and frustrating, but it is hard to find any film producer with courage that can no longer address such a subject.
