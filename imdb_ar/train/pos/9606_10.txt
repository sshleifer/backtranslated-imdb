This was the best film I've ever seen about bulimia. It's exactly what the sickness is about and how it is not always about diet and thinness. Show how people with bulimia tend to think about things like their outlook on life, friends, and themselves. The best line and part that really illustrates what a bulimia problem is, is when you say Beth "does not concern you!" This line has really shown a lot about personality and others who have the same problem. It has been shown that people suffering from bulimia do not suffer from this problem because of anything related to anyone else. It's only about them and them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person who is suffering from the problem rather than focusing on himself. She showed that Beth needed attention at that moment and needed her mother's attention at that time at most.
