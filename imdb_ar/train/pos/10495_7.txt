Save Grace is a nice movie to watch in the dull afternoon, when you look for something different from regular scripts and want to have some fun. I mean the whole idea of ​​this movie and all its marijuana is mad! It was the first movie I saw with this subject (drugs / marijuana) that does not really criticize him, but makes jokes about him only. Grace Trevethin is a widow living in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her deceased husband who has committed suicide since he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagined she had some of the money she had saved, discovered that she needed to pay all her husband's debts in debt so as not to lose all she had, especially her home, which she loved so much. They were not working before, and are in a tragic situation until Matthew, the owner of the orchard found very in the smoking pot, decided to partner with her in the sale of marijuana on a large scale.
