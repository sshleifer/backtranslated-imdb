I remember the original series very clearly because of a unique combination of bright humor and a terrible subject. Kolchak was a harsh journalist from the Ben Hesht school to report major cities, and his sharp determination and wise behavior made even the most vicious episode watch. My personal fv was "Spanish moss killing" because it was a completely original story. A poor man from the troubled Cajun of Louisiana Bayou, is participating in a sleep research experiment to analyze dreams. There is an inexplicable error, which literally dreams in the life of a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. This malignant appearance looks at all the people who have hurt the dreamer in his or her conscious state and brutally strangles them to death. Colchac is looking for this terrible truth, to the point of angering the police chief Joe Mad Dog (Cicca) and the main sleep researcher of Second City's founder, Severn Dardenne, to give up. The evil and ridiculous conclusion is in the Chicago sewer system, a serial series. Kolchak never got any better. Egypt.
