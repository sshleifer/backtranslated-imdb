Obviously this was the prototype for Mick Dundee but the adventures of Barry McKenzie are more entertaining. I enjoyed all the time and laughed loudly many times. A brilliant central performance by Barry Crocker in starring role, an Australian invades England to destabilize the plateaus in his non-transparent ways. Few Britons will be upset by Barry's harsh reviews of his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is thorny but friendly, and this is highlighted by the final line of the film, which McKenzie gave a bit hesitant as he boarded the plane to his home. "I just started to admire the album."
