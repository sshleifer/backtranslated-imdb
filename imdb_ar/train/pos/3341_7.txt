I watched this film on Thursday evening after a really boring day. I had no expectations, that was negative. Being the only movie I've ever seen Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifa (?) ... Do not ask why! But seriously .. this movie is very cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet such a nice nerd. :) Movies like that are excellent. Simple sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursday. I'm not a fan of sports, but it's about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Maybe the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment at all.) Haha
