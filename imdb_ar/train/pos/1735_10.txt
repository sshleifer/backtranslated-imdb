For the first time in Miss DiCarlo's tournament, all the writers can go out - from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, the Great American West, San Francisco's Peak Period, Ballet Dance, Opera, Vodafone, Stage Bandit Thieves, and Chinese Junk. Only when you think the plot can not get any screwdrivers, they do as well. It's brilliant, tongue taken in cheek. DiCarlo's character (called Anna Marie - not Salome, this is the role she plays) is based on the notorious career of Lola Montiz, who was the mistress of the king of Prussia and caused a revolution when crown jewels gave her. She fled to the American West. There is a town in Arizona called "Salome, where she dances", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez was dancing on the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobles who fall under its spell are not historically accurate. I do not suppose he is a wise Chinese man in a Scottish accent - but he is one of the favorite classics of all time and Dicarlo is amazingly beautiful all the time.
