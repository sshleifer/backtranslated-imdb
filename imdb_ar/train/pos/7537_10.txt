Contrary to what Christians hate, 700 Club offers real answers as well as inspiration. It also provides reliable news, commentary and a different view of what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is the best. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related commentary, those behind the 700 Club provide assistance to the needy, such as feeding the hungry through the Blessing process, providing medical assistance to those living in poor communities and giving hope to those in need. It's not hateful at all. If the 700 Club hurts you, I suggest accessing the remote control and switching the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or, in this regard, programs I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way in which the ABC family claims that 700 club views do not reflect the views of the ABC family.
