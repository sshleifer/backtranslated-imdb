I will begin by associating my first encounter with Prince's music. I was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing nude until "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful nude dancer. Later I began to hear other Prince's songs and really "dig them". When the purple rain came out I still know little about this fellow Minisotan. The movie blew me away. Immediately became the No. 1 Prince Fan of the "Child of War" generation. Later I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and Ali, and my nephew at V.I.P. Prince's ceremony where we sat next to his mother ... how wonderful! Coming back to the subject at hand, I agree with Siskel and Ebert who describe Purple Ryan as an instant classic. I have seen it more than 17 times and I love it completely. I thought the Prince's behavior was good, he fought a little Apollonia, but all in all was good. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid" so the prince took over. The film is visually stunning, a great pace (never slow), and terribly instructive. I put it on the list of best music movies of all time. The last time I saw it was about 7 years after the gap and still exist. I am very proud of his colleague in Minnesota Prince Rogers Nelson and I would love to tell him personally. He walked directly in front of me during the above-mentioned ceremony and said, "Hello," to my nephew but not to me. He was talking to his mother. I have crushed a little but it is still No. 1 with me.
