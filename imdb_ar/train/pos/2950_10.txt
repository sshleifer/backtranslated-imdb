If you are ever sad for not being able to get a movie on a DVD, it is probably a "rave" that you are looking for. How many times do you laugh when watching a comedy routine stand up? I was younger than to see Richard Pryor during his biggest time, and when I was big enough to see Eddie Murphy and The Hollow and Raw (not funny) I did not know where Eddie got much of his inspiration. Now that I grew up, I saw both Brewer and several comedians after Murphy, I realized two things: everyone is stealing from Eddie, while Eddie Lovingley borrowed from Richard. This is the big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? And more. It was something unprecedented. It was all we ever needed. These days Eddie Morphy is boring and old ?? But once the king was, and the "rave" was the greatest castle ever built. Really one of the most rude of all time.
