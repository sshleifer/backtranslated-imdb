In fact, this is one of those movies that you should give 7.5 to. The truth is, as already mentioned, it's great fun. Fantastic atmosphere. Askey has already been put on top, but it's a great tool for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter for Will hay. If you love old movies in dark houses and trains, this is definitely right for you. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it's the type you want to watch over and over again. It is friendly and charming in a kind of granulation with all the nostalgic references that made the wartime fare wonderful. The band "individual" characters simply play each other as they do in many other typical British war films. It was great watching this movie if it was recorded by Ealing Studios. It is a real pity that the original 1931 did not survive intact
