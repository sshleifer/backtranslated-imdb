Unfortunately, many consumers who write comments for IMDb are worth a low budget with no good. All that this film may need is more budget is not part of it. Big groups and lots of special effects have turned him into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden is almost unknown to capture the role of mysterious humility, which is essential to the success of this film. Her wise little smile and her usual looks are enormous, and you find yourself hoping that the camera will not give up her face. Which makes it practical that the bad guy Nikolai, who also plays a little unknown (in the United States at least) Nicolaj Koster-Valdeo, may be interested in her brain unusually, something that can be exploited by humility. She is able to turn her rape into her gently and spit it out "Stop wasting my time!" And then storming his followers heavily armed but suddenly. Making such a reasonable scene does not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have in the narrow Staden game that Modesti plays is that it is not believable to play hand in hand. With a muscular man looking at muscles like the Waldo Coaster and beating him. It's not just a beta-Wilson or actress-type Hilary Swank that can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Valladow, whom Staden left himself, seems to be surrounded by his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not actually a movie, it is not a big mistake. I just hope they do better than that when and when they make consequences.
