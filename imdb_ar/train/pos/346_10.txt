What a wonderful movie! The fluctuations were wonderful, very scary, well written, nice, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprising end will make you smile on your face. This flick about the horror of popcorn that may not be attractive to non-horror audiences, but it remains (though) one of the best thriller movies out there today! I strongly recommend it to fans only: <br /> <br /> 1) Type of horror <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> 2) A representative or an actress. **** **** of **** stars! <br /> <br /> Note: I'm fed up with people who compared this and other modern horror movies with SCREAM. I know what, they did not want to be like yelling. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied the scream!". Well, if I'm not wrong, SCREAM has also copied other movies too! In fact, each horror film was copied from a previous film. Cry, however, was a good film. But, still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> Go and rent this! <br /> <br />
