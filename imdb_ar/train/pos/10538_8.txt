I work in a film shop, and that's why I always watch an excellent film. I decided not to check anything as in our Canadian section, and I try to support my film industry. I was in for a surprise. The movie David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are shown in a very amusing story and seem to deepen in many of our minds and relationships ... without working hard. She is constantly comedic through the interaction of the two letters, as well as some ridiculous exchanges ("We can not die, we have a cable!"). The most I can say without mentioning it is worth a shot, even if you give it up during the first half of an hour.
