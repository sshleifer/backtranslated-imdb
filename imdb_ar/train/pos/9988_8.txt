What I liked about adapting to the screen with The Stone Angel was that it was in line with the novel! Great movie! As a thirsty reader, I find that the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book is somehow lost in translation. You can tell Stone Angel to be careful not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstein was a great choice in choosing Hagar's role, and she is certainly a movie star. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne), who chose to play Hagar in her youth years, has also done an amazing job that is highly commendable. I have not seen any of Horn's previous works, but I will definitely look for them after seeing her perform Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> I heard that the Canadian Theatrical Angel will be released in spring or summer 2008. I can not wait to see it on the big screen again!
