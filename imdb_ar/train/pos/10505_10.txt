Yes, that's right, it is. I firmly believe that both the N64 and the strange-looking controller are designed to make this game. It was fantastic the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. The gameplay control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has the charm of Nintendo which is always intangible but undeniable. Any owner must have N64, and a reason to get N64 to anyone else.
