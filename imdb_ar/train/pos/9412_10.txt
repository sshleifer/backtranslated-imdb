When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist too. There was something magical and useful in science. Girl - girlfriend took along to see her again. I do not think they were as impressed as you! It was a comedy but it was dangerous, at a time when synthetic fibers were fairly new. The lessons learned from this film can be applied to issues related to GM's experiences today.
