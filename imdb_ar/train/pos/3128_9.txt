corny! love it! Tricky - just as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Brett recreate the same chemistry that appears on the screen and does not seem to have ever left! They revive old memories, as well as the actors they play in the 1960s, and show some things behind the scenes that are interesting to know. Television in the 1960s was a waste of time for many of us at the time, and this digital disc is no exception if you're familiar with the original TV show. Battle scene with Bouffs written and Bams or anything wonderful !! The scene of the movie theater offers a break from the bad guys who passed away. In the end Frank Gorshen appears. I think he died not long after the production of this CD, I think it is credited to bring him back to play wicked to Adam and Bert, just as he did with Batman and Robin several years ago. Did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to recreate the life of the villain role, too. In conclusion, I think this DVD is dedicated to great memories, and I would like to thank both Adam and Bert for their return and re-creation of those who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys !!!
