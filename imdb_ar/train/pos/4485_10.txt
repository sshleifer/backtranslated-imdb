This is my favorite of the old caricatures of Tom and Jerry from the early 1940s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, a single disc, and displays the great detailed animations of early animation. These gags in this style are not all Avery style, but they are more accurate and target everyone who stays awake to watch scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decides to play a number of tricks for his rhythm. The nine-year-old morsel was well placed here, and I do not know how often I tried to make a scary space and paper when I was a child. When Tom's owner woke up by a melee - Mami was not the maid, she was in her house - she was getting one surprise, with a big laugh. Get the pause button ready, it's worth it!
