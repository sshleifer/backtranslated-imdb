I saw this film when I was about 7 years old - who was 33 years ago - and I never forgot this film! I was very moved and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. I could not believe it when he became an eagle when everyone in the theater thought he would die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she remembered it the way we saw it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget him - just like my sister and I ...
