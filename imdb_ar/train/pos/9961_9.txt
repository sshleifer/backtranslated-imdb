I must give How How Move a semi-perfect rating because the content is really cool. As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie found itself in the IMDBs list below 100! This is too fucking silly! Other films - especially those that share the theme of dance - can not afford a candle for this film in terms of its combination of high-class, reasonable acting and amazing dance procedures. <br /> <br /> From the beginning it is very easy to delve into the basic story (not just winning a contest), which is surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this picture are two-dimensional by any means, and by the end of the film, it is very easy to feel emotional investment. (Even if you are not the kind of person who is crying, you may feel a bit vague before the credits start.) <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers, and even more, to those who can appreciate an impressive story and good disposition. How is Move is not an ideal course (what is a movie?), But it is definitely a movie above that uses beautiful faces to hide a half-baked plot and / or characters lacking substance. The actors and settings in this film represent a very realistic journey that is equally enchanted by the wonderful talent of dancers!
