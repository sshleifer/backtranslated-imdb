I claim that everyone who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie has made a total mistake. No one wanted to see this film based on the reviews, and everyone who saw it already (and I know) loved it completely ... The advertising campaign is a shame / a disaster / a mistake. <br /> <br /> Open in fourth place after ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, averages an IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, who has watched a great movie but the third week out, average IMDb scores 8.7 (worth to say). <br /> <br /> # 3 - The Simpsons movie, which I saw, is a good movie but the fourth week is out, average IMDb score 8.1 (slightly higher in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score 8.4 (lower then Bourn, but this was our 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Whether it's a poor schedule or poor ads, I think the powers behind this film have been ruined a lot! Should this be announced as an amazing film that happens to be a fiction / novel and is not just announced another novel ?? Very bad :( Anyway - now that I screamed hard to no avail ... Wonderful movie, go and see!
