I do not know if I'm too weird, but I totally enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Returning to the Cabin by the Lake is of course a sequel to one of my favorite films by Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. I also thought that the cast in this film was wonderful, Jude Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming Cabin by the Lake in Stanley's Cabin by the Lake - it was not an entirely unnecessary film about Stanley sucking and drowning other girls. - If you're looking for a deep meaning, this movie may not be the right one for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, go ahead and watch. She may have already killed at least 10 hours to watch this film. :)
