BASEketball is one of the most popular films I have ever seen. It's an out-of-the-box movie starring South Park producers Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Most of the hugs are already hilarious but the most extreme parts of the film are when players try to "overcome" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do more crazy things. One drawback of this film is that the pace is extremely fast, and after watching for about half an hour, I found myself asking "Wow this is already over?" The other part of the funny film was how Joe and Doug were constantly harassing Squick, a young man. BASEketball is a classic comedian game with some quotes, and it's very fun to watch!
