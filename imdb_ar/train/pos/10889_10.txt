What with all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up on anyone single day. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) might end up on holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You should watch the movie if you want to find out why. Also, although I was impressed with Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a moment, if you ask me, they were small. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before I finish this, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell recorded a great success on vacations. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy which is sure to light up the day of anyone single to any fan of Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who have not seen him.
