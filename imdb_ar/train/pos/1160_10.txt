this is funy. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliott, but this is a funny man. Klein and the fields are great. (Line her toss "God, you are disgusting" as she climbs into his window - great!) Klein escapes to the door after she exits from Terry Hatcher - too great!) Robert Downey Jr. and Cathy Moriarty work flawlessly together - even discovering who she really is ... Turn the soap opera if there is one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the end in the Chinese eating area was my kids and I was trading on the ground - this scene alone is worth the rent price. <br /> <br /> No problems are solved in the world or appear to be an apparent flaw in daytime TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
