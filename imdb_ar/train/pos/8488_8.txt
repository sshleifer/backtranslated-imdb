I have to throw my year. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes For the most part, characters are written and acted on a large scale. I can not think of many comedies that were not there. This is not a new release, it's aired on the video and is broadcast over the cable almost every week. Do I see her in the theater? Sure, I did, when he first came out. It's funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I do not like it at all, I'm still watching him on Michael Keaton's cable. He's a real undervalued actor. I can not think of someone else capable of it in every kind. I can not think of who succeeded. A comedian is also an action star (short-term but still), who is also a romantic pioneer, and is also a dramatic actor; villain and hero. I can not think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly nothing that worked in all these types. I mean there's Tom Cruise but for me it's the best in Tom Cruise to become a character. However, it's not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'll move. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth a lease, make sure it is worth buying as you might find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. It's worth watching on cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun movies to watch. You can put your mind in a temporary state, just relax, chuckle. <br /> <br /> Request more, in my honest opinion, ask a lot.
