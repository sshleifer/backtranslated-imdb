I thought the children in the show did a very good job. I particularly enjoyed Emma's performance. Well done! The stunts were good for a low budget view. I managed to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed watching with the tooth fairy and burning it. The ghostly apparitions of the released children's lives were also good. Another good point of the film is that it kept moving. There was not a lot of slow scenes. The adult threads were also authentic and thus helped keep the show entertaining. All in all a pleasant night to watch movies.
