When the plague erupts in New Orleans, Richard Widmark becomes a survivor in the film "Panic in the Streets," one of Elias Kazan's lesser-known films. Kazan maintains a fast pace, and there are many wonderful touches - the viewer between Widmark and Barbara Bill Gedis, who plays his wife and the scene at the police station, shows family life, working life and the relations of ordinary citizens, a sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of low spirits, portrayed by Jack Ballens Weak Yes, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting pictures - Palance has a number of scenes with actors who seem to climb his knees up. <br /> <br /> The representation is great and the dialogue is sharp if the story is not good to the direction and the shows. It has some questionable aspects which will be monitored by the viewer quite easily. Aside, it is worth watching. Kazan was a masterful manager.
