Imagine that you are so bureaucratic that a man who spends 8 years of his life and has a mental breakdown tries to solve the issue of mass murder almost himself! The method of killing is clear, but any government unwilling to admit the truth, let's monster destroys dozens of lives. When I think my job is cumbersome, I just remember the real story behind the great flick. Ria portrayed devotion to the performance of the main character. The comic (and almost tragic) relationship between Rhea and Sutherland has made this one of my favorite films in the last five years. One of the worst collective murderers in history caught me on the edge of my seat. Although it was not announced and talked about as "Silence of the Lambs", the plot was impressive. Rent or buy this movie today!
