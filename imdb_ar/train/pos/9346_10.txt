If you do not enjoy this movie, either your death, or Adam Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent team, both made good performances. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler became a very respectable representative. He started doing it at Big Daddy, then performed some bad films, and then performed well on 50 first dates, The Longest Yard, Click, and Now Reign Over Me. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Adam Sandler plays the role of the man who has lost everything. The closest to the family that he has is his father's father-in-law. After exposing his old college colleague (Cheadle) to him, he seems to be changing his life. I will not say more, because I do not want to destroy the film, but I strongly recommend this film. One of the Best Movies.
