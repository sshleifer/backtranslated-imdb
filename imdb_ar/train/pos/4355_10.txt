I also watched this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about family relationships for adults. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, moving, moving, and also amusing. A movie like this would do very well with word mouth reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film. Let's just hope they have the opportunity. I would like to make this film one of the best films I've seen in a year. It does not contain any violence, scenes of business, murder, or sex, so it's clear that distributors are asking whether they will receive it or not. Believe me, there are people who want to go to see a movie like this one with an initial value, instead of many of the famous films we usually offer at the box office.
