I think this has the ability to be the best Star Trek series yet, I say the potential .. we all know that there is a chance to drop the ball and run out of ideas ... but I do not wish it! For those who have not seen it .. SEE IT! Without the "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating on their heads every time they race, it may be cold. Scott Bacola was undoubtedly a great choice for the captain, and Volcan Babel is very hot (see the decontamination scene). .. It blows all the other openings of the series .. I hope this is longer than 7 years ...
