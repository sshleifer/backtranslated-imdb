She has to sing. She has a drama. She has a comedy. She has a story. It's one of the greatest movies ever ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie, you must either be asleep or in a state of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Kenny sings and dances on his way to the Academy Award; but in this film is the best! This is James Kane at his best! It's fast with single linings! He's fast with his feet! It is a non-stop action. Singing and dancing classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". The staff is fantastic. The entire film is optimistic, fast-moving and confident. Although this film has been produced more than 70 years ago, it is still visible, even today. Of course, this film features Miss Robbie Keller (who was married to Al Jolson). She's the perfect partner for James Cane ... and Dick Powell too! If you love fast-moving movies, with lots of singing and dancing, this is the movie you'll see.
