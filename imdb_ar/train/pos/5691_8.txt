I was very interested in watching this film when it first appeared in the theaters, however, I could not get around it. In the end, I hit the shelves and captured them. I do not know exactly what to expect, the DVD has been dropped in the operator, settled in an evening of murder, and pressed to play. What followed was one of the most interesting clicks I've seen in the past two years. <br /> <br /> * Some saboteurs * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murders in Wonderland, which led to most parts of the state of Los Angeles directly and directly to the biggest start of pornography in the seventies, John Holmes ( Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the start, and I felt the idea of ​​the movie all the way up to the very bloody end. I was surprised when I found that the film focused less on actual murders and more on past events and then investigated. Apart from a few blood-splattered walls at first, and the actual display of killings near the end, the film was, to some extent, an attractive display of wonderful dialogue and great representation. But Val Kilmer sold me only as an unwanted porn star, and even "beautiful but that's all" Bosworth was a joy to watch her (and only her appearance, it's against you) <br /> <br /> I personally felt better The other side of the film, Lack of clear appearance of murder. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not quite see the brutal sands that were given to the sleeping Lord of the Lord. Moreover, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to excite my appetite. They were hit by bullets, and there was not much to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was Carrie Fisher's short appearance. Her portrayal of the excessive religious personality, I think, was a little trifling from her appearance. Maybe this person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I did not sell, and for some reason, Fischer seemed to be "very strange" in filming. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie is worth watching, even if it is once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
