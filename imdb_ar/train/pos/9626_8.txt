Warning! Forward spoilers! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw a movie in German, so I missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that came to me. I liked the representation of Lexa Duij. Sometimes I have the impression that they are * Camille. But I can not stop wondering what happened in the end with Bob, Cassie and her baby. I believe, having been initially appointed to Bob, ended up in the end to his love and remorse for what happened with his brother and forced him to lie to him. Otherwise it is a little strange, to carry her child and love him. It is up to the viewer to make a decision - I do not like these endings. Dean Kane was as good as he always was, Eric Roberts .. Well, I've seen him better but also worse. <br /> <br /> I think that the film is more analytical of human relations and react in unexpected situations the story of crime. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I liked her a lot.
