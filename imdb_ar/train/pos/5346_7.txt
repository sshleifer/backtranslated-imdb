Carol, the little girl in the story center, is planted in a foreign land, Spain, at the height of the civil war in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new, it's strange. War and her father are a source of constant concern, while they have to submerge themselves in a regional culture that is years too late for what they have in New York. <br /> <br /> Emmanuel Uribe runs the film in numbers. It is clear that Carroll's family is divided, while Carol's mother is married to someone who represents an Air Force pilot with the leftist faction, the rest of the family's sympathy with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story adds nothing to what has already been said, much better, but it's an easy-to-see movie. The magnificent landscapes of northern Spain are displayed. Do not expect too much action because most of what's happening is about Carol and the little boys you deal with. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol's role sincerely and innocently. Maria Baranco is the mother of Carol Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruga, the teacher who approves Carol. Caramelo Gomez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left behind when she left for America. This actor, who usually has leading roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, because it remains a mystery throughout the film.
