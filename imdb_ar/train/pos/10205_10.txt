I was reassured by chance. He was behind the film box because I thought he was a tenant. I did not know until I got home and saw him anyway. just awesome! Fantastic movie, and one of my three best movies of all time, recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is fun and easy to follow, it could easily be spoiled, but the actors and the director do a great job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are wonderful, offering a wonderful personality and doing a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> You must find a copy somewhere ...........
