It was in 1988, when I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" (on Austrian television). At that time, I was a senior fan of Spitting Image (since when I got the bronze rose for the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded every show on the tape and watched it over and over again - especially the "Rooney and Nancy Show". I remember this scene when Rooney stood in front of a panel of Abraham Lincoln (I thought he was a mirror) and said to himself, "I need a haircut." Or most of all, when he played a ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It is shameful that Spitting Image seems to be in limbo; it was one of the most brilliant and intelligent television shows ever made. Compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best ever. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been almost 20 years since then, and I hope to see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
