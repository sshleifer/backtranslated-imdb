Kurosawa, new in color, loses sight of his usual themes in reality and his perception of reality, and chooses to take a frustrating position on the slums of Tokyo. Kurosawa extends to a style that, in my opinion, was his opposite - in other words, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make a picture of Ozu. A bad pace, this perception is bad, this film is rare rare in this author of excellent work. While Ikiru, despite being worldly and frustrating, is still interesting and well-paced, and while Stray Dog depicts slums and social poverty in Japan without being heavy or boring, does desu ka den have all that one can expect from its power content, With none of the characteristics of replacing the previous images of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Be careful, this is not a film to be judged by Kurosawa.
