I recently watched the film and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie of the same genre "like away from her" - or even "Bucket List", but it addresses the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really hard to be a main character like Granny. The director does a great job with the challenge. Hajar is difficult to understand. Her world is rough and she is not a woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene expresses this without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Bernstein) was moved to a nursing home by her son and her husband. She is filming her on her way and abandoning her. Its edges are really tough. It means. It underestimates selfishness. It is a stone. I did not like - not even a bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we got an insight. We discover why you do not like the bellies, why do you prefer one son to the other, how did her loss form her personality ... I began to see the angel ... and began to admire her. I particularly liked when she poured her secrets on the boy in the cottage. Ellen Bernstein, you are a wonderful actor. Glory. Glory. Glory. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is a movie "Do not Feel Good", but it's definitely a movie that excites the viewer in sympathy. I understand more clearly that the harsh edges of a person's life are there to protect, they exist for some reason ... <br /> <br /> Hajar is not my mother - she is not even my mother's law or neighbor ... but parts of them are present in many women (And men) in my life. These parts make me more logical now that I have seen The Stone Angel.
