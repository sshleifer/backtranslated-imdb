I hate reading reviews that say something like "Do not waste your time, this movie stinks on ice." The thing about this reviewer so far for me, may have a kind of naive charm. If you like other "Whistler" series movies, this movie will be watched. If you love 40-year-old films, this movie will be viewable. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film, in my opinion, like any of the previous series starring Richard Dix starring. It's much slower, and the plot is vulgar. I've seen this same narration machine used in many other movies and is usually the best. <br /> <br /> But the representation is good, as is the lighting, dialog box. It lacks energy, and it is likely to know exactly what is going on and how it will all happen in the end not more than a quarter of the way. <br /> <br /> The series "Whistler" is a quasi-nuer, and there is personality, mood, lighting, camera movement and more important angles of the story itself. But this film is noir. It's very lightweight and Hollywood is so innocent. The character of Richard Dix and the character of none of his female directors should have ended in previous films. You never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> However, I will recommend this offer to watch at least one. I saw it at least twice myself and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment every time.
