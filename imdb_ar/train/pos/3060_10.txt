It is always sad when such "marginal" films are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers. "Panic" is a fascinating and impressive study of a character who feels trapped in the futility of his life. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi, like Alex, is as persuasive as always. This good actor seems to have a special talent to pull your heart out, no matter how flawed his character may be; we may not always overlook the lifestyles of the heroes he plays, but the feelings of fear and confusion he raises in us are often very familiar. The title "Panic" at first seems contradictory, given the lack of express emotion. At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. However, with the development of this story, it became increasingly clear that anger and despair, not indifference, were the driving force behind the existence of this man. <br /> <br /> More than once he has been reminded of his performance at Fargo. Another film strongly driven personality. In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we see a man of average age who somehow seems to have come out of harmony with the rest of life. He has lost his way, and the only injustice seems to be the deceptive darkness. He knows that he makes bad choices, but despair controls self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex communicates with Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (played by Neville Campbell) whom he met in a doctor. Office. Headquarters. center. Objectively, this union is less chance, and more work fate. Alex finds some comfort with Sarah, sensing that she is a lost colleague, like him, someone who lost his way and floats aimlessly throughout the rest of her life, waiting for her inevitable end. <br /> <br /> Selecting films like this is a great and compelling way for Neve Campbell to answer these critics who doubt their acting abilities. The characters she played are often the weak point, and Campbell does not offer any depth to show her acting muscles. However, this performance may have caught the eye of many. <br /> <br /> In an ideal film world, not only will there be a lot of movies like "Panic", but it will also be accessible and appreciated by a much wider audience. If you're watching movies for richness and depth of characterization, rather than just the latest modern special effects, then "Panic" is not acceptable to you. A +.
