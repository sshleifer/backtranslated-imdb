Peter Ostinov plays a mixed role out of prison when the film begins. Once he gets out of the gates, he immediately starts working on the scheme to make the pack back by stealing, although this time he has a set of very high scenes. This is actually one of the weaknesses in the film, because obviously he knows nothing about computers (little of which was not back in 1968) but he managed to become a genius on the computer literally overnight! Yes correct. Anyway, he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and get a job with a big American company so he can embezzle a lot of money in the end. Considering his knowledge of primitive computers, it's amazing how you put into practice a wonderful plan and manages to sneak into your computer system and defenses. However, it is a film after all, so I was able to suspend the disbelief. By the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) were able to escape by one million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, it seems very confusing and Smith declares that she has already managed to group more than 2 million people through smart investment in companies that started Ostinov (although she did not realize they were all bogus companies). This should mean that these shares that you bought in the end were worthless. What they seem to be referring to (and I may be guessing here) is that Ostinov and his new partners were soon put into stock before this became known and therefore the stock would become worthless. In both cases, it appears that the film is being published at magical ends where no one and everyone is happy - and that did not make much sense. It is really shameful, because acting and most writing was wonderful. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ostinov and Maggie Smith were just fantastic. <br /> <br /> If it seems to me that he has interpreted the end, let me know, because the film seemed vague in the details at the end.
