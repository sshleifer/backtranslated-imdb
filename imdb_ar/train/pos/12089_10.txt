<br /> <br /> The movie, dominated by the raven-eyed Barbara Steel, was seen when I was seven or eight years old and produced permanent photographs of pale-skinned men and women chasing a castle and demanding blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and other universal beauty, and the views of the viewers who died before Romero came to the night of death to live, to unite them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the relationship between this film and the chase, which is clever but ambiguous about existing powers. LA DANZA MACABRE is a B movie without any excuse, daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such draw for both of Bluhm Mountaining. Comparisons with superficial HAUNTING. <br /> <br /> No, this film does not need to be reshaped. Not only the product of the 1960s, but the large percentage of creatives who do not have skills in Hollywood can not understand McBride's version of terrorism. This formula depends on one major factor: good writing. Classic low-grade films such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share common writing. it is easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a conspiracy into the chaos of film today. Besides, let Hollywood try some original materials for change, and stop exploiting the superior product clearly in the past.
