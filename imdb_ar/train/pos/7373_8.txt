Before the usual comments, my main curiosity about this is not a love song is that while there is a running time included on the IMDb of 94 minutes, a DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States extends 88 minutes. Any input in this matter is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends who live a very difficult life go on an adventure. What they conclude is that someone accidentally shot a girl while the two fled on foot to the countryside. Instead of just a big chase, the film is complicated by Spike's child-like behavior, acting inappropriately, holding the boom box resembling a teddy bear. Some viewers may dislike the story that relies solely on Spike's character, but without adding a little bit of frustration to the story, the film was very easy. You'll notice how the most consistent personality of Heaton refers to Spike as a "big man" unlike the behavior and behavior of a "child out of control." Frankly, I've also been aggravated by silly Spike's actions, especially since the spray can be inhaled, but in a desperate situation, it seems clear that someone of his mind will choose a temporary escape. But, there was a Heaton to keep checking things up until things get on his head as well. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glennan Because Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I quit wondering why you want to pick up Spike from prison and continue friendship, because of the wonderful performance of Jinan. After all, there are many reasons during this tour which would be a good idea for Hutton to give up Spike and try to save himself. I assume that Heaton felt like my older brother to Spike, and it's hard to break the loyalty between them - until things get very desperate. <br /> <br /> While some movies are actually arts, they offer more flavor to the story rather than the footage of men running in the wild. The beautiful landscape, the rain and the vast gray sky provide a poor tone that increases the feeling of tragic circumstances. The result is also unusual, and the use of the song Public Image Ltd. "This Is Not A Love Song" because the title of the movie is very clever. <br /> <br /> In general, it can be understood if you do not care about this is not a love song because it focuses on two contradictory characters evading another man who is determined to chase them (played by David Bradley quiet and calm). It's not a great budget business entertainment. For the rest of us who enjoy looking for something very small and exciting, it is a worthwhile time and it provides some very tense moments that make you breathe a bit. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the movies that came out of Scotland recently, with likes like this, Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I am also somewhat grateful for the translations provided on this DVD, because the dialects are sometimes quick and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrated, dark and often tense, this is not a very tragic love song but full of stories. <br /> <br />
