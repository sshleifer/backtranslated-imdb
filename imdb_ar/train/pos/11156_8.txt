I usually do not like reality programs, especially those that benefit from the success of American Idol. But this is one I can live with. <br /> <br /> Comedians from around the world perform a brief routine of celebrity talent scouting, and if they love them, these guys will be sent to perform a routine for a real audience. Ten or twelve comics are then chosen to live in a house together and to conduct "survivor" style competitions using comedic tactics. Then one will be identified as "another comical place". I like to stand on comedy, so this is the reality that I should care about my composers. There are usually some very funny comics by choosing. These professions have started with talents such as Alonso Bodin, Ralph May, and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility to pick a lot of these comics for their contribution to actually show the drama. At first they lived together in a house like Big Brother, but they got rid of it now, thank God. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of comedians I have felt, they were chosen not just because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitudes, gender, etc. When it was clear that other comics must overcome them. But in general, it's a well-made real-life program, two chapters so far I thought they were statues.
