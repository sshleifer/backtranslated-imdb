This Chinese film has made me feel very similar to members of a culture that does not belong to me or away from me. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps the individual connect with each character, happily doing simple routines. <br /> <br /> All the actors are wonderful, and Xu Hozu exudes kindness and wisdom, but he is also weak and mean. Er Min, the underdeveloped brother, tells us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that this wisdom comes from the most diverse people in the universe. It is a different China, far from Chinese realism, yet it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
