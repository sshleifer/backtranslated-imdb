"The Grudge" is a new version of the famous Japanese horror series from Shimizu. Shimizu teaches that he does not deal with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person could do in his place: he forgets logic and focuses on giving viewers an enjoyable ride. He uses the famous cliches associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays these elements in an innovative way. The nonlinear novel is not just a gimmick but an interesting way to present a sequence of different views. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of the horror film is to intimidate the audience (in the same way that comedy makes people laugh), this film succeeds in bright colors. I saw him in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see the audience scattering on this stage. You may not play well in your living room.
