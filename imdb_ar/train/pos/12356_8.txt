Contrary to the summaries of some people, the women portrayed in the film Lesen Giesha. They are "prostitutes" living outside the most famous neighborhoods, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of women in the Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly useful, but their charm lies in how typical they are. The themes are universal and every day: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed playing art and acting very much. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of the time and place where I could not point. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main Ouiran, were thrilled to watch. I recommend this film only to people who want to taste Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
