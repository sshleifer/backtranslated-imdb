Bednkobs and Broomsticks were set during the Second World War, a fun fairy-tale adventure for children, starring Angela Lansbury as a witch who, with the help of three evicted children and a "Witchcraft professor," tried to thwart the Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> This film is an innovative invention, with lots of laughter, and children of all ages will be delighted with its wonderful characters, exciting story and attractive tunes. Lansbury is ideal, with the ungrateful charming Eglantine, who takes the three children on a lifetime adventure, and her three young partners (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as the villains who help fight the evil Hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fairly dated, but let's face it, kids do not care much about these things, as long as they're fun. And entertaining, will be. With some impressive scenes that blend beautifully between live animation and animation for a great impact, and the original movie charm of more than a hundred Harry Potter, it will be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slide of film escape. In fact, the musical number in Portobello Rod is just what makes the movie perfect, but with a lot of other things that can be easily enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Besides that, any film showing Kingdom TV The legendary Bruce Forsyth legend as a "flash" style like Harry Spive is a good assessment of me.
