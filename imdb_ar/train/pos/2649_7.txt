Walking with the caves, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a backward look at all kinds of humans (that's us!) Over the past 5 million years: who they are, how they were, and how they died. Along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have about these species, walking with the caves also examines what makes us human. I waited several weeks to see this and was not disappointed.
