Great addition to anyone's group. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie you do not see every day. They have excellent representatives to go with an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays a role like John McLean. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on the ground and leaves a few hundred survivors of a story that is not new but the story takes a new twist on it. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent in time to get information about a virus that has killed most humans. <br /> <br /> The actors in this were awesome. I must mention Brad Pitt, who was Farhana while meeting mental patient James Cole (Bruce) at a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> The director has done a great job in bringing a disturbing picture of a devastating future with man-made virus. <br /> <br /> Animals seen in the world of viruses have made it feel like they run the world when humans are transported to underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was excellent and must be seen and also must be owned. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this. <br /> <br /> 10/10
