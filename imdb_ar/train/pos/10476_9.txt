My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the album "Ristatix" of the same name, which I bought in 1993. I read the liner notes and the band said that the album, which is still prominently in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author Paul's book Corrington. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and ate it! Amazing reading! I have since re-read the book several times, each time I find some new elements of Desmond and his desire to complete Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996, on the video. I did not have a lot of good experiences with the Canadian film, but this film was good for me. Claire's role may be different, but in general I think Paul Corrington's vision has been well transferred from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Mori Chaikin performs impressively as isolated geniuses. The film deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands it. I highly recommend "Whale Music" not only music lovers, but anyone who has lost something or someone, and tried to find his way to the world.
