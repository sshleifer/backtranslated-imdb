If scientists behave in a manner that was H.G. Wells is confident that she will do in the future, history will not have turned into what happened in the things that will come. It is almost 80 years since Wells wrote "The Shape of Things to Come" on which this film is based rather than the world it describes, in some respects. <br /> <br /> There are well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwick, who are more than real characters. It is the main weakness of the film, dedicated to the philosophy of Wales in science that will solve all problems, and the rest of us stupid backward. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, Jillan of the same family, have a very optimistic view. Cedric Hardwick is skeptical that the man is rushing forward. Ralph Richardson is a warlord who grew up in the destruction of another 30-year war fought by modern weapons. By the way, since the atomic bomb was not invented, toxic gas was considered a weapon that almost destroyed humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wales, science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group far outweigh the world of politics to engage in such things. In the life of Wales, scientists certainly fled from the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. These same people but for their defeat, followed themselves to the allies and made atomic weapons that preached in modern times. If they acted as Wales wanted, someone like Albert Einstein would have led a group of scientists who would have established a new system after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wales made a mistake in time and in development. It seems he never imagined the computer as well as the atomic energy. Computer programmers are likely to be our rulers in a brave new world more than scientists today. Still things come, with the help of the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the groups that have been created, they offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of H.G. Wells, and certainly a respected thinker of his time even though he did not fully grasp the shape of the things that would come.
