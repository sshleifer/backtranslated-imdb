Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad community as the first real Mickey movie and I think this kind of description may be cliche. But, like all cliches, depends on the truth. All brands of Miike are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing, and difficulty in admiring central personality. However, Shinjuku is one of Miike's most distinguished films. He says in an interview that if he did it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what it means is that the film has really good energy and a raw edge that looks very new, although it may be able to capture a more visually or technically complex film, but it can not repeat or improve the purity of this film. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is so fierce, the blood flowing and the deadly beating are complemented by a magnificent scene in which a woman crashes into her chair. (Miike can only allow you to drop out of a sentence like this.) The movie is a great move, unlike Dead or Alive, which starts and ends strongly and falls in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar problems. It is clear that Miike is concerned about the relations between the Japanese and the Chinese in the post-war period. This emotional issue is well dealt with here, the central character that truly comes to life when it begins to understand its past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing enough Shinjuku praise. I do not want to give up much. This is Miike before he starts using CGI to move his movies and reminds us of something almost like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final change ensures that once the movie is finished, it will appear again to do everything.
