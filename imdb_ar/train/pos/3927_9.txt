Well, first correct the tag posted on the home page of this movie. Abby Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the film, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The person involved is Ann Rutledge, who was a close friend of Lincoln in the new days of Salem. Some say Anne was in fact Lincoln's friend, but there is no evidence to support her. <br /> <br /> Now, there are fabrications and perceptions in this film. Hollywood has always obtained a dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the case of the courtroom in the film is based on a real event: his murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although he has been largely imagined in this film with a lot of name changes, viewers will have to screen the screen . This is Hollywood's golden age, with drama at its best, and Henry Fonda probably gives the best Lincoln played by anyone.
