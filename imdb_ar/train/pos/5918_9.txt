One of the most interesting films that has been classified as "blaxploitation", Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of brilliant vision, written in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. But the message of the film was so strong that the NAACP gave it support (but reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in studying the rampant atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to dismantle.
