This is a wonderful film about looking for some bliss in everyday life. Speed, action in the camera, passion, the poignant musical result, and the sheer charm of this picture, make it a must. Not easily appreciated by immature or emotionally stagnant. The only drawback I can see about this film is that it was not captured in a technically perfect film format. It deserves Todd-O, Technicolor and the finest audio format available. (An intimate film can be produced in seventy millimeters). The effect of the magnificent Italian villas on its inhabitants would be more fertile and the beautiful little moments would be more beautiful and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as a sweet little moving film. I can not stop myself from seeing it every time it comes to satellites. The character transformations of the built-in, tight and unreliable are always fun to watch and I really have to recommend it often. <br /> <br /> Casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, and the representation is above suspicion. It's a middle-aged film and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful without overcoming the viewer harshly. Watch it in one session and make it affect you. If you do not get it, you may not have lived enough, or there is something else wrong with you.
