I watched this movie a few years ago and I must say that I really love it. Jason Patrick was perfect for this strange role he played. Did not matter. The scenario is good, that's for sure. In just a few words I have to say about this strange film, strange, so bold, but it's a good movie. I saw him a few years ago and I have never seen him since, I want to see her again and again. I know I will not tend to see them. The viewer, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is good, the film should have lasted longer. I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping to get Part 2 for this movie. Very bad, it did not happen. Jason Patrick: You're the guy! Very good film finish. :-)
