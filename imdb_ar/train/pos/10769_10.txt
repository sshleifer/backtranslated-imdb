I love Monte Carlo and I totally enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very elegant, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as she was the attractive young girl with a golden heart. George Hamilton was charming and the Italian gigolo ideal. John Candy has a field day as a happy. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a great performance as a nice housewife and a weak shrug. Cast a delightful band. Lots of talent, intelligent script, lots of happen and beautiful sites. Just pick me up for a bleak day. Especially in the winter when your trip to Europe is not anywhere in your horizon.
