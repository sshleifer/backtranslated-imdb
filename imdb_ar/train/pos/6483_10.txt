This excellent series, brilliantly reported by Lawrence Olivier, should be said to mark the beginning of the end of World War II. The origins were not fully examined by the fall of Germany at the hands of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped drive Hitler's demonic rise, but, as one reviewer says, That would be difficult, in a 26-part series with many breaking into them. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the anticipated shooting / combat movement, there is a lot of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are given to give the viewer an amazing insight, especially if they are not necessarily lovers of World War II. The episodes of "testimonies" and life on the home front of the main allies / adversaries, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, were very open. Showing the extreme brutality of the war on the front line and of course the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc., were handled very well. I would highly recommend this in any historical chapter for the younger generation (which can be said to be 47 years old!). <br /> <br /> There are some very strange things, like the advent of the new jet era, with the experimental Gloster pilot from Frank Whittle and the first time in the Gloster Meteor combat game as well as the Messerschmitt Me 262 German game - especially as V-1 was seen For the first time there was an amazingly smaller signal to the V2. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the most exciting secret and the wonderful weapons brought by the Second World War from the more barren old science. But a wonderful series made its mark and has done it since when it was happily repeated. <br /> <br /> A series of items to be owned as a box specified in history, on a DVD for anyone especially as an army fan. Jeremy Isaac and The Times TV should be proud.
