I've been meaning to see this flick for the last few months. I was really surprised at its quality. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds around a group of teenagers in high school who hang out with a boy named Marty. They keep harassing him until someone makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty terribly burned. <br /> <br /> After a few years, a group of reckless teenagers are invited to their high school which is now abandoned due to a ceremony. However, none of the reckless teenagers organized this celebration. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, teenagers begin to die in the most horrific way possible. I can certainly tell you that they too were bloody. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I discovered it was just a dream and nothing happened. But Marty in the hospital has severe burns. Although the murders did not occur, the burns and flirting apparently occurred. <br /> <br /> The representation is terrible but this is good. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The hackers get what will happen to them in the end, and you are finally satisfied with the victim getting the sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone to pick this up if you're looking for the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good mountain of the morgue!
