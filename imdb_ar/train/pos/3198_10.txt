So I felt while watching this movie. loved it. It was hilarious. But I felt like I was getting a sneaking look at someone's psyche and then laughing when he became crooked to make an interesting point. "I feel as though we have broken into someone's house and are now watching horrifying home videos without their knowledge," one friend said in this way. <br /> <br /> Another one of that strange truth about fantasy pieces in the movie. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town man appearing in a nearby television station hoping to get a movie - which he certainly does, although he does not, as initially expected. With high hopes of fame and importance, Harris invites to come and film a search for a truly terrible talent he organized in his hometown - Olivia Newton-Don. <br /> <br /> Director Trent Harris is doing a great job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage of an awkward child wants to have someone turn, over a subsequent reinterpretation, into a story of emancipation from a repressed sexual identity in a small town in America. At the same time, Harris criticizes the attitudes of small American towns, celebrity cults and exploitative practices of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn and Grispin Glover make amazing performances. Young Sean Penn is the most exciting - he follows closely the actual "Gary shots", but with subtle nuances to give a sense of interaction the way Harris wants. <br /> <br /> At the end of the naive large-scale Gary original is what prompted me - when contradicted with these possible interpretations of his position. <br /> <br /> A movie that should not be missed. I have not seen anything else like that. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
