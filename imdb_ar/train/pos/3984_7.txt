As part of the celebration of the Casino Royale, this film was shown with the new Bond Championship, directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost shut it down because I was a bit bored, but I'm glad I hung out. Basically May (Anne Reid) is the mother of one Helen (Anna Wilson Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a friend for years. Her daughter says she may want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing each other only a few days, Mai and Darren have a secret relationship. At her age, with 30 things, the new Bond ?! In any case, they obviously want to keep it secret, but he may regret it and wonder if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact, Helen asks her mother to beat her. He starred as Peter Vaughan as Totts, Danira JoviÄ‡ in the role of O'Brieg, Harry Michel as Harry, Rosie Michel as Rosie and Oliver Ford Davis of Johnny English as Bruce. very good!
