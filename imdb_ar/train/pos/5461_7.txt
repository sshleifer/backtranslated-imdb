Leila Bowers (Barbara Stanwyck, who is simply a witch) escapes from the life of her father (and the frank waiter) who died in an explosion, traveling through branches in a banking business in Gotham. When a deadly lover kills, he is supposed to be his next mother-in-law (and the new night mistress), the sky is the limit for Lily because she has written her various relationships in diaries and delicacies that make them known if some payment does not come into her hands. Kurtland Trenholm (George Brent), the newly appointed head of the bank, sends Leila to Paris instead of skipping a lot of dough, but he quickly finds himself madly after various encounters with him in the City of Love. This makes the mouth water of Leila where she will now reach the base of success to seduce a man of wealth and prestige bring her wealth in her way. However, the circumstances will bring her to a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving that wealth .. Trinholm, now her husband, is convicted of a certain prison and lost the bank. He needs the money Lily has now or will have nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the entire movie though the usual in Warner Brothers. Appointment in the pre-code era gives directors the opportunity to clarify taboo topics such as a woman who uses sex to succeed and how it can lead to tragedy. A good trend from Alfred E Green comes through subtle hints in a different way of speaking and speaking through a good representation of Stanwyck's tempting performance of how to show something without actually showing a verb. It is clear that the film shows that money is not everything and all jazz where love enters the heart of the dead heart of Laila. That end after Lily achieved the miraculous transformation to a person in love was not really for me. She spent all this time getting to that platform just to fall on a man who was no different from before.
