BEWARE HUSBANDS is a new version of the BRIDELESS GROP classic Shemop. The new cooking scene of the film at the beginning of the film is wonderful. The fools are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking shots, we traveled to the clips of BRIDELESS GROOM One thing I noticed about these new versions from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit the new story. They enter a snapshot if the old story line does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I will not give it up to those who want to be surprised. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 Stars.
