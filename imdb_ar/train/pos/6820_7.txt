The film was much better than the other reviewer. It is a beautiful family movie. She has a fantasy side of some fun traveling time. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to return in time to the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearance. Find a girl and make friends with her about her age and can help the girl's family in several ways. She is also able to help her relationship with her father in the long term. It reminds me of Holmark, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seems to be more aimed at children aged 6 to 12 (perhaps a little larger) and PG or G has been rated highly. I'm an adult who can appreciate the beautiful "family" - I think the other reviewer is not.
