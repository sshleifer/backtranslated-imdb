All I can say is, the first film of the season that caught my attention. I chose it because of actors, Jerry and Claire, and the story looks promising ... I just saw it and I can say - I'm soaked. There are horrific scenes, true ... but that's what makes them more realistic. We should not escape our reality. These things are happening right now. There are experts who try to change things and make things better and laugh at their commitment to the cause. In fact I can not feel "Hollywood touch" in the film..and that makes it better. Claire and Richard played wonderful roles, and deserved 10 of me.
