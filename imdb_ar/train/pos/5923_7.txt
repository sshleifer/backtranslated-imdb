A woman who hates cats and her son Brian Krause has moved into a small town and has to deal with a middle teacher (Glenn Shadix), her relationship with incest, a beautiful girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one of a great mystery hell. <br /> <br /> Well, technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It's very fun too! <br /> <br /> Things are impossible (including corn), people are afraid of kitty cats, there are bad one lines, there are too many cheese can not handle it! <br /> <br /> So, yes. You will enjoy this. a lot. It will not take you, grab, scare, or provoke you in any way, but it will keep you enjoying and laughing!
