I liked it was a strange plot, and Drew Barrymore and the capital were making embarrassment for each. Acting was acting dodgy in some places, but this may be due to her life at the time. Dennis Christopher was fantastic, as always he is doing his best - I'm a big fan of Dennis anyway, that's why I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the finish! This strange bone thing with a red skeleton looks just like it was outside the film school, which is good, I thought it could have been more. <br /> <br /> .... And it's all with the knife - if this is inconvenient why did not they get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing for the time when the odd thing was in Doppelganger or when he was in the capital - or was Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger was manufactured with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick, if Dennis is Doppelganger, I think Patrick will notice. <br /> <br /> The music was fine but it was prolific in some places, the full result of the orchestra seemed to revolve around a theme but the subject was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great mix of lots of blood and free shots of naked Drew. <br /> <br /> All in all from GPM-Guilty Pleasure. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and wonderful texts because you will not find them. There are some diamond moments and ample sheep - just saw them and have lots of fun!
