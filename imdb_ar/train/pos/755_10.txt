Dirty Sanchez is the most extreme British version of Jackass where the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go so far as to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason that this show is better than Jackass is because most stunts are not planned which makes the reaction more funny. There are 3 series of premieres, the first follows them and takes a long look at their lives for example. There is a ring about their love lives, jobs and so on. The second series sends the boys to experience different careers. The third follows their European tour. The boys seem to be getting bolder as the show progresses through the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say, if you have a week in the stomach you do not see, where you can see quite a bit of blood and vomiting in each episode.
