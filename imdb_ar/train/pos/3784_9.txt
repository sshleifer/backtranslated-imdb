One of the most unreliable films I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's trip from Bill & Ted is the fun second adventure of Bill S. Preston Esc. Ted Theodore Logan, also known as Wild Stallins. There are two ways to look at this film: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a distant conspiracy, an idea of ​​events. Or .. you see idiots underestimated, and who find themselves once again in a very big position for their brains. Throwing Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger into the plot becomes a big blockbuster film. Bill and Ted go to the story with the same level of sincerity, only Bill and Ted. This is a difficult fence to balance, but when you watch the movie not as a comedy, but as an adventure involving two young men who have no work on an adventure, it becomes much more.
