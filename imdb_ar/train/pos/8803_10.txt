I recently saw this on Sundance TV. The idea of ​​the film was to bring in many filmmakers, brilliant in their own country, to produce short films, eleven of them, all in one film, focusing on one theme only: September 11. <br /> <br /> From wacthing this movie I can tell why these directors were wonderful in their country because it had all the elements of a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran in which the teacher struggles to teach students what happened with the events of September 11, which they failed to recognize until later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France includes deaf women who write a letter to their lover angrily while they are unaware of what is happening on television dramas. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt includes the same director talking to a dead soldier about recent events, not only about terrorists in the September 11 events, but explosions elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Next comes Bolivia, where the 9/11 girl learns and thinks she should go. <br /> <br /> Next from a country in Africa where a group of boys follow a man they believe is bin Laden. <br /> <br /> Coming from Mexico, there was nothing but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next is from Israel, where a reporter is participating in the location of a bomb trying to get a report but is being told a lot about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies I can do "you do not remember right now, but they are all strong, you will get your feelings back from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
