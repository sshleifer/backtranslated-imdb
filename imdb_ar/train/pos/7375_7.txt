Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2) but still a good Japanese horror. I hope that the horror producers in North America will come out with a page of Japanese horror and put more "horror" and less costly shocks in their hearts. Many good examples of this scene, where a shady face is seen staring behind a young actress, suddenly takes pictures on the wall and smiles, for a second, and more. Worth checking out if you like this type.
