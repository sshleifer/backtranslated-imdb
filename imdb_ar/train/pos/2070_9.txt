Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars in this film about a young man looking for answers to his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Moro all play first-class roles in their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has a slightly less exciting task than trying to make a film dedicated to television (25 years ago) by providing "sexual interest" in a sexless film. The real star, however, is the California Kid; the 1934 Ford Coupe, borrowed from Jacob's "Jake", is placed in front of the camera and gives an exercise that will leave the viewer panting, panting and clutching the seat edge with breathless anticipation. The sights are amazing, (although some dialog box is a bit lame) making for a wonderful evening turn. This is the way "car movies" should be produced. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this movie on the late movie channel; it's worth missing sleep.
