The Killing Case begins with running and does not stop until the end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim, and tried several people. William Powell is as wonderful as Philo Vance, the esteemed investigator. Marie Astor is revived as her niece who wants to marry her Scottish man and enjoy her inheritance. This movie comes with a "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on a DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disc (or withdraw it from your local library), do so. It's pure entertainment!
