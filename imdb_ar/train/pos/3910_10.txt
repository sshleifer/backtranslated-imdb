So I'm at home, I turn the channels one evening, I watched this guy wearing his heels and makeup, standing in front of a colorful background on HBO. Of course, I made a double decision and decided to watch it for a short time. I did not change the channel until it ended, it was very joyful. The next time they worked, I made sure they were registered so I could watch them over and over and stayed one of my favorite things to watch. During the first and second minutes, you can say that the audience is not sure what to think about, but he quickly wins with the amazing sense of humor and intelligence. While many comedians who interact with each other gather in my mind, Eddie Isard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and maturity when most comedians are committed to current events. He stayed with me after that. I went to Italy during the summer and all I was thinking of while I was there was "How Italians are always on scooters as they go" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See it. You will not regret.
