The Last Hunt is a classic Hollywood forgotten world. The subject of genocide by slaughtering buffaloes is in other films, but not brutally. The anti-dance role of Robert Taylor as Jamus Jamus and an Indian murderer is his finest performance. <br /> <br /> In the fifties of the last century, your mother was dropped by you and your friends in Saterday matin√©e, often showing a musical or a comedy. But it was wrong then and now let a boy see psychological dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to repressed sexual sadistic films and extreme racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why did my mother fail to watch these movies? Because they showed "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climate scene in The Last Hunt is as horrifying as the Vincent Price boom in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The legend of white buffalo films, part of the film's texture, later exploded with other films including The White Buffalo, starring Charles Brunson as Wild Bill Hickock. The laughter here is that Brunson used to play Indians. <br /> <br /> Today, a large herd of bison remains in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In the winter, hunger forces excess animals out of the garden to Montana, where they are sometimes harvested by the Indians of Arizona Niz Perce under a US treaty under Lincoln. Lincoln signed the Congressional Act which authorized the continental rail and began to slaughter buffaloes.
