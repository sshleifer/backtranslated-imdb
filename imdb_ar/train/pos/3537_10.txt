Game James Bond This is the best bond game played out in my life, it's my favorite James Bond game yet because it is: <br /> <br /> The tasks in this game are really fun so it can be very challenging making it more fun to play the tasks it has Lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are fantastic, as the car missions enjoy a lot of movement and are really fun to play. Sound through the actors is really good and Sean Connery is also influenced by James Bond's voice in the way the band looks great because it looks just like Sean Connery when James Bond played in films and the other character looks great in the same format in the film. The graphics are very good in this James Bond game. The game also follows the film pretty much but not all the time but most of the time it does is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********** ***** *****
