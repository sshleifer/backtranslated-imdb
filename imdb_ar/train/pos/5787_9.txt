Much has been made in this episode (just like most episodes of the Twilight Zone), such as the incredibly sexy "military uniform" for women. Some things are incredible, such as easy availability of clean water. However, keep in mind the year that was made at this time and time, and you'll quickly understand why this episode is so distinctive as you see. He has a nice sense of hope, something missing from lots of Twilight areas, plus an interesting female character (although she rarely speaks), another rare thing in the Twilight area. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, fills more emotions and drama than most of today's two-hour movies. It is wonderful to see two people become American icons early in their careers.
