I never heard this film before watching it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good actor, I decided to get it. Michael Williams (Nicholas Cage) Basically in Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, Wayne Mal Brown (Jay T-Welch) of Pleasantville, gets a large sum of money, mistaken because he had a huge success hired to kill his wife Susan Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Susan, and after making him a counter, decides he needs to leave. When Wayne realizes his identity, Michael chases after he shoots a big gun, even riding a car with a night of Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get even more complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the successful man who was wrong, and is falling fast. He returns to Susan, knowing they are in danger, planning to leave the town together and add another complication to each other. Before they leave, Suzanne insists on going and stealing a large sum of money in the safe. Of course, things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lynn follow her, and now she is forced to do so, and Win connects them to go and get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, and Michael and Susan get a moving train together, but obviously they are more interested in money, and they get what they deserve too. He was starred as Craig Ree as Jim, Fance Johnson as Johnson and Timothy Carhart as deputy of Matt Gritak and Dwight Joacham as truck driver and Robert Abel as Howard. All the performances, except perhaps the lame buil, are all good and wonderful, and I got a very good feeling from the movie Noir about the black comedy movie. very good!
