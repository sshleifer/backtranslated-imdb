In today's world of digital fabrication, no computer can replace the actor and writer. Unfortunately, this kind of "character-driven" movie is extremely rare these days. Duvall's performance as well as James Earl Jones is true to the expectations of their high audience. I wonder if this movie has been made for television? He has a "close-up" personal quality of the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the presentations are all fantastic. The only thing that prevents him from being a cinematic masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer, but beautiful pictures are not all. How can talents such as Jones and Duval continue to produce such remarkable work in an age in which actors demand digitization?
