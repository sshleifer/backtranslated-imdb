The spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic deconstructing this film in a 10 o'clock news review, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who it was, or any local Omaha news bulletin conducted the review, but the critic insisted that this film was too startling for Nebraska's regular church-going. They showed a scene from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Anne Margaret when she is swimming in the swimming pool. Glover's character praises the extent of her beautiful body and so on, using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit. I was hooked. There was one problem though. I was only 13 years old at the time and I had to wait a year until I came out on the cable. Let's just say, it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If there is ever a guilty pleasure, this movie is it. To call this film corruption would be a great understatement. The film revolves around a successful businessman who was blackmailed by three young men who stumble after an affair with a young woman. Roy Cheddar, who is more effective than ever before, plays the role of the poor man who wanted a small shot and now finds himself at the mercy of three great evil men. John Glower's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. It is hilarious and sometimes funny, always on the brink of insanity. Then, there is the character of Robert Tripure (the beautiful name, by the way!) Leo who is clearly above his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a coward, sweating, cowardly, running a peep show with live models. Then, Clarence Williams III has the role of Bobby Shi, a bosom sociologist who is feared by everyone for good reason. Who can forget Vanity's wake-up call with a giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of recognizing what he is facing, Cheddar runs the tables on this crawl and controls the situation, and that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is brutally played, with all the members of the team being shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I like this movie so much. Really must creep me, but they do not. Maybe that's because all these characters are interesting, and the story takes a lot of chances that most of the movies will not try today. It is frightening to think that adult filmmaking may involve more than a few people like Glover, who sets out in Los Angeles looking for a problem. Just thinking his voice is enough to make me chuckle. "Hello sports, I wish you a wonderful day!" <br /> <br /> This movie contains a lot of exercises, wonderful cars, wonderful dialogue (like the line in my opening statement), and decent representation. Much of the inscription by the real life porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy walking around in a hot tub with two chickens in a party scene in Glover Place. <br /> <br /> Another thing to add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wonderful! Travolta did the right to marry Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that vanity becomes naked at some point before becoming a reborn Christian. And Anne Margaret. What you can say about it is the perfect American beauty. 9 of 10 Stars! <br /> <br /> So says the Hound. <br /> <br /> Added February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
