When you see this movie, you start to realize what the largely untapped origin of the late Dudley Moore was. There must be more than ten movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was already a first-class talent before going to Hollywood, as a comedian and musician. But is often remembered for his association with Peter Cook, on television and in an indifferent British film or film. Perhaps the best of these was "dazzling". <br /> <br /> He has always tended to be overcome by Cook, who is jealous and repugnant who has contributed to his partnership and enabled Moore to realize his true potential in America. Arthur is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really wonderful movie. Moore can not deny the clown as a drunkard. The script is perfectly suited for his style with a lot of ridiculous and almost surreal conversation explorations. There is something so British about him that I was really surprised that he found an appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian after the same style, tends to draw a vacuum. Moore's weakness, which is almost childlike, is very sweet. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minelli and John Gilgod tend to play direct roles against him, but they still have some excellent vocabulary. John Gilgod in particular recognizes his satirical and erotic power which is a treasure to watch. He always steals any scene that is well worth the Oscars. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comedy role. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up film entitled "Arthur 2 - On The Rocks". Never reach the same fun levels as this fun, but it is still pretty good. Gilgod only gets the appearance of a veil at first and as a ghost. It's darker. There are some interesting self-search. It would be disappointing to see Arthur first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in Dudley after these two matches. He eventually returned to Britain, depressed and seemed to die. <br /> <br /> But Arthur is a sample of what might be. We can only imagine the other great films he was supposed to make. <br /> <br /> You've missed Dudley.
