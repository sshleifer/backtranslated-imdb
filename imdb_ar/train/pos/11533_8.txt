This film, which begins with an interesting opening of two hot floors filled in the back of a car carrying drivers, has a rather strange little character to boot. The group of seven representatives (although one girl does not hang around to count the number of people, which is unfortunate because the number of deaths is already too small) is extreme. Our story is centered around adolescents in concerts in the desert (a strange but effective choice of preparation) ), Who is chased by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. It precedes many vehicle-inspired cutting tools so far ("The Ride", "Joy Ride" and "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer car itself becomes a vicious opponent. The killer itself is absolutely creepy, and we find solace in the very popular heroine of Jennifer McAllister (see the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil murderer in all blacks, while our charismatic heroine wears white, as slim and amazing as possible). Bill Crain has some really cool things to do with his camera, some fantastic tricks on the screen, and the cast tries to do their best. There are enough low number to satisfy college fans, plus enough T & A from a couple of girls to please T & A fans. Overall, this click is very low and is widely searched in the world of vulgar movies because it is very rare to find them in the video. Highly recommended.
