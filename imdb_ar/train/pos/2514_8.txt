I voted for this film because of some minor childish flaws. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! It's amusing to say less. The scenes of photography are ridiculous, and I think Gaket (who wrote the book) takes a lot of "matrix obsession" in it. It seems that their enemies are standing there ... waiting to get shot. However, this film touches and always makes me cry. She has a lot of great humor in it that makes me laugh as well. Gackt is a wonderful actor I have to say .. It shows a lot of feelings. This was the first time that Hyde had acted well. The role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is very wonderful. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this film. do not miss! You will regret it!
