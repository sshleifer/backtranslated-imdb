I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the internet and I think Cinderella 2 (plus 3) is a nice and very funny sequel to all - kids and adults ... like me, I am 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find an informative movie, which shows lessons about the sincerity of your self and your heart's attention. I thought it contained a wonderful animation, and the voice was very good sound; the songs performed by Brooke Allison too. Since this movie has been divided into three stories / stories, my favorite of the three is a story when Jaq became the mouse, a one day man, thanks to Fairy Godmother and her charm.
