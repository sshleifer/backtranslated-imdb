When it was introduced in America in 1972, "The Night Stalker" became the highest rating made specifically for T.V. The film is in history. Based on the unpublished Jeff Rice novel, he recounted how a reporter for a fear investigation named Karl Kolchak (the late Darren McGaven) discovered a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When I arrived on British television four years later, it did not have exactly the same effect, but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning, as it really was. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things I have seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know about the "The Night Strangler" until a decade later. It seems that I.T.V. , Which showed films "Kolchak", decided to move the separate series; felt that "Barnaby Jones" Championship Buddy Ebsen to be more equal, and in any case, may confuse viewers between "Kolchak" and "Kojak"! For years, my only source of information about the exhibition was an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 was screened as part of a late-night Friday series dedicated to the Rude Mystery Train hosted by Richard O'Brien. "Kolchak" found himself rubbing shoulders like "brain eaters" and "earth vs. spider". The opening headlines, the removal of the Kolchak siren, and the closing credits were cut ... Well, there was nothing. <br /> <br /> The first episode that was shown was "Werewolf". I can not say I'm very impressed, but stuck to it, I'm glad I did it! <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see her in 1974. I could have loved myself. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder they launched the imagination of Chris Carter. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage was the display, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was personal to every man, wearing eccentric clothes, somewhat conservative. It was extraordinary for what it was "Colombo". The late Simon Oakland was very impressive like Colchac's manager Tony Vincenzo. The scripts are cleverly filled and gorgeous. I found myself enjoying the program for humor rather than horror. When the 20 episodes ended, I felt pleased. <br /> <br /> X Files came several years later and filled the void - but to some extent. I wanted the return of Kolchak and Vincenzo. I am happy because the presentation did not inspire at all. Lola Auckland was not the same. <br /> <br /> I have Rice's books now and read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King identified the first (in his book "Danse Macabre") because it is as good as anything he wrote. <br /> <br /> Well, even some monsters were barely on the latest model, but what about it? "Kolchak" completely missed the original. What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - Horror Episode in the Highlands - Worst Episode - "The Guard"
