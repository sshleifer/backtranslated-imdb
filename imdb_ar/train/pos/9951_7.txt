If you ever wonder why they did not porno with a conspiracy, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong credit for making every effort to capitalize on this idea and to use such a powerful and powerful actor to put a strong name behind him. On the other hand, it is also quickly apparent that there is no dialogue between more than 15 or 20 seconds between sex scenes together. These people simply can not act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to an ironically ridiculous). <br /> <br /> However, I have given it 7 because it was a nice attempt and there did not seem to be much try to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more attempts like this. Maybe someday we will see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
