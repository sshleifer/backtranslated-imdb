I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a story of excellent political excitement about something that had never happened before - an officer in the Secret Service gets worse and takes part in an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "The House of Garrison", they think he is a mole but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally flawed client who has a relationship with the First Lady! Because he does so, he is unable to perform an acceptable lie detector test and this makes him suspect that he is number one when a conspiracy to kill the president is detected. <br /> <br /> The "garrison" is forced to proceed. But at the same time is still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I do not always care about the people he plays with but he is an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is equally important (at least here) like his fellow SS chief who is chasing Douglas until he is convinced he is telling the truth. When the two of them work together in the end to discover the plot and then stop it if possible. Scammers are interesting, too, by the way. Also, I have never seen - and will never be - a vision of a first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> This is just a flick of work that entertains from start to finish. Are there holes in it? Of course certainly; maybe a number of them, the reason to see a lot of important comments. However, it is unfairly eliminated. It's not smart enough for geniuses here on this site. My advice: chill out, just enjoy the trip and enjoy all the excitement and movement. Yes, you get a little Rambo nest at the end, but you get high scores for entertainment ..... which is what the movies are about.
