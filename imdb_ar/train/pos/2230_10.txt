I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 years old when I thought it was aired on television in 1983. All I can remember is that it was about a teenage girl, alone, after she survived an airplane crash and escaped from the Amazon. I remember that people were looking for her (her family) and she knew how to take care of herself - she tells the story and remembers it clearly when she learned that the insects were under her skin. I do not remember much about this film, and I want to see it again - if this is the same - and if you have a copy, can you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'll be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It was aired on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I had my own problems and this film had a big impact on me. thank you In advance!
