A joke about Bonanza should be about how powerful a woman is to get involved with any Cartwright man. After all Ben Cartwright had three times widowed with the son of every marriage. Any woman involved with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe will end up in the end because we could not get rid of the formula of widows and three children who started this classic Western TV. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Bonanza had been done today, the book would have revolved around female characters who came and graduated from Cartwright's life. People have relationships, some are good, some are not good, they are just lives. We are less demanding than our heroes today, so if the relationship with someone goes south, we do not have to kill the character to keep the nobility alive. But this is whether Bonanza is over today. <br /> <br /> But we still expect a lot from our Western champions and Panenza although it took some time to take over and change the viewing time of NBC certainly helped, the secret was the success of Bonanza's noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his prominent sons. Ben Cartwright was the ideal TV dad in any genre you wanted to name. He spent his whole life in the hard work of building this enormous Ponderosa which spread to his three children. All the children were different in their personalities, but they all came together. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights has become an American institution. I dare more than one person who cares about this family more than Kinds. Only the popularity of Bonanza in the union attests to it. <br /> <br /> Bern Roberts wrote as the eldest son of the program. Rumor has it that he did not care about the dignified figures of Cartwright, who felt bound by holiness. Perhaps if it were done now, he would have preferred it better in the way I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people have three successful TV shows at their expense. Landon also has a motorway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where it has creative control. Little Joe was the smallest and most wonderful, but the most romantic in Cartwarts. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. The show continued with the younger boys, but when Big Dan Balker left, the heart came out of Bonanza. Other characters were added by then, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright young Mitch Vogel. But the great fort, loyal, but a little thicker was more easily liked than the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left a very large gap in that family. <br /> <br /> So Cartwright Bonderosa has passed through history. I've got a real taste of how America took Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real city of Virginia. Nothing looks like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, where you see Ponderosa on the map when you open credits, there is a Cartwright house, where the group was preserved and opened as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the Farmhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> If it is not real, it will be.
