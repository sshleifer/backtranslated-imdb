I did not expect much, and to be honest, I did not like this film for the first time but I watched it again and realized it was wonderful. Sure, it's a joking movie but it's a funny joke. <br /> <br /> Someone posted it could be better written and could be. I think this film had the potential to be my cousin Finney. But with a terrifying host rather than a lawyer. Unfortunately, it is a missed opportunity. Writing a bit more can be a classic. The children are not sufficiently exploited and there is no reason to prevent them from reaching Elvira. Regardless of obvious reasons. It was wonderful to see their relationships thrive. I know it's comedy, but there are subtle differences between good movies and great movies. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always fun and attractive. Not to mention flirty. Every time you smile too. Hard to hit the film when the main character is very charming. It's really magic, do not let it seem to fool you to think it's a bit. Well it is. But it is nice. The type of person you left takes care of your children. She will not let her cook for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I recommend her experience. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a wonderful collection of breasts. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
