It's fitting in a music day to get your heart pumping, and no one can do it better than Little Richard. A man can sing the drawers for ladies and know rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look to Lyon for a specific description, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This was a wonderful biography where we saw Little Richard wrestling with his father and with his church and with himself for what he was. He won the battle and no one has his voice or style.
