This documentary drama is what you expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully filmed, masked and convincingly written well in a calculated and desirable way that Hollywood got rid of in the thirties, and accuracy accurately. It stands out as a film of the genre that surpasses his portrayal of Native American culture (or, more aptly for his Canadian development, the "First Nations" culture) and a "black robe" as a fascinating piece of the boat country and culture (here, around 1934). The ideal image of the drama is derived from Archie Gray Gray, a Scottish who grew up in Hastings, England, by his cousins ​​who became obsessed with the stories of the American Indians in his childhood until he disappeared to Canada and became a fisherman and adopted his son Ojibway. He was a man who unsuccessfully had the habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides. <br /> <br /> Neither seemed to think much about it because he was also a very charming and strange figure. One of his wives (one more intelligent than him, according to most novels) paid him fame as an early writer and patron to protect the wild northern country, and this is at the heart of Ateneboro's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Gallipo (as the wife of Gray Bonnie Bonnie) is interesting, and if it is not fatal, it is nonetheless very moving. A good movie when you need some time from the crowd is impressive.
