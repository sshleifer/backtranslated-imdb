Not surprisingly, Bossi later developed a pimple in the sinus cavity, and this film was also a bad decision, but I completely enjoyed it. The first 5 minutes is the most inspirational 5 minutes in any film; boring, bad dial, and then, with Spiderman's attitude, Bossi screams on the best line in any movie created ... "The worst nightmare for you!" Some of the eggs of the egg are made and he laughs hard. This line resonates well, but it sits on the famous line of "Hello, I'm Batman". Other classic moments are Busee's preoccupation with the people he says were killed by his former CIA partner ... which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible by a slow-moving retrograde sequence that makes the dry paint control look exciting). There is an ashtray on the young, punches on the face, "This was not my fault and you know it!" Well, his footage shows he is missing the bad guy and hits his mate, so ... other moments must be screaming loudly that his former friend was dropping a bomb on the ground to enable him to escape - a plan that defies everyone's logic, physics, and absurdity. Finally, when McBain jumps from Thunderblast during the intense guerilla war and starts jogging and faces a small hurdle, I almost am. Some of the best works of Busey are quite, rented or bought today "butthorn!" My typical vote is 10 (on the stool scale).
