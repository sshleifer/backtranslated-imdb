This short film that inspired the full length feature soon - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious movie that contradicts similar cartoons produced by many writers. The short film tells the role of Edward the Spatula, who later participates in his work against evil spoons. This introduction offers some laughable content near the beginning, but hardly exists for the rest of the feature. This 15-minute film absorbs some exotic comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately, there is not much else. The plot being prepared does not have time to show it. But it certainly follows better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film deserves to be seen at least several times. Take it as it is, and do not expect a deep story.
