I would definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very attractive reading (unintended pun intended). It is not very difficult to read those who do not read so much so do not be afraid! It seems that the book captures the passion for relationships over the film and the film will be more logical after reading the book. After growing up in Melbourne, I can really relate to this book and film. Very few Australian writers were in the 1970s, so very little has been documented about the way women live in an urban city in Australia during this period or in the classroom. It is a precious piece of Melbourne history. It is shameful to be documented as a kind of soft pornographic film. It's as far away as the other reviewer mentioned, please do not read the DVD cover, it does not represent what the film is about at all. Those who rent a movie based on this description will not disappoint you. Just remember that this movie was created in 1982, so do not expect Hollywood to show more than theatrical act these days. That's what I like about it. It is also wonderful to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role. She is as wonderful as Nora, and it is wonderful to see her act as she is, because if you are close to her age she will remember her better in her work at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew that she hid this talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression. Australian classic story!
