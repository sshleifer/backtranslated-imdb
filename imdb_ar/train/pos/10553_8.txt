... from this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams worked together on one film? This film begins with a touch from Brazil ... When the story moves, at a certain point, directly into the twilight zone ... nothing new is offered, but nothing else ... nothing very enjoyable! When Dave and Andrew begin to explore their new environment, the film becomes really fun ... Bouncing the heads? Well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway ... this movie, Imho, was the biggest surprise at FantasyFilmFest this year ... <br /> <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher Natalie gave this simple and strange but very distinctive design, making it difficult to locate the story or its timeless ... timeless way ...
