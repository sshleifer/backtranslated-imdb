In my opinion, this is a very romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the father's wife (the voice of Lucille La Veran) was really demonic. You should watch the movie if you want to find out why. On the other hand, although she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (the voice of Ellen Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the scenery was nice, the staff were well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I finish this, I would like to say that all the participants in this film have performed well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this romantic Disney gift to all of you who have never seen it. I have had fun, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, get back with a friend, and watch it.
