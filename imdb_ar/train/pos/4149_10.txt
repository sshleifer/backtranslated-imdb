When I read some comments on the message boards here, I expected this movie to be a complete disappointment - but when I saw it, I could not stop laughing! I officially became my new favorite film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what all the hatred is about here, perhaps because this movie was not there before. I'm perplexed to label a fully paid comedy. Many comics will be represented by one or two in the foreground, but there will be plenty of male supporting characters. Almost all of them - except Seth Myers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett - were successful. All the actresses presented very funny performances (especially Missy Pyle) from a strange and beloved script. <br /> <br /> The magic of this film seems to me to be in his feminist message: acceptance of who you are, female success in the public sphere, the power of female friendships and the breaking of gender roles. Nevertheless, all prominent figures face a challenge as they try to be more "fun" with their feminist values ​​and who have known themselves. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle suggested that this film missed a theatrical show because of its full female representation and the absence of a great name representative to get the studios behind it, and I must agree. Everyone has been recommended to this film because I loved it and I think it's a shame that the comedy that celebrates female roles has not been widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind or comedy-centered love of females.
