I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I could see this film, I did not really know anything about the Beatles. I did not even know all their names! All I know is that they had a lot of fans, they had some albums that some claim to be the best ever, they collapsed, and John married from Yoko Ono, and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, but MTV. However, for one reason or another I decided to watch it, I do not expect much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it so much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with minor tone chaos. This is very important, because the John and Paul talk is the whole movie largely, although they are moved abroad to explore more possibilities and to watch. Jared Harris and Eddin Quinn offer good overall performances. <br /> <br /> The end was also very smart. I enjoyed how you liked the film about SNL performance, then slapped you on the head and made you realize that it would be better if they left it, and finished it well. Perhaps my favorite moment is the scene on the surface. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It is a very good way to settle your curiosity about what would have happened if, after six years of separation, Paul had just appeared on the threshold of John. Perhaps this is the main reason for my viewing of this film, a curious settlement to see who the Beatles really are and what could have happened to them after the collapse.
