I must say that this TV movie was a work that really showed the extent of Melissa Juan's talent. We are now used to seeing it in the sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon, where Sabrina fans will see MJH shine in drama. We have seen as we have seen on Sabrina now for 5 years, so giving viewers the taste of their much unused talent will be an added advantage. Melissa plays a good role in achieving this goal of her parents to "get away" to be with the man you love. One thing that will be noticed by all Sabrina viewers, Melissa works with David Lacher in this, before taking over Josh's role in Sabrina. So it would be good to see this now whenever it was broadcast again. We hope that MJH will get some good roles in movies or even in more television films, such as Kellie Martin, who has always starred in television films. Lots of unused talent waiting for the statue when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
