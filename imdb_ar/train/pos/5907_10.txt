This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India, and to some extent I saw the lives of the villagers. The peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie reflects exactly the same thing. Full credit for director and actor. They did an excellent job. I just wonder how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria in which films are selected. The money that makes the difference or having some big names in the film is what makes the difference. <br /> <br /> We hope to see more movies like this in the future.
