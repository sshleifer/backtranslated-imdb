This movie is one I highly recommend. Is about a boy named Stanley Jelnas (Xia Lipov) who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to the Green Lake camp, a detention center for boys. There, he is forced to drill holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. While there, he meets with other boys in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and ZigZag). They all dig, not "to build a trait", but to find the treasure of Kate Barlow outlaw. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, about himself, and more about digging holes. I give this film 9.5, because, I'm picky when it comes to books for movies, (I want to follow the movie exactly book). But, it is still good.
