All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I've always loved. When I was a kid, I was watching this every day. It is taken lightly if you look at the IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad film, as many say, it's a very good film. This is good and your kids might like it. Although G was rated, some parents may find this somewhat violent. It's actually a pretty dark story, where gangsters are like gangsters who are involved in gambling, extortion and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie who has fled the pound, killed by his old friend, and goes to heaven, but ends up returning to earth. Many young children who watch this movie may feel as though they are watching a big movie for children. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that may scare young children, but I'm sure they will work fine. Every time I watch this movie, that reminds me when I was a little boy. I'm sure everyone who has a movie reminds them when they're younger, this is the movie that makes me feel this way. The performances by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film in which a young girl named Judith Parsi participated. Unfortunately, she was killed at an early age, and this is a disgrace because she has a lot of potential and has not done so. "Now that I know her story, I can no longer watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds very sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is fantastic, the voice action is fantastic, the story is good, but it's a little different from many other children's movies. Adults also picture it, but if you are a child, or if you grow up with this movie as a child, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching it.
