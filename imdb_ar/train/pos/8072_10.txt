Wonderful and memorable, in a stunning atmosphere, and act brilliantly by everyone. <br /> <br /> I can not really understand what kind of people take advantage of this masterpiece and give the vote as 8 (and 9 votes!) <br /> <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, John Ford. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next, although largely returning. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. It's worth 12.
