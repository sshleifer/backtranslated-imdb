Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck, where the local professor told her she had the power - trying to get her to read Nietzsche - says that the books did nothing good for her. Soon, we discovered that her father was floundering out to local Politico and others. She finally had enough and moved into the big city. We follow her career from men until he succeeds in an international bank. The dialogue is very easy because it's about time and it was one of the last movies to be released before it produced a Hollywood self-production icon. Look for John Wayne, a Stanwyck young man, as one of the victims of Stanwyck. Part of the Hollywood Prohibited Collection - Watch the expanded version - DVD contains both versions as well as Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting film that predicts impressive roles in the future will be played by Stanwyck in the film era. B +
