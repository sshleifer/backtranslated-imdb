Wonderful! a lot of fun! This may have been a bit for ordinary American children, and it really is an extension to the publication of this film as a child. This movie reminded me a lot of bandit time - very Terry Gilliam all the way. Although the overall narrative is quite straight forward, Miike still throws in a lot of Surreal moments and Escuel's Bonwell. The whole first act runs from scene to scene with the natural family life of the main child / hero, with a spirit world and more evil. Although the end has a vague aspect commonly found in the work of Miike, the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the message of human folly against war / revenge, are very moving. As an obsessive and creative enthusiast like the other great Miike movies, instead of over-torturing and carrying, gives us an infinite number of monsters and yokai from an imaginative Japanese folk through CG and stuffed dolls in a multi-faceted adventure. F'n rad, one of the best Mike!
