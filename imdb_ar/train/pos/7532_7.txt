New Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) is 5 years after the last episodes of Batman: the Animated Series (B: TAS) and is broadcast only for 24 episodes. This is not a shocking show, but it is not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I will start with all the things that I did not think are very good. <br /> <br /> First thing, the animation itself: long and long, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did this too, but was drawn on the dark palate, the sky color was more pessimistic, In this show, the color of the sky was very bright. Everything looks like any other children's show and does not look as unique as Batman: TAS did in his dark and brilliant artistic style on Gotham. The technical style is fine, but Batman does not remind me anymore. Each character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles, making characters appear less human. In the original string (B: TAS), characters look more like versions drawn from real people. The animation may be more consistent here than B: TAS, but it certainly is not good. <br /> <br /> Next: Some episodes seem to have been overlooked and very childish, but some themes are stronger than in B: TAS (a two-faced attempt to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 and some bad guys get some very harsh treatment). This leads me to my next point. <br /> <br /> Because this is supposed to happen in the future as well as the recent episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many villains face their demise or leave forever. The Joker is located in the Exhaust Tower at an industrial facility (although it will later return to the Justice League Animated Series) ; The cat moves away from France and leaves Batman, etc. ... just because the series is over does not mean that they have to get rid of some wonderful characters! The bad guys' motives are very bad. There is no! In B: TAS, we know that these bad guys are mentally tortured and that their lives are destructive, and that's why they act the way they do. In this show, the bad guys commit crimes to advance the story. It seems as though Batman does not even care to save all the remaining minds of the people he is fighting, but to make them sound meaningless. This Batman is a colder, more frivolous version of the character, but since he has been doing this for years, I can see why he is strong. <br /> <br /> Then, the redesigned characters' models: it's awful. Gordon retreated for 100 pounds ... Is he sick? Many of the bad guys look like STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the worst). Although I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is almost the same, and Ivy (which is more hot now) has a pale green complexion. <br /> <br /> With many flaws in the series, some of the episodes are wonderful - Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware the Creeper, Night Girls Abroad, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight, and I'm never afraid is my favorite here , in my opinion. All Batman's moves in the Superman Animated series were also great. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part of this show is how creative creators say they love the animation more than the original. On the DVD features of the original Batman Animated Series, they talk about how proud they are of the art, how difficult it is to move some characters, but they finally succeed (the hard animation needed to move Clayface, for example). On DVD features of New Batman Adventures, creators say "To Hell with B: TAS, this is a new and new experience, looks better and we love the way we've promoted it forever!" (Well, that's an exaggeration). When the creators moved away from the amazing technique of B: TAS, it really bothered me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad show, but I still do not like it like the original animated series. At least the show does not speak to its audience, and for that reason, I still commend it. Although some of the episodes in this new series are wonderful and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: the Animated Series and Justice League: the Animated Series are great follow-up shows for Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, so give them a look as well.
