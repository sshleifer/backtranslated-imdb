While reading the remaining comments for this presentation, I could only point out that a large proportion of the reviewers either did not actually see any episodes of the show either voluntarily or voluntarily. The thing about Kerching! It is a show for children, for children, it is clear that if you are older you will look like a cowardly coward and maybe a fool. I even found one person saying that the groups were stupid, but I remember when I was eight, wondering why Taj had put IKEA ice cube molds on his wall, and I also wondered if my parents would let me stick to each other (they did not). Yes, it may be annoying, and the acting may be better, and some characters do things that are really strange to her hair, but as children have shown, I value it 10/10. Compared to the things they broadcast in their place today, well, let's just say I wish to re-broadcast. DVD Release, Anyone?
