If you delete the first 20 minutes or so from this movie, you will leave a great comedy. As it is, I still find it a very good film, which is not easy given the coma I gave in the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a bleak start that was not remotely funny, or even optimistic. As soon as things get smarter, you have a comedy that continues to stand after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their previous works.
