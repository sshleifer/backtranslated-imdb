I had a fun time viewing this picture, and was pleasantly surprised by its most enthusiastic features. Initially, the film was made cheaply through its cardboard collections, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The representation of the very poor (the instrumentalists), barely professional (Herb Evers as a leading man), Gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as assistant to Kurt) to the first class with Virginia Laith in the title role as a lifeless victim of her will to science and the passion of her fiance. Although scripting is very good and the dialogue wonderful for a movie of this kind. There are many problems about the role science and medicine play in our lives and what their limits should be. This movie is a film thinking in many ways. However, do not be too fooled for her real intention. It is a ludicrous story about a man obsessed with his medical abilities and wants to merge his dead girlfriend's head with the ideal body, creating an ideal woman for a man who has the best in the body and spirit. Another very bright aspect of the film is sax music, which resonates strongly every time a doctor roams the city in search of female beauty.
