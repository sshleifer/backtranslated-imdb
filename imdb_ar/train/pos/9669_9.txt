After reading the original play, I thought that adapting to the screen would be more difficult than it was. Donal McCann offers a great one-time performance like Public Gar, an overdraft that appears publicly on the screen through his alternate (but invisible to others) private alternative - Gar Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays excellent "spiral balls" that Gar is only able to communicate with his feelings. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth leasing if you can find them. (Maybe not available outside of Ireland and the UK)
