Henry Hall of Hull Hartley was an independent film master and certainly his best. It has a tremendous personal depth, a subtle and complex dialogue, an excellent end, and emotional captivity. I remember pausing several times during the first viewing to understand what I was seeing and feeling. Henry Full was a full film from start to finish, and he did not need anything. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard about Faye Grimm. Fei was not one of the main characters in the first film, and seemed to exist more alarmingly and in the real world to force her brother Simon to deal with him as he cooked. In her own film, Faye matures herself, although her maturity takes a completely different path. Simon moved from semi-monotonous isolation to a somewhat ingenious genius. Fay begins her adult journey as an immature child, completely natural, spoiled, and responding to the ridiculous circumstances attack to become mature, perfectly natural, experienced and without any advantages. It deals with problems in the way that any person deals, with determination, little thought, and tired disdain. As Simon learns to control his mind, Fay learns to control her feelings. <br /> <br /> The movie contains many elements that fondly remember from its luster, but it varies greatly in the tone of most of the film. Henry has shown you a cruel, boring, and ignorant world that contradicts Simon's inner passion and creativity. In Faye Grimm, the world is a dynamic, crazy and emotional place that shows the lightness of its small life and, on the contrary, reveals the wise inner woman that was not nurtured or nurtured by her equally vulnerable mother. <br /> <br /> The film is in two parts, the first dealing with the beginning of the Fi conflict and its hardening after authoritarian hostility, and the second dealing with its battle to soften just enough to restore Henry. In the beginning, Henry Fole's fans may find themselves wondering how the movie could be considered a sequel, and think that it is the next to follow an intense film such as the Alien of the game of espionage and physical comedy. But this is where the accuracy of Faye Grim lies. The journey is about Fei, and as I said before, it's about finding a life-giving mentality in chaos, not creative chaos in a rigid order. Parker Bossi is an excellent actress who picks up Hull Hartley's tongue in the humor of the cheek. Perhaps Lunison has overcome us with her emotional commitment to the role, allowing Parker to play the role of straight and comedian against the live comedy that is similar to the stage in which it occurs. <br /> <br /> With Henry entering the picture, the movie begins to take a sober turn. Hull Hartley films are all plays, and each play must come complete. In the end, the newly developed Faye character is shown, and her integrity is the seed of her time with Henry the deadly killer, whose passionate honesty and passion gives a spark in anyone she meets. <br /> <br /> An excellent film does not outweigh Henry Bean, but it shows through the Hull group that subtle nuances in his art are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think anyone who hits this movie has not missed the idea in a mile (especially the precision of Parker Posey), but he could not have been interested in Henry Fowl.
