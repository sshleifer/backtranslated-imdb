Kazan's early film Nawar won the Oscars. Some reviews here deal with unusual details and lengths about the movie and its icon, and evaluate it to a very high degree. I can almost see where they came from. But I would prefer a more harmonious approach to a long-forgotten film that seems to have been filmed without a budget and in a semi-documentary style. The pulmonary plague is soft on the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and city detectives (Douglas) to arrest the main carrier (Balance). The film is moody, filmed in blatant black and white, and is very well served by the sites. Widmark is great as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, illness equals crime) and just enjoy chasing. It is not always easy to watch a movie like this now. We are now in this new century, as it has a certain short-lived model (post-World War II until the early 1950s) and is unlikely to be of interest to the exhibitors. Watch Movie. For those who will watch this for the first time, they sit down hard at the end of the big chase. It's another thing, and frankly I do not know how they pictured some of it. I can say that it took a long time to film the final as did 90% of the film.
