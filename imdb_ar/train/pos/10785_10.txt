I saw it when I was young and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Missy mice where cute. Susan Bond as Doodle and Sandra de Heidek in the role of Snodel where Hilarys. Karen Butcher-Tate was an interesting Proster. Borel Ross Little Rabbit Fu Fu funny. Gregory Donafon in the role of Cayeso was wonderful. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat a lot of candy. What is sad is that Little Bunny Foo Foo who micks Mice Mice on his head and then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo some wishes and then turn into Gun. This story revolves around the transition of Lisa, Snowdoll and Dudel to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent, children will love this show, new words and songs and watch them play.
