Although re-listing part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once amusing, only "Iphigenia" with the glowing Irene Pappas was fantastic. Unfolding in a natural environment with Greek actors speaking their own language imparts this originality. I have had the chance to meet with this film on one of the many film channels in DirecTV interested in spite of my focus problems. There is no glamor or bling in this film, it's just a rich story that actors tell in a flawless way so that one feels like they are sitting on a real family in turmoil. I think Homer, if he does, will be proud of that. <br /> <br /> JLH
