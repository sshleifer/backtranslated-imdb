"The Bourne Ultimatum" starts with a reckless chase in the middle and explodes in a pulsating fashion from there, while Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, a superstar) follows the brains behind the black operations of the CIA that turned him into the ideal killer in a last-ditch attempt to find his true identity. David Strathairn glacier was added as a "man behind the curtain" to the returning cast including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stills (nonexistent). <br /> <br /> Like the second entry in a series, I wished Lou Paul Bolgeras' hand-shaking camera would remain steady for at least a few minutes of downtime. However, it is a perfect way to capture the tense and suffocating feelings of intimate scenes from hand to hand and work equally well in chase scenes that are mostly walking and across rooftops with a large car pile sometimes - over. Part of the fun series Bourne is the constant mobility and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Born films seem to exist in a kind of hyperbole reality that is full of technology-based magic. It does not make sense for everyone to be seen in the right place at the right time, but I'd be cursed if it was not an explosion to see them get there. <br /> <br /> With the absence of the author, who was emotional and the participation of Franca Potenti, she tries to create a romantic relationship between Damon and Stiles, but she is an actress with a very empty face and never leads to anything. However, this can be tolerated, because unlike "identity" and "superiority", this "final warning" reveals everything and finally learns the truth of Born's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying ending to the series, and if they have any good feeling, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.
