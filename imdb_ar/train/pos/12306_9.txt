The late Chinese phantom Leslie Cheung, the late Ling Choi Sen, the bankrupt tax collector who decides to spend the night in an abandoned temple, meets and falls for a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost forced to seduce the victims with the evil spirit of a tree feeding on "chi" (life force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her a proper burial. With the help of the crazy swordsman Yin (Wu Ma), a crazy Taoist monk, he succeeds in defeating the spirit of the tree, but he must also fight a battle in Hell against the evil Lord Black, whom Tsing is scheduled to marry. <br /> <br /> The first Hong Kong film I saw was not a purely martial art movement, a Chinese ghost story opened up to an incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical world inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, innocent and disgruntled heroes, the sword of monks The Taoists, the brutal spirits and the dark masters of the underworld; they immediately fell in love with the abundance, vitality, humor, creativity and visual excellence of the film. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, this amazing film is still one of the finest examples of the kind of movies I've seen? An amazing masterpiece that blends brilliantly with horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With superb guidance from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing from David Wu, stunning cinematography, a full range of fantasy special effects (including a terrifying killer's tongue, a monster of claws and multiple flying heads!), A completely memorable and enjoyable experience from start to End.
