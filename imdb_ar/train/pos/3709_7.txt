An on-screen adaptation of John Grisham's story deserves the Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman revolves around the last director he directed to deal with anything common. But this southern fried boiler is very good. Although it is not among the best of the Altman films, it is certainly not among the films he made that make you scratch your head and wonder what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman had raised his hat to the mysterious thriller without any tone before, in his 1973 film The Long Goodbye. "Ginger Man" is not in a good place like this film, but it holds a pretty good picture of its own. Kenneth Branagh is a cocky lawyer who finds himself in the act of murder after being involved with an agent (Ambith Davids) who enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckold father (Robert Duval). The film is located in Savannah, Georgia, as the tropical storm approaches, giving the film a repressive atmosphere that I like so much. The twists and turns toward the end of the film are more interesting and interesting, and Altman himself proves that not everyone has experience shooting, but in general the film is not a bad addition to Alan Altman. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey Jr., Darrell Hannah, Tom Bringer and Pameck Jansen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
