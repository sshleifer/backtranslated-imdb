Much like the comic duo titled "The Sunshine Boys" after thirty years of classic forgotten. He barely mentions other fantastic comedies in the 1970s. This has no meaning given the unique privacy of this film, and probably the best that Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathew plays Willie Clark, who once was half of the legendary Foodville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old single girl who can not get a job in a commercial potato chip advertisement . Surely his nephew and his cousin Ben (Richard Benjamin) are sure that he is able to get a job if Willie agrees not to share it with his bizarre partner Louis (George Burns) to celebrate the BBC - TV nostalgia for the business world. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what happens in "Sunshine Boys" in the form of sculptures, from the beginning when a series of films from the 1920s showed many artists long before they appeared to accompany "Be A Clown "From Cool. Then there is the current film set in Manhattan, where there are wide trousers and wide polyester ties. The periods in Willie's glorious mess collide with Manhattan's apartment, with framed pictures and caricatures of celebrities who have long died of walls in popular newspapers and empty grocery bags in Zabar. If you are alive in the 1970s like me, you may feel like you are in this apartment. <br /> <br /> Obviously Willie lives there for a long time. Sleeps in front of the TV when the boiler boils in the other room. Wake up and pick up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" pause. "It does not matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> Older people living on their own can be sad in the hands of almost anyone else, but Simon's intelligent intelligence and brilliant sense of personality transform this 1972 amendment into a comedy gone. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much friction your nose is in a semi-existential state without stopping you at all. Willie tells an old friend to write songs before deciding that the man probably died after writing a song that she sang "Lady" with "Baby". "89 years, and such does not die." <br /> <br /> Burns won the Academy Award for his humble performance as a gentle but corrupt Lewis, but Matau is the one who brings this house together, its elegance and pride but it is rude but it actually sells you the idea that it was already 73 when it did this. Willie is very angry, and deserves to be described as a "crazy old man" but you root him all the time, and enjoy his small victories even when they come at the expense of the patience of others. Your lines also kill you, especially when you try to kill Lewis, who found that reuniting the TV is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You're out of reach!" Tells Willie Lewis at some point. "I'm still in demand, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room is burning, it will not be hot," Lewis replied. Director / <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross photographs everything in a very informal way, with low light and mid-range shots even in emotional moments, to make room for comedy and the overall movie message from Zen through quiet acceptance. You never feel that you are watching a movie, which is one of the many "Sunshine Boys" charms, and Ross's direction, like the representation of the three directors, goes a long way towards that end. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when people who watch life go through it, but "The Sunshine Boys" make it seem fun, because for us watching it.
