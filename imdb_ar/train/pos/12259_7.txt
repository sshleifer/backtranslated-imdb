A "family relationship" brings us back to less complicated time in America. It makes sense to see how everything was different at the time. It was a more peaceful time in our country, and we are seeing a "functional" family dealing with things together. The film also depicts the beginning of a series that depicts the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> George Seitz's film is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emily face an internal crisis that must be dealt with. The married daughter Joan returns home after making a social mistake and being carried away by her husband. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home Aziz, who will obviously collide with her father. It seems that Andy the happy teenager is the only one without a problem so that his mother will accompany him to dance, which is reluctant to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best because he is putting a plan in place to get everyone back. After all, he is a man who understands not only law, but how he deals with external forces that threaten his position in society and what makes his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays the role of Judge Hardy with conviction. It is the glue that brings everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small role in this film, but it's always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as two daughters, Marion and Joanne. Sarah Hayden and Margaret Marquez appeared in "Aunt Millie" and "Polly", the girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> A "family relationship" is a good way to observe our past through a positive image drawn from an American family.
