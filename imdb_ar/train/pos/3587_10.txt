I really like this film ... When I started to watch it, I thought I would be bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I saw it many times now. The characters are believable and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time is Beverly Hills 90210). I would like to recommend this film if you are a fan of his film, but I agree with another previous comment that the end is disappointing. You've loved to turn a little different! It does not matter though, a good gripping story.
