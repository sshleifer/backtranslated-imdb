There are not many films that gave me a feeling like Stardust did throughout the film. Stardust, which resembles a magical fairy tale like The Prince Pride, is one of the most beautiful fantasy scenes of 2000 and the 1990s. Exciting, fun, and well-presented with memorable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know very well how it will end, but it's the journey, not the destination that draws the viewer from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not a dozen less.
