This was my favorite favorite Christmas and I wish it was released on VHS or DVD, where I lost 33 rpm, and any sweeping tapes I created are long gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a great John, but Denver was very impressed with the music, which was often the traditional favorite of the stream of toys (esp Little St. Nick!) and included some well known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Although done in the late 1970s, this offer had a lasting feeling. Hope to find a copy soon!
