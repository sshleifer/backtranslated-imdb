From NASCAR's obsessive-like point of view, the film is interesting. You can see many racing cars since 1983. Even watching them is difficult, the racing scenes are not very realistic. But I have to admit that I did not see any race before 1995, because before that, they did not show any NASCAR races in Germany). <br /> <br /> From the point of view of one of the fans of Bert Reynolds like me, the film is essentially what We used to see him from Reynolds in the eighties: Bert behind the wheel in a fast car, as in his films Pandit. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Bert Reynolds, this movie is a must see. If you only love one of these 2 things, I would also recommend watching it. If you do not like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, you still have to give him a chance, but remember that this film was far from winning an Oscar for Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's the hilarity of the 1980s. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you'll also be impressed.
