What can one say about Alvira that has not already been said in the international press? Classic comedy presented by IS Elvira in the first large comic masterpiece with a full budget. <br /> <br /> From the very first movie frame, Elvira packs an impressive package that clearly says Great .... The Heart Out, Davis House! See Elvira miserable, see Elvira exciting, see Elvira jealous, see Elvira fatal. You can do nothing but admire her talent for acting! <br /> <br /> In the heart of this comic masterpiece, Elvira's desire is to show the stars of Las Vegas. Despite putting the "boob again in the boobtube" as a horror hostess (with most), Elvira finds the small screen emotionally restricted .... and physically! Nouf said she packed her bag and headed the East ... a small dog in hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer identifying her "heritage" inheritance on the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times, I can read it almost literally .... (literally will only appear)! <br /> <br /> Get a copy, laugh at yourself silly, and learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why did not you win the Best Actress Oscar for this role beyond me.
