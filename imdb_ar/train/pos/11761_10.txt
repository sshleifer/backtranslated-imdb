Kurt Russell is at his best as a man living from his past glory, Renaud Hittauer. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare major performance such as Jack Dundee. I dropped the big pass in more than one way. <br /> <br /> You'll see some of the most crossover scenes ever seen in a single film, where Jack hides on the mice and poses a Renault and a caribou out call. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic game that is not afraid to show football in the mud the way you should play it (note the NFL).
