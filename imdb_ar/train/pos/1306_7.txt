An actor with an unusual straight face played by actors and portrayed by the director taking the material seriously. As expected, the film was clearly filmed on a tight budget, but the drama involved it - it's one of those movies that when Gathiana repeats an ad on Cinemax 2 or More Max or what they call, ending up seeing blocks 40 minutes when you It should work. Along with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget budget colleagues, who have a real ability to speed up a genre of film, when he cares The actors (for example, do not care to watch any of his Shannon Tweed clicks with 3 or 4 after the title!) The actors who have very little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, and even Gary Sandy for the Chrises) really put everything they had in some Of their best roles in years - as for Greco, he has the right shape, although his representation is one little note - of the It is clear that his character is supposed to destroy herself all the time the film, but Greco does not convey it completely. I have seen the IMDB and see that the writer also wrote "Women's Club in the Massacre 2" and "Island Dinosaurs" of the director - both of them are small classic in their rights, but it is clear that the film "Roger Cormon," which resembles the movie "like a movie" some of the best Jonathan Demi and Jonathan Kaplan B - Pictures from the seventies - gives you the element of exploitation but the presentation of drama at the same time - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane", the last comedic moments are somewhat turbulent, but they are well written, and are driven by a higher-than-average character. Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when the time comes, which is rare enough (as I was reminded while trying to sit through Albert Pune's brutality called "Heatseeker" the other night - these low budget items are not as easy as they seem - but these Another story!)
