After graduation from high school, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to make a trip to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian named Nick. After spending time with Nick, he asks them if they want a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him. They agreed. At the airport, they are caught for drug trafficking and then convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they did not do. They do not really know what to do. They have finished contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Word has it that if you have money can help you. Things start well, but they still can not get out. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good because it does not allow what will happen and it is interesting all the time. I could not believe the end though. It was one of those endings where you do not know the truth 100%, but you still know something that actually happened with Nick and drug trafficking because of "owning" and so on. <br /> <br /> Claire offers both Danes and Kate Beckinsel very good shows here. The Beckinsales performance was a bit weak. Both the friendship between the Danes and the Vikings are good but they can look stronger. Paul Walker has a small role not supported here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it 7/10.
