I do not think most people give this film as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror films and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes scarecrow is afraid fighting kung fu, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really did not have this fun movie watching since Candyman. So the town picks up this child, who is called Scarecrow, so that his mother does not care about him. Then kills and instills the soul in the scapegoat, which then continues to kill. It is relatively easy to assume its demise once the movie starts. In the end, dedication goes directly to a group of horror directors, but with the dedication of most of them to Dario Argento, I was really struck by fantastic characters, those people who wanted to make films of a new kind. On the film contains a lot of Arnold Rogue, with a hardcore one will definitely laugh like a stick around and kill Sharif with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza some friends laugh your $ off with this movie. I love it for its authenticity, more fun.
