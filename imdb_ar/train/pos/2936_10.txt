If only Eddie Murphy was born after 10 years. Then we all remembered it. But until I was only 4 when I came out. If you have not seen it yet, Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash and all the family comedy movies from Eddie - and then watch this. Hands, you will laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> You should really see them more than once to understand all the jokes. From loud humor to children's humor! (If you see that you'll laugh here) - you'll love his objects. If you (or an adult fan) try to download clips from Eddie's actions. All the shows vary as you imagine and have more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But this is like the "best" for Eddie Murphy, which is labeled "X" if you will. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that please do not watch a Delirious movie if you do not like comedy, or you do not have a sense of humor or do not like fun. You will only put this wonderful classic of Eddie Murphy and maybe make someone miss her. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got the Beverly Hills Cop and is famous for it - Delirious.
