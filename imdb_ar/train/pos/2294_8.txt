... Sky hook for French film lovers and an extension of French screen actors / actresses. At worst, leniency, actors fooled around other actors, questioning the validity of acting as a profession at all, etc. at best is a glorious celebration / dispatch of some of the best actors currently working. From a simple premise - Jean Pierre Mariel asked for water to be ignored in a restaurant - Piler is in all directions and allows the cream of French cinema to poke its objects before the camera gestures to those who no longer exist (Jean Gabin), Lino Ventura (including the director's father) , Bernard, one of the biggest opponents of French cinema, making a celestial phone call at the end of the film. My speech and proleuks, yes, guilty as charged but also something of guilty pleasure.
