I know I know it was a good ending but honestly it was wonderful. I love when a film ends up in a wonderful dark color, but this time I was impressed with the Vedar Vedder against the emperor who was really amazed. The sequence of pain in this film was when Luke was tortured and defeated by Emperor / Darth Sidius. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the dark Sith Lord, removes his Dark Master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the warships ships of the rebels' battle and all the warships of the empire and superstar destroyers. I liked the new race they brought on the screen Mon Calomari, eewoks, sulesteian (Lando co-pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite viewers in this movie: 1 - When the Emperor Vader is destroyed and wounded fatal. 2 - When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3 - When you kill LEIA Jabba choke the master of Hutt's crime. <br /> <br /> Personally I like the script and the Indore Battle, which offers a land and space battle as well as the best Star Wars game between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. After the script: the viewer with Lea in the slave bikini do not forget. 10/09.
