This is the best Chinese film I've ever seen, and in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several types: a beautiful love story, action film, comedy and horror at the same time. The most surprising thing is that he really succeeded in all this! <br /> <br /> This movie certainly makes it one of the best 5 movies, and it should be fun for every movie lover. The sequence of motion contains the unrealistic and unrealistic jump, but the way it is taken is very different from the Hero style and the plane always looks fantastic and is usually logical (the ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, we will not regret it . 10/10
