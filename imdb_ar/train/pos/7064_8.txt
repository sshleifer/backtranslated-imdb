Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and enabled her to remain a great equator. By the mid-1930s, most of the great directors who were in Universal like Milestone, Browning, and Wyler had gone. James Will remained only but the prestigious horror films were behind him. Dina and Judy Garland appeared in a short film "Every Sunday." Garland was initially proposed for Penny's role in Three Smart Girls. When Garland was not available Universal turned to Durbin. At first she was definitely a supportive player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her an actress. Directed by Henry Coaster, the film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful panorama of the lake in Switzerland. The three smart girls in the title - three sisters, Joanne (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Reid) and Benny (Diana Dorpin) sail with Benny to make her glorious voice to "My Heart Sing". Not all was well on the home front - their father plans to marry a young woman (Benny Barnes) until the three girls help their poisoned nurses (Lucille Watson) go to New York and not reunite with their mother. . Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Ruth Taylor's cruel mother at the Waterloo Bridge (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger, with her smiling mother (Alice Brady), designed to marry Judson Craig (Charles Wenninger). For someone who does not have a film experience, Deanna is as great as Penny, her typical annoying sister who outgrows her enthusiastic child and is as pretty as the picture. When she sings "Someone Takes Care of Me" for her father, she will only melt - what a wonderful voice. It also has one of the most extreme lines in the film. When her father calls her "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow," she replies, "Oh, I can see enough monkeys here!" <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decided to rent a "number" (Misha Oyer) for Donna's friendship. They arrange to meet in a nightclub but because of a mixed mix, Lord Michael Stewart (Ray Milland) is wrong because of the count and Donna (she thinks she owns half of Australia !!!). Kay and Donna want to speed up her marriage to Judson. <br /> <br /> Benny decided to put things in her hands and escape. She was escorted to the local police station where the police were thrilled to hand her "Il Bacio" (trying to convince them that she was a young opera singer). Happily ending with their mother navigating with their father, Oyer) and sail with him to Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
