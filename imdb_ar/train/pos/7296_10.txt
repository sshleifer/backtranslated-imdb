There is absolutely no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact is that both are a series of police on violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Creator plots are very simple. The Fortier plot is more complex ... Fortier looks like the chief suspect, if we have to discover similarities ... The main character is weak and strange, but we have a "clairvoyance". People like comparison, judgment and evaluation. What about just enjoying? The funny thing is that the people who write Fortier look like Americans, but on the other hand, they argue that they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it is language or soul, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The representation is not superficial at all ...
