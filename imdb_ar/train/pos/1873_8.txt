The 25-year-old violinist, Anton Fischer (Derek Locke), is sent to three assessment sessions with Navy psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) after another spate of aggression against the top-ranked Navy man. He hesitates at the beginning of the treatment. He trusts Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, and reveals painful trauma that arose in his adoptive home. Meanwhile, Cheryl Smolley (Joey Bryant) meets and they fall in love with each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This real family drama is a moving and positive story for a man who finds a friend and is brought back to normal life. Denzel Washington is excellent, it makes him sensitive, attractive and has a good taste, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, this may be a very heavy story. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando a Viver"
