Most people, especially young people, may not understand this film. It sounds like a loss story, when in fact it's a story about being lonely. Some people may never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> The character of Charles Johnson reflected the complete personality of Sandler Fineman. When Johnson felt besieged by his blessings, Veneman was trying to forget his life from the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful addition to the actors and Sandler draws tears. Cheadle had a playful role and was a great supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. A very good movie If you are lost and felt alone, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
