Probably one of the most extreme movies in the world. Articles Oscar. Tracy Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this I suggest you see "South Park" one of the most exciting animations created. Buy it, you will laugh every time you see it. Pure stroke of genius. If you do not think it is funny you will not have a spirit or a sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
