I'm surprised that movies like this are still possible to make. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen. Never thought that a 146-minute film could make me think of it. <br /> <br /> Washington, an attractive and intense figure as it always has, plays a cynical role, a former counterterrorism agent who has been washed. The bottle. Once assigned to the protection of small Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and compensatory bow begins in the way that only a lovely little girl can provide. Inevitably, a house is hijacked by thugs, and Crissy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price of audacity to take the character bear catalyst. Yes, he has become ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie.
