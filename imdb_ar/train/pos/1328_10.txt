Without an "anachronism," this film I would like to find on DVD is an exceptional dive into the vital and mental context of people's thinking before "world's disappointment." So, there is thirty years, the director and screenwriter can test such sympathy, this romantic truth to do so wonderful masterpiece. It will be necessary to be able to see and re-examine the film in order to capture better than the time and cultural distance that we lose from the ability to integrate / understand and analyze and finally accept such or such "primitive thinking." Impossible to sense it in a secular world yet contains certain keys to our behavior, that future generations are only going to be able to analyze with sufficient importance.If someone knows where I can get a digital copy or VHS to me or DVD? Thank you in advance.
