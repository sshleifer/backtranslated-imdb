Let us adjust one thing: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr Strangelov Young Frankenstein. It's a silly flick, with three wonderful threads (you can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht, Amy Boehler of SNL and Queen Parker Parker, as charming as ever. The basic story: The three girls were "losers" in college, and still follow. Boyler is a dog trainer (he can not even get an appointment with a blind man), and Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office" ... I noticed that after several minutes ... I'm a bit slow Thing, well!), And he has a homely teacher (Seth Myers of SNL, funny). They have to prevent the "cool" senator's daughter (Amber Tamblin, always kind of the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") from embarrassing her during the spring break. Of course, they have to watch it, and there is some fun. All in all, light, simple comedy, very short, and very fun
