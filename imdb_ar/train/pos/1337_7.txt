......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this film is less clear (or even not) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new theme for Bollywood. The subject was accepted but is far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, the subject is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has a number of cliches. The film is presented in a very "film" way. There are some very little plot holes. The movie is picked up once Rani is shot down to make you see something other than the usual movie. Otherwise the whole family chain felt exaggerated at first. Acting can not be better. Salman Khan is sometimes admired, and sometimes disappoints you. Here one of the best offers. Moreover, its role is well written, so that it revives you every time a problem arises. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, she feels her most personal character, but is overwhelmed by Preity Zinta. Britta Zinta is a perfect image. Of the three, everyone is given a chance to get their money. It is amazing how compelling it can be when you are innocent. Trust me, Madbala is far from your girl. This role is one reason why its rate is high. The support team looks like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no interest in the plot but I find it acceptable here. The songs are very beautiful. The title song is my favorite all the time with Del Terra Mira del (Hearts). The site of Quran and Muhndi and Alon Ne (look at the world scene) are songs that fit the film perfectly. It was not possible to shorten the number of the Premi club, Diwani Diwani (crazy), while Punjabi No. 1 was boring although he was dancing well. Otherwise the film is definitely worth watching.
