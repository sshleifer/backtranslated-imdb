The big surprise in this film was Daryl Hannah's performance. Instead of playing the stereotypical blonde role models that you usually play, they play an intelligent role in the smart and tedious streets. She does not have a big role, but she does a wonderful job portraying Louis Harlan as a woman tired of covering up her boss, although she is used to it.
