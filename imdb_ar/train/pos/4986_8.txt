Lensman is an less famous anime gem than the Toho and MK studios. It is loosely built on the novel, but it reminds me more of a "Metroid" game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, check in Japanese with translations or only in Japanese. The dubbed version was copied in almost English and edited to death. <br /> <br /> There are not a lot of new features, although it's the first animated feature that combines CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch, however.
