Actually Sonic is 7.5. Anyway, the film was good, it has funny parts that make it worth watching, not misunderstand me, it's not the funniest movie in the world, it's not original because it's an idea we've seen before. A friend of mine told me other films, but this movie has a taste Special, tell me that this movie was for their friends ... I think this is not exactly who cares? There is another film that shows us the same theme, in which Chris Rock, the name Down to Earth, shows men, one of them a very funny film, see if you want and I know you will agree that Mr. Rock won the movie. I liked to be given the character of the protagonist for Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
