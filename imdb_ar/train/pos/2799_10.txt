As an anti-football player, I reluctantly took my younger brother to watch this film, although I hoped the East would be the second East. The trailers looked so interesting that I thought I would give them a chance. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but then it was glued to the screen, and it was not about neck cramps. Because of sitting near the front because of the crowded hall. The acting was fresh and vibrant, attractive characters, and really funny jokes. The whole room was laughing loudly every minute or so. A football fan or no football fan, sport has become irrelevant to the fundamental principles of love, friendship, family, independence and competition. Add a dash to Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, I dare say ... better than the East East. <br /> <br /> This film tells along with a beautiful rhythm, never going into anything too long and leaving nothing unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally involved. Although it is not a feature film, there are some good surprises on the way and things do not always happen as you expect. <br /> <br /> He said there were elements of predictability, but they were more cynical than using them as a filler. I suppose depending on your own tendency to happy endings, you may be delighted or let down in the end. Personally, if there is any other result I would have written a strongly worded letter to the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> For the actors, I would like to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paola) put in the best performance. I never knew such people existed, but their reality with strange concepts sometimes persuaded me that they might do! The Uncensored Best Personality Award, unfortunately, goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, so they did a great job, it's just that someone else is the best and sorry Kira, this time you. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not leave before balances. As soon as the lights came back I realized in my horror that perhaps I should not have seen this film after all. My beloved "Ice Junkie" was forgotten but melted was melted in sugary blue juice. Oh, what I'm saying, it was quite glamorous and I can not recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when I take it out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I'm a student. I'm just outside if it's really worth it.
