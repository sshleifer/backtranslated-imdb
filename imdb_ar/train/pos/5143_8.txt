With the quick intersection of scenes of insane people in asylum, montage / overlapping images, and mysterious and tangled stories, this is a very difficult film to follow. A man (Masui Inou) appears to be a concierge or asylum seeker to be near his imprisoned wife, possibly to save her. But she is clearly crazy, gathered on the ground, with the expression vacancy most of the time and fear, misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. Sometimes the director moves to her point of view, and we see mysterious pictures of her on the side of a pool that sinks a child, or clings to a child who is drowning. She is tormented by something. When the point of view goes to her or to other crazy people, the director uses distorted lenses and such things, shows us what crazy people see, and then how they react. The place is surrounded by crazy people, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing day and night. At some point, the man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the door frightens her and returns to her cell. Gradually the man slips into a nightmare, interrupting it in another attempt to steal it away, killing the doctor and many of the attendees, and every time the crazy people laugh and clap. When he wakes up, he feels relieved and blurs the ground. Some of Japan's brilliant shots of life, streets and buildings in the 1920s.
