(You'll know what I mean after you see Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> In general, Red Eye was more exciting than expected. It starts at a slow start, and builds slowly. But by the time it's over, it's a bummer! <br /> <br /> It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes this thriller ... exciting as I found it. Otherwise, simply, the manager has done a reliable job from your garage to doing what could have been a conspiracy in the end. I used to forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> I think other factors are the "proximity" of the victim and the bad guy ... and over time, you begin to really associate with the victim. Scant 8 out of 10, more like 7.5 ... but that's very good!
