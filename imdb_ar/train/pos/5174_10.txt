I swear I can watch this movie at the end of every week of my life and not get sick of it! Each aspect of human emotions is captured magically through the representation, script, direction, and general feeling of the film. It's been a long time since I saw a film that made me choke on laughter, reflected in sadness, and I feel that every sense of intent comes in this most excellent work! We need more movies like this! Mike Binder: Do you listen ???
