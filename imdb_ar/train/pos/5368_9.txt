This is a great action movie with big linings of Arne! It is stylishly made, with a lot of tense procedures to keep one satisfied. The characters were wonderful, and Richard Dawson, very threatened as the main villain. Yes, there are lots of holes in the plot, yet they are very entertaining, with a wonderful ending as well. She had a wonderful story as well, and Arne and Maria Kunshita Alonso had a great chemistry together. Personal development was also good with some great performances. The steering is awesome! Paul Michael Glaser, does a very good job here, with great use of colors, keeping it stylish all the time, brilliant camera angles, and generally keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. There is little gorre. We get a few gunshot wounds, a head explodes, a slit in the throat, blood slices of blood, corpses without skin, blood, and scary. Great acting! Arnold Schwarzenegger is as amazing as ever, he's excellent in the acting section, he has a lot of funniest hooks, kicking in that ass, and as always with a great physical presence! (Rules show me!). Maria Conchita was a good Alonso, here, she was really nice, and she had a good chemistry with Arne! Yaphet Kotto, decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin McIntyre was good for the nice guy, it was great! Richard Dawson is wonderful as a main villain, and he was very threatening and was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Eirland van Liddeth, Gus Richthwich and Professor Toro Tanaka all have to do very well like stalkers. Overall you should see! **** 1/2 of 5
