[No Vandals] <br /> <br /> Being a David Lynch film, one can have an idea that he portrays this mysterious mind as his majority of feature films do. But it is a very straight story where the title may hint. Do not except fall into the usual Lynchian vacuum of misunderstanding that usually occurs after displaying any missing highway. It's a simple film but it's actually a great movie. This is both an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe this is Lynch. He likes to wrap our minds and then collect a film that may sound very far from Lynch himself. Because he is a very sophisticated director, he may make such a film only to harass his usual audience because he knows what they expect but does not offer them. That would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> Movie speed is slow. I would almost say the speed of the lawn mower ... do not expect to be an exciting orgy, but the movie is really amusing for those who go with the movie flow. Look carefully for those small details Lynch paints during the film for our entertainment. Look for the wonderful cinema that makes this movie come to life. He heard the Badalamenti result and the main theme that revives naturally the sights of Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth presents one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most beloved men to appear in the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. It only glows through its gusts and acts as an Oscar nomination. I need to say that his poor health in this film did not act? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot after the film was completed. This knowledge focuses on the film because it becomes more appreciated for Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> The above is a very nice animated image suitable for all kinds of people who love the movie in the way they are supposed to be. One can ask about the statues that are not clear and somewhat naive but do not destroy the general picture, because it is an unforgettable picture. 10/09.
