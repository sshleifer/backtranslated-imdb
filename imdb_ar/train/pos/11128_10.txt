First I would say how great this is. It is shocking and sometimes shocking. At the very least, I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie. I can definitely make a boring film, but that's not boring. It is like a journey across humanity. Their stark realism appears through this huge masterpiece. It is a sad tale of the heart between two competitors (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), the naive Texas nail comes to New York to make it rich through entertainment for women. Soon after Rico Rizo Rizzo (Hoffman) meets, a poor man who can barely pay the rent. Ratsu became a "manager" for Joe, but soon the two men did not find Joe's job, stealing food. While trying to stay on the streets of New York, realize how difficult it is. They can not get a girl's atmosphere until they meet a lady at a party. Joe earns some money and soon takes Joe Ratsu's dream spot in Ratsu, Florida. The last five minutes crash some of the greatest moments of the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes annoying urban landscape of life.
