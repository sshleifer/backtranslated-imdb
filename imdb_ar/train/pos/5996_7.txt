I have repeatedly stated that if people do not want to make copies or duplicates, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the independent film world. Having said that, the last time I saw an independent film should be six months ago easily. So here's an Indonesian review that caught my attention on Youtube; The Cure. <br /> <br /> Instantly, you can say that the film follows the style of the avant-garde film that Telegraph uses to get close, scoops and quick editing. He is proud of the way he looks - and he has the right to be. For the most part, it is a very fine little piece, with the exception of an unforgivable disregard for the 180-degree rule and the effect of a bad comic shoot, a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self-financed projects. <br /> <br /> However, despite these amateur mistakes, the majority of shots are actually a pleasure to look at. We provide you with good use of props and locations, good visual representation and some fluid editing in the air, which have become commendable because this is definitely something you will not see much at all by sending Youtube. Although the basic hypothesis is fairly simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we see here is telling the story at work; you can not really predict a straight three-act structure and if you do not, you may not be ready For this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> Since the movie unfortunately disappoints the sound. What you will hear all the time is a distorted sound that often seems unfaithful, and worse still is the continuous background music, which is undergoing a simple change and does not add much to anything. Much attention is paid to visual images that seem to be negligently neglected and neglected, and this becomes very apparent when you realize that you have just missed four sentences of narration and have to retreat to catch what is beyond your attention. <br /> <br /> So let them watch, but do so with the sound turned off. <br /> <br /> Another idea; was anyone else reminded of the cover of Doug Neylor's dwarf red novel "Last Man" early in the film? If you have a book you know what I mean.
