Certainly, Page 3 is an attractive and extremely attractive opener that reveals intelligently the life style of a Mumbai elite. From fake kisses to plaster smiles, leaves no stone untouched to reveal the appalling life of the rich and famous. The challenge is background, gossip, corruption and scandal in every dark corner of the world of glamor and magic. Humanism and generosity are like an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly eager to get more money, more fame, and higher reputation, which leads them to do the most shameful things imaginable from signing funeral films to child molestation. Everything is possible in this city where there is a wide gap between social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both categories through the protagonist's eyes. I have noticed the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling agitation of social workers. Both Bollywood, business people, politicians and the underworld are all tangled up in a completely twisted mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful path such as Kuan Min Duop Jaongi. Fantastic movie with an excellent personal twist!
