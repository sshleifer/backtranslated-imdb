I found this comic comedy deeply amusing. Brosnan is a genius. As anyone will see now, it should not be a pigeon in the role of association. Kenner was an attractive and funny character like anyone who could be in this role. I do not know if you've laughed hard during any movie! Yala of unexpected fun! My favorite line would be "I feel like I'm a prostitute in Bangkok on Sunday after leaving the Navy for the town." Brosnan delivered this very close line with this unexpected comedy skill. I was very impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film forked out of their previous work to a degree that led to better comedy. If you like the dark and delightful "weather man", you will certainly be impressed. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
