I know that there are some fundamentalists who resort to anything that is not exactly like the original, but sometimes the occasional results can be based on their own merits. I love the new iron chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time serves the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things in a tone. The iron chefs themselves are very interesting. I know that the original versions may have been the best chefs in the world at the time, but Bobby Fly is the only American Ironman to beat them. Mario Batali seems to be the most fun when cooking, making comments, and shining during construction. I watched the series and found that all the players worked together well. Judges are not always the best choices, however. There are some exceptions, such as turning a lawyer into a food enthusiast, but most judges are doubtful that they can handle what is being offered. I enjoy watching the chefs and the surprise. The food at the end looks great and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe this is all anyone can ask, really want to eat what is served. The only thing I really want to change in this series is to ask people in the fair to relax a bit. Sometimes the mood becomes a bit tense, and it's not always fun to watch when you expect more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was too much like the original, but I can say that it was a very expensive proposition. I wish I had stayed with this version and had a host - between Bill Schattner and Alton Brown, and this would make me smile for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can accept this series based on its advantages, you may find it a pleasant clock.
