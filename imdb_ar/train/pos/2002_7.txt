To some extent, I really liked this movie better than the original vampires. I found that the film is hateful to women. As a woman and a fan of terror, I am used to the fact that women at risk are the main component of this kind. But they just slapped Cheryl Lee around the road a lot. In this film, Natasha Wagner is a more fully aware person, and the bad guy is a girl! Arly Jover (who played the role of the blade board) is another very deadly world. John Bon Jovi ... Well, yes, not a great actor, but it's fine. At least do not start singing. Catch it on the cable if you can. It's appearing in action this month.
