I traveled from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see the premiere of this movie - and really happy because I did. As an admirer of big-screen and Northern California lifelong, I was surprised by the number of Oscar-winning movies in the Gulf. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Gulf instead of going to Los Angeles, George Lucas' comments about perseverance and community and seeing resonance with me really. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can do it in SF, the other artists can. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
