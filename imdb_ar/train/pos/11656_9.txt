I have seen two films about eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders near the end automatically improve or accept the fact that they need help and that's it. This film I thought was the most realistic reason in this film, Lexi's main character does not automatically improve. It gets better then it has a drawback. I think this film shows more than the other films I saw that the improvement is not only happening, it is hard work and takes time, it is a long way to recover. I think this film shows all that well. There must be more movies like this.
