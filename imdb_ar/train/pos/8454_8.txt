The tale of the alternative universe Gundam (G-Gundam is the first), Gundam Wing is another different viewpoint in Aya Gundam. The familiar items were found, but Gundam's suite is quite different from its peers. The greatest of Gundamas is nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In fact, the series does not become an account of the war until episode 7, but in reality, the real conflict, Eve wars, occurs only after the subsequent episodes. <br /> <br /> The greatest positives of this series are characters. All the main characters are embodied during episode 49 and you can empathize with each of the roles in which you put them. In addition to another wonderful feature is the wonderful character and mica design of this series. Some designs put their other Gundam counterparts to shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is the number of fans who are dying badly at UCLA's rift from the original epic of the University of California. Why does Gundam Wing get this rap when the most obvious UC clone of Gundam Seed is out of me. It is true that many moments have been raised but they have been told in new ways and there are also obvious differences. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the usual comparison between Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. During the series, Zechs is more visible in the alliance and in the OZ as well, while Red Comet was a shining star. The other big difference is the fact that Zaks is losing a lot of soldiers under his command and hence the other title he gave in the early episodes: "Assassin of his men." Char is not given this rating. <br /> <br /> The problems in this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy but rather problems. The first is the reusable animation footage of the Gundams attacks. It is certainly fun to see heavy assault tanks, MS, and aircraft the first time. But in its fourth look, you reuse such scenes. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the entire string is supposed to be done in a full year. If you really think about all the events that appear in this series, much will happen in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily ignore this fact when you ignore the first lines of the intro often. Given their classification, this may be the best Gundam tales of the alternative universe and a wonderful introduction to Gundam's world. After all, this was the first Gundam film in the air on American television.
