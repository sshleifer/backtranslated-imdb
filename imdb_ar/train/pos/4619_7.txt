First, I'm a big fan of the 1980s, as well as Jennifer Connelly. Until yesterday, I wandered through a local bookstore / film store and found the VHS version. I read the back and looked well and the $ 3.99 amount was good. I took him home and showed up on a VCR. What a sweet movie! In my age now, I am more in contact with movies such as About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember how the situation was at the age of 15/16 and in love with an older man, and so on. We all have those little batons when we're younger. If that does not work, we are sad and we think we will not overcome it. But of course we do. Many times. It is a kind of sweet quality that I really got from this film. The feeling of "Oh, I remember when something like this happened to me ...". The characters are interesting and sophisticated. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies in the 80s or teen movies in particular or anyone who wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
