When I think of Gidi's return I think epic. Yes Ewoks were there what in it? It is an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that it resembles the Vietcong who also managed to overthrow a technologically advanced army by primitive acts). Gedi is definitely darker then the rest of the movies. The emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing playwright Ian MacDarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is very evil and evil, and Vader seems like Mr. Rogers compared to him. He talks about Darth Vader, who has an amazing end to this character. Vader is really a modern Greek tragedy, and I think people can now understand this and appreciate it especially after the Revenge of the Sith. His faith in the end was moving and bringing a sense of resolve and passivity to you. The best part of course was the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early 1980s can stand the test of time with graphics. The scenes at Japa Palace (Lea looks stunning in that metal bikini) and of course the epic triangular battle in the end is still amazing to look at. In all the deep Jedi plots and emotional moments (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and stunning special effects is an appropriate end to one of the most beloved privileges in the history of cinema.
