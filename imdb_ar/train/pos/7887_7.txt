If you're a fan of Freddy, you may not like it. This seems to be a parody of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason he keeps himself is the background story of Freddie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always great in Nightmare movies is death scenes. But the scenes of death were very crazy in this. The visual effects were fantastic and the acting was good but the background story was excellent. Essentially, Freddy's story comes in full circle in this. <br /> <br /> I have read bad reviews for this but I really enjoyed it despite the many flaws: 1. Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Dead Freddie: The Ultimate Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Nightmare On Elm Street 5: A Child's Dream. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy this series. This is what Freddy has made clear, but that's all. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
