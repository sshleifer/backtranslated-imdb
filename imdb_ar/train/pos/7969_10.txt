Homewood Bond is a beautiful film. You knew the part where the shadow falls in the trench ... I cried, and since I was six years old, I cried! It takes a lot of tears to me! Dogs and cats are well trained. A beautiful family movie, * not * for non-slave people or those who hate animals perfectly, but can be satisfied with people like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie in general, 10/10!
