The film is truly moving and unique. The story is universal in being a battle between good and evil and the world. The most important thing is that their classification is wrong, misleading, and farce. Blockbuster categorized it as if it were an X-rated film. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and must be seen by children who can read simple and minor subtitles.
