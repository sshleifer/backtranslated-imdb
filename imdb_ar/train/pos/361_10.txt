As I said at the top, only four stars are not enough. It is one of the best films I have seen in my life in almost 17 years. For people who do not really like it or do not understand it, you should not have a real appreciation of art or you may have short attention. <br /> <br /> Even if I have not seen all his films yet, I would say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It's very sad to see that great films such as "The Color Purple" do not come very much because I think we are all in desperate need of first class entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <Movies like this are more than just films; they are pieces of art that need more appreciation. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​being nominated for the Oscar 11 (even the best picture of the year) and did not get one cup is a sign of how Hollywood blind and stupid can sometimes be. Spielberg is not nominated for the best director! It was supposed to sweep the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows you how unfair the lives of some people are. <br /> <br /> If only the films are still good ...
