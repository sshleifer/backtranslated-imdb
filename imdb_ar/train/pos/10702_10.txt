Among what critics and the public pointed out, the GIRL BIRTHDAY was to be a big fat clinker. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. Proved to be worth watching. Sure, it's not a basic American comedy, and it does not take a genius to realize it's a very British film, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies in the place, where he breathed fresh air. Sure, there were some holes in the plot, but overall they worked. First, Kidman was fantastic again in a very different role, not too glamorous, but he is still very exciting. She continues to prove that she is one of the best talent in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent effective when speaking English, but there are times when you have long conversations in Russian, and if you do not know she was Nicole Kidman, you will never doubt her originality. Harrison Ford had to take note of the "K-19". Overall a slight small film works despite the terrible buzz.
