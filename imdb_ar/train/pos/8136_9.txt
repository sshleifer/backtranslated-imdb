This film is highly documented. It follows the rap group, NWH, from Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, in its unique way to reach the highest levels of gangs, landing and returning to the highest levels. Through a problem with women, such as vanity, police and white, this group reaches the top of gang rap world, where this movie moves to the top of the documents. I know that everyone who is stable is a Spinal Tap document, for a very good reason, yet I think that if in the right mood, this movie is better. Never laughs, even for someone who does not belong to rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white man who has no interest in rap or culture or anything else associated with it, but I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote and starred in the script and songs, showed great potential and it is a shame that I have not seen him since the fear of the black hat. However, I have seen him back more than you have, and I recommend you to "fear of a black hat" for you from a quick laugh. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot you to see the eggs! ... from their eyes? Do not shoot you to see the eggs." <br /> <br /> FYM Enjoy the movie.
