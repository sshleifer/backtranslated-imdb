You can call it a mystery, or maybe a small movie or a smart movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you to the life of someone who has lost his life and looks forward to recovering it. <br /> <br /> I must say I was really surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. This is not the kind I usually care about, but the characters quickly became for me and I wanted to know what was going on around him and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Just like many French movies on English provided, we are able to learn more about the personality and impact of their surroundings on their person. This film is character-driven and I will not disappoint!
