I read some reviews of this TV movie which all said that the film went on for a long time and it was just a thrilling entertainment. I agree that the film may last a very long time (it was 2:30 am enough ...) but I certainly do not think it raises the subject. Jim Jones' prolonged journey of power and its slow deterioration into mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse are never dealt with. The film takes time to show how the followers who recruited Jones (Brenda Vaccaro and Brad Doriff) are prominent in this regard, but also to note a strange shift in Jones' perception of reality. It is puzzling to see an equal and warm preacher turn into a devastating and cruel dictator. The film may not explore Jones's motives enough, making the whole ordeal a little superficial at times (it may also have to do with censorship). But the charming Powers Booth performance makes it all the more true. I'm not familiar with the real life of Jim Jones, but Booth certainly makes the monster he plays real and a friend. The film features a number of powerful scenes, including Jones 'tough words, Jones' meeting with the divine father (James Earl Jones), congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Betty) to Camp Guyana and, of course, the suicide scene. It is very interesting to see him and Booth is a captain in those last moments. Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the sudden skeptics, as is Veronica Cartwright (wife Jones) and Brad Doriff, especially when it comes time to drink the lethal dose. The relative calm of the end of this scene, the delicious direction and contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings, all make these images utterly impossible for her mind. A disturbing reflection on human nature and vulnerability. Worth seeing, even if that was in mind one of the truly horrific events of the twentieth century. Do not let it be repeated again. Paradoxically, such as the inscription at Camp Jones: "Those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it."
