This movie is very cool! The acting is fine, with an excellent choice for Burpen's Corbin as an ideal dentist who comes out and tortures his patients. At first, he sees his wife with the pool man, and then gets mad. He also avenged his wife and swimmer, along with the patients who tortured him. Most special effects are also considered beautiful, although some are really fake (such as a carved tongue, put one night outside, and still red in the morning). But the scenes of torture were done very well. Although this film has a weak point it is very slow; between heavy parts sometimes just very boring parts. But for real horror / excitement, this game has to be seen!
