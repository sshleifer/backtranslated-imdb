The Waiting Womans Ward In a large hospital with all its joys and sorrows, this is where LIFE BEGINS begins. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a wonderful little opera of soap filled with comedy and tragedy all linked to the lives of maternity workers and their patients. The openness in which the subject is processed indicates the state of the movie's preset code. <br /> <br /> Marvelous Aline MacMahon, as a sympathetic head nurse, is considered a quiet center of the film, a rock surrounded by all streams of flow. She is able to deal with any crisis or emergency, she is the best friend of the mother, and sometimes another friend. MacMahon is surrounded by a large group of wealthy people: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer who has been released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her frightening young husband; Copper Glenda Farrell as a child abuser; Sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother at her sixth birth; Preston Foster and Hel Hamilton as well-trained doctors And Frank McHugh as one of the delusional parents. <br /> <br /> The movie Maven will recognize Bob Watson as the first tic to see Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous couple and promise to act like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Rowland as a frightened Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as the wife of a phony doctor interested in adopting the son of Farrell - Are not supported. <br /> <br /> There is some absurdity in the plot - it is clear that some mothers are old. Farrell has become starkly drunk in the wing, but none of the staff seems to have been noticed; it is clear that a psychotic patient is able to wander at will - but this only reinforces the alien entertainment value of the film and prevents things from becoming too dangerous.
