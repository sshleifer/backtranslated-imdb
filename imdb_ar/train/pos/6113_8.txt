After seeing "Mafia marriage", I almost lost faith in Korean filmmaking. But this reinstated my faith. <br /> <br /> The female student at the university has forced the education of the spoiled, rich but attractive student man. Is actually the age of female personality. Through some fun quarrels, they ended up being dear friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that newcomer Kuan Sang Woo did his work with distinction. I've had such a revelation !! Kim Ha Noel was as charming as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedy. No unnecessary sexual scenes were shown. It was wonderful, beautiful, new, made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
