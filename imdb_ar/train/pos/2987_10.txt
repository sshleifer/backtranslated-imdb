This is the cry that the beaches were not. As far as I wanted to love the beaches, I always seemed hasty in its "sense" (soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower pace (sometimes too slow) and although she plays a bit in her tear story about the self-sacrificing mother, she works because Beth and the rest of the actors turn into great shows. 10/10
