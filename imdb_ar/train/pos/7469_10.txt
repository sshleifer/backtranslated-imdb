This film was absolutely wonderful. It actually made me think. During the whole movie I was at a loss like hell. I loved everything about it ... it was very confusing and awkward and strange, it was hard not to like it. All the actors were ostensibly, and no one could do better ... this is one of my favorites in the year ... it's worth the eye
