I do not think this film is for everyone. But I saw him this weekend in Seattle, and I thought it was very funny. This did not laugh hard during a long film. I thought the entire staff did a great job. You'll find yourself laughing from the first moment until the last scene. I suspect that some filmgoers (especially those who take themselves seriously WAY) will be stopped by this kind of humor. not me. The film was a real surprise. The entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the show I went to, which makes me think that many people have enjoyed and are happy to have fun in films for change. I can not wait to see it again! If you are in the mood for LOL it is suitable for you. Funny funny funny funny!
