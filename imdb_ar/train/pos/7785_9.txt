I've only seen two films about Bang Brothers, The Eye and One Just Taking. When I saw Al Ain, I was disappointed with those two people I had heard good words before. This film (The Eye) contains a really bad scenario, especially the end (childish, vulgar and very identical in my opinion), but still good in photography and experimental imagery. So I decided to see one take only and was not foiled again. The story is still wonderful, amazing image, MTV editing, and great music. This time, the story has a lot of independent, logical and beautiful spirit. You'll see some small holes in the plot, but it does not cause any problem in a story. The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
