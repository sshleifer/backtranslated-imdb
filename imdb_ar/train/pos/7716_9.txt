There is a good reason is that Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew of a relief ship, things they dare not solve. <br /> <br /> As doctor Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition to come to this planet 20 years ago. Since then he has married another member of the mission and has the daughter of Anne Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet that was once home to an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> Records that were decrypted by Pidgeon indicate that Krell reached a catastrophic end of unknown origin. The mechanism they left behind still works. <br /> <br /> Maybe it works very well as the members of the relief party begin to die in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about a remake and this one film is not being reproduced because it is as new as it was in 1956. The conditions will change, and now we say the twisting speed instead of the extra drive, Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see men on a relief trip in a fishing vessel like a spaceship. May look more like a Starship Enterprise or a ship than the 2001 A Space Odyssey. It is interesting to take a look at the science fiction films of different generations and see how future concepts change. <br /> <br /> The story behind Forbidden Planet is an immortal story of human beings trying to play God. <br /> <br /> You can not write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel, compiled by Pidgeon with his knowledge of the Krell study, was a successful blow to the day. He got a new lease on life in the 1960s with the robot character of Lost In Space. Watching with Earl Holiman who plays the cook on the spaceship and his compliance with Earl's request for some very funny household spirits. <br /> <br /> Ruby and other special effects were nominated for the Oscar, but lost to the Ten Commandments and the Red Sea. Bad luck for Forbidden Planet in the face of the founder of Hollywood such as Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classics will recognize Forbidden Planet as a future reworking of The Tempest, and when you think about it, Shakespeare could have been the adventure in science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among actors is Warren Stevens, who sacrificed, Leslie Nielsen was able to know exactly what he was dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this opportunity when it is broadcast.
