The name of this film made me single-handed to see what was going on around it, so I recorded it in the early hours of the morning. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to go through in the early days and actually saw a dramatic scene when the mine falls on men. It is clear that this film wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans helped the French miners to not believe the inhabitants of French cities. All the actors were fantastic, with unusual sights in the mine with a horse and a young boy working in the mine. There is a retired old miner working on the mine's ventilation ladder when the elevator collapses. If you're a real movie fan, this is a movie you will not want to miss.
