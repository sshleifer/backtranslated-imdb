My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (retired from the US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg in front of the Japanese, also received the cross. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that my father was the technical advisor to this film and I hope it has an impact on the film in making it look like how it really was at the time, as I read in several comments written by the viewers of this movie that looked like real life. My father was a fanatic of facts and figures, and he always wanted to see things as they were, so I would believe he had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Currently living in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for more than 40 years (ironically Japanese), a few years ago he received one of the highest praise from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities in returning Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur was banned after World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was a Marine, but I know that once you are a naval soldier, you are always a marine. That is exactly what it is and I love and respect it so much. <br /> <br /> I would love to be able to watch this movie if anyone has a copy of it. I would like to give it to my father on the occasion of his ninety-fourth birthday this year!
