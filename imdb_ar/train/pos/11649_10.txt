What a spectacular movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you will not regret it, it's very fun! Rajnakanth holds the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing else, I still love it. A.R.Rehman's music takes time to grow on you, but after hearing it many times, you really start to like it.
