This is difficult to see - says the former reviewer. It is amazing given the terrible films that emerged immediately after World War II - especially the "liberation" of Dachau. Obviously, since the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows "transport" is alive, as if it were based on an actual news bulletin (the Nazis would love to record their atrocities). Knox as brilliant Nazism. He painted the course of the Nazi profession. This chart is especially important when it contrasts with the reactions of other Germans, initially laughing at Hitler, then incredible, and ultimately no trick to him. But this contrast allows us to believe in "turning" a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi position. This happened, as witnessed by many attempts against Hitler, most notably the Stavenberg conspiracy that occurred during the appearance of this film. A powerful film, effectively used memories of the past, accurately predicts the paths of Nuremburg and other events that will occur once the war ends.
