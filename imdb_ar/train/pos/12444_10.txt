Best Blaise humility movie that I have seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a TV series. So I think it is a little "cult", as with a light touch of the charm of Quentin Tarantino, or something. They had a great deal of Modesty, but I conceded the loss of Willie Garwin a little. Even if I had read many comic books and books by Peter O'Donnell, I am not disappointed by this film, quite the opposite. Surprised positive of this story about modesty and childhood. I did not expect much anticipation, because of the bad film that happened in 1966. So I might have overestimated this film a bit. But if you like storyboards and other stories about Modesty Blaise, it's sure you'll see this story! Can not wait to continue ...
