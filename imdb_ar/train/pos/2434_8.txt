I have often wondered about CASPER's purpose for children ... with all the issues surrounding his identity (in this film, we believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, since his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message that this particular film brought. Casper was supposed to be more than just a moral play, or felt famous studios such as opening new horizons in "realism" animation. <br /> <br /> THERE'S GOOD BOOS. But the development of the plot involving the fox (who becomes a friend of Casper, but it fulfills a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give celebrities to studios - treat death with respect ... But, the stark image of Kasper's mourning is somewhat disturbing for children (although persuasion offers a happy ending, but I will not give up the end) Even for the 1940 standards. <br /> <br /> This may be a good drawing for parents to use to help explain death to children - but I will not put it in a VCR to get an annoying caricature break.
