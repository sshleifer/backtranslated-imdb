This film is absolutely stunning. Blade Runner - Noir future At best. The vision of Paris is magnificent, both recognized and visionary, with sweeping prospects, parts of Grunge and futuristic reality. <br /> <br /> The story line is very simple, with some surprises, but that's not the most I like about the movie. It is an optical therapy. <br /> <br /> The three-dimensional scroll was rendered in black and white (without grayscale!) with only one short spot of color, which is less difficult on the eyes than it seems. There are many camera shots "arty" - close-up and individual views - but this only adds to the mood of the film. Generally, you get an impression of a photo novel in the form of footage. <br /> <br /> I was initially under the impression that the movie had been visualized, and this was the level of animation and high detail in facial expressions. But unlike the "A Scanner Darkly" - which suffers (or is actually improved) - an inconsistent definition of personality (just see how the shape of the hair changes!) - the Renaissance is steady and accurate all the time. When the character is in the nearest picture, the added detail and texture can be seen, but when the details are deleted in the middle of the image or away, but not at the expense of personal identification. <br /> <br /> For me, the only downside of the film is that in one comment we were told that this is a one-off project. Such shame, I would also like to see more of the story of the future film - noir especially in this evolving style of painting. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English call him gorgeous too. <br /> <br /> All in all a great and highly recommended movie.
