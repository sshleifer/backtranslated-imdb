This is one of the best Jackies movies without the friends of the opera Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, it's one of the best openings in any movie and it goes on like this with Jackie showing some high quality stunts and the only critisim is that in the middle, The thing but it shows for 25 frantic minutes in the film, show the final balances what crazy Jackie Chan crazy just to keep movie addicts happy
