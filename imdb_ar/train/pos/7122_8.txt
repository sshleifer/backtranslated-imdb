In the wake of the Second World War, the right minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from the flagging flags that were a natural component of the war effort. "The Best Years of Our Lives" and even the "Gentlemen's Deal" examined the way the Americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war, but the "Marines pride" in Delmar defended them. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around the intelligent Philadelphia Garfield, John Garfield, who goes to war as commander of the Marines and after a nightmare night in the fox, with Japanese soldiers shouting "Marines, die tonight!" Grenade, throwing his girlfriend at home rather than having to rely on him after returning home. <br /> <br /> DeLamer Davies does not encourage his portrayal of these brave men, as they were, almost by accident, that they are there, in the fox, and when shot, they interact frequently with the tournaments, but they do the job, and then come to feel pity On the soul, dark sense of dark humor. Garfield is in an angry state of denial of his blindness and the film offers no excuse, "There is no free dessert for anyone in this world," as his companion tells him. Amy Gee, a Jew, played by Dane Clarke, reminds him, "In the war one gets it, and you, too ... Everyone has problems!" When I come back, some players will not hire me because my name is Diamond. <br /> <br /> Fantastic films are produced with films like this. If the first half of "Pride of the Marines" fails to rise to the right level and since then has evolved into a real work of art, you are crying and thinking, Suffering and hoping against hope, well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
