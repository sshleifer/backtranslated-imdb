A simple film at first, a simple film in the end. It contains that vulgar endless and pretentious, but most TV movies have this in any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job of being a con artist. Marriage between her and the women he works in, I feel a little strange, but I think, during the time that was set in it, it is unbelievable at all. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the modified "TV" version, even though the movie was produced and shown on "TV", but I find it even more surprising. But I feel if I see the whole piece, I'll probably give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still .... wonderful work. <br /> <br /> 7/10
