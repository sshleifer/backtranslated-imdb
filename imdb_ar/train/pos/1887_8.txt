Arthur is a rich middle-aged "kid" who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes to mind. He loves to boast about his riches and knows that he is naughty and spoiled. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune but falls in love with poor waitress Lisa Menelli (looks really weird). <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie. I saw this movie because the famous Indian movie "Sharabi" is based on Arthur's character. Although "Sharabi" is definitely inspired by Arthur, I think they are different. "Arthur" is just fun. Its very tacky at times. There are many wonderful lines in the film. It is not a laugh but it has some wonderful moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiance's father and continues to talk about "Moss". Dudley Moore definitely has some comic timing. It's very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing with a couple sitting in the hotel for a "small" country and still talking to the husband and wife in two different directions. John Gilgod won the Oscar for this film. I do not know this actor. I do not think he did a great job, but maybe I've seen more of his works if I've seen more of his work. The film contains some flat spots but not too long. Look forward to watching the sequel.
