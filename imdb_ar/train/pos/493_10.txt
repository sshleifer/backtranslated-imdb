I've been a fan of Star Trek for as long as I can remember. When they announced the layout and presentation of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The first show of institutions was worth the wait. It was done well with the perfect setting and a wonderful acting act by all characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect ship to show the beginnings of what many people like. <br /> <br /> Scott Bacolla was just as superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Gulin Block has given leading performance like Subcommander T'Pol. That only two people from this wonderful new crew will take us boldly to the history of the great Starfleet. <br /> <br /> Enterprise looks like a good chain worth watching, I recommend. See this.
