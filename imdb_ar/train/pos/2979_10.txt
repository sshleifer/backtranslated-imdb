There really is not much to say about this film ... it's hard, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Drawing out an outline (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> Losers from Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) are creating a new game of basketball, using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success, they make up, with the help of the billionaire, a professional baseball league where everyone gets the same salary and no team can change the cities. Coop & Remer, Milwaukee Beers are the only team that will stand in line for the changes to the main rules that the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) owner wants to make. > The Acting is awesome, as there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of "Southpark," Parker and Stone did a good job in their first real film. <br /> <br /> There are many funny moments in this movie, and I can not get close to naming them all. They never really leave, nor try to put some exotic drama to make it more dangerous. <br /> <br /> The favorite aspect of this film: soundtrack. it's great. I especially like "Take Me" and "Beer" by Real Fish. Very underestimated. <br /> <br /> In general, raw film, but very funny. 10/10 Black James Wolfson Johnston
