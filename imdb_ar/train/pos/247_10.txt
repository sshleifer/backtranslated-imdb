I loved this movie, because it showed they were not killed for fun but to save who they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job filming Ned and Joe. They have a few inappropriate but fast scenes but all right otherwise. The language is very moderate and sometimes you do not know it exists. This film shows that just being out of the law does not mean they are vicious killers! I hope people watch this film and get to know the important times in history such a film. There is one thing that surprises me in this film is that they were inspired by their shield from a book that Ned looked at and that this is how people remember it, from their armor. I hope people watch this movie and take care of it.
