A very angry and brave portrayal of part of the history of World War II, most of us in the United States did not have any idea at all. I like to have this on video. It was only shown on TV once as far as I know, again at 89 or 90. I have asked about this movie and most video shops do not even know about it. Great actresses everywhere, I hope to see her again. First class series.
