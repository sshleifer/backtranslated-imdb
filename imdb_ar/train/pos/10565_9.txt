In 1933, Dick Powell and Robbie Keller sang and danced through three Warner Bros. musical shows that gave audiences in the Depression a temporary distraction from their problems. The Golden Excavators of 1933, the 42nd Street and the Footlight Parade were placed in the Broadway theater world, and essentially the same theme should continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured choreography at Busby Berkeley, melody stops and many supporting players. <br /> <br /> All of them are classics that can be debated, but I have to acknowledge a clear preference for light because of the energy frequency and James Kani. William William of Gold Deers and Warner Baxter on 42nd Street are impressively attracted because the show's production chiefs, especially Baxter, like the burning Julian Marsh, are looking for the last box office crush. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney, which completes the hectic pace of Broadway music. It is an absolute whirlwind because it deals with production figures, unscrupulous partners and a gold exploration girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight as classic as it is. The script is punctuated by some of the sharp contestants provided by a wonderful support team including Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Jay Kepey, and especially Joan Blondell, who cuts each person according to his size. The Busby Berkeley dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and up-to-date and will be implemented soon before the arrival of the Hollywood Act at 34. Unfortunately, the 1930s and beyond will not see such a richly rich and transparent music. one more time. Raqqa and ethics were keen on that.
