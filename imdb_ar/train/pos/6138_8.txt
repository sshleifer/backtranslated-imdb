It is an old and wonderfully fun children's movie with the most attractive novice magician ever. Unlike many modern stories that seem to practice magic in the dark, this is just a magical story of the hidden focus of fun, wonder and magic. <br /> <br /> The story returned in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three children from Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rawlins were evacuated from World War II air raids. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who studies by correspondence to become an apprentice witch. Eglantin and three children use a bedside bed to travel to London on their bed. Here they face Emilys Brown, the principal of the correspondence school for magic training at Mays Price. Miss Price groups revolve around work on adaptations designed to revive non-living things. At the same time, they must also deal with a shady character called Buckman and his colleague Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Of course, Angela Lansbury was superbly loved as an exotic witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays the role of Mr. Brown, the director of the School of Ancient Magic, who has now turned into a magician in the street. This actor was previously represented as a father of children in Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a story reminiscent of quite a former Mary Bubbins, both fantastic fairy tales for children. This movie may not contain memorable music such as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts some attractive little tunes. Some were very important, but the film featured excellent special effects. All in all, the charming family entertainment story. It is unfortunate that contemporary children are very sophisticated for this beautiful and charming story, which should appeal to the child in us all.
