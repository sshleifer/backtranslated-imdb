All I can say is, if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you are not human! Even after watching it for the first time, I was hooked. It's a charming experience that's hard to describe, as I'm sure other fans will see it. After watching it, you will cry to think that these wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember! I think we all enjoy the great independence that these two women enjoyed. Although I was always impressed with Jackie Onassis's Kennedy, they did not stay in your heart as Big and Lital Eddie do. What a rare treat that these people know; I wish I had!
