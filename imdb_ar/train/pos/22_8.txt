If you progress quickly through the terrible singing, you will find a classic fantasy story underneath. Christopher Woking is very funny and surprisingly good at this role. His style of branding works well on Puss in Boots. Other actors are good for their parts. I did not find any of the terrible representation of the fake or embarrassing. It seems that the king in particular looks real, and I wonder if it is supposed to be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are typical in the 1980s, but at least they are not excessively fakes, like some of the computer fare we see today. In general, I recommend this film to children and adults who are a child at heart.
