I have watched this movie several times and all bad teachers like to give it ten out of ten, but I feel it would be unfair for other good films. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: perfect comedy. Is to bring out one of the greatest comic films of all time. Matao and Limon are quite identical and completely mismatched. The script is so sharp that you need to stop the bleeding. The story is known and has already been described in other comments. These performances offer exceptional performance, delightful girls and funny situations. There is not a single word on the horizon (a sign of Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be brilliant) and moving from one stage to another is smooth. They do not make it like this anymore. Egypt.
