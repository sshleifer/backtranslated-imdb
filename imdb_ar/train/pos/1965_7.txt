I found that this movie is very good in all areas. It was a wonderful representation of all the characters, especially Mrs. Stone and Maurice. Tramell's personality becomes more intelligent and more psychologically twisted by the minute. The plot is interesting although this film is more of a mind play among the main characters and how Katherine continues to write it in new ways and distortions of her novels. The setting was also fantastic and the atmosphere of the entire film was as ambiguous and perfect as the masterpiece. I'm going to watch this movie now, it's worth better than it got from the audience, which was misled by some horrible reviews about the movie (before it even starts) ..... you will not regret it, if you go ...
