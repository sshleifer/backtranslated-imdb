The 1939 film attempted to take advantage of Michael Cortez's film Angels with Dirty Faces. According to Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how these children have been tamed compared to what is going on with young people in America's inner cities today. <br /> <br /> The film is worth watching only because of Anne Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who have shown that they are well connected. "Dead end" children have larger parts where the plot focuses on them rather than on older people. <br /> <br /> In a strange way, the burning was used in the same way that some realtors used in later years here in New York. It was the quickest way to transform a property without thinking about the social problems it created. In today's climate with a lot of guns around there is a new fact. The young people of the story seemed just mujahideen instead of criminals. How times change!
