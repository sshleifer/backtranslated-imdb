What can you say about a display of this size? The definition of "Soprano" redefined the definition of television as we know it. He broke all the rules, setting new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, writing, directing, for me, and most of all, acting. You will see this show that you realize that these characters are not real. Representation fools you into thinking of a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show because it's violent. It's not about violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you are, you see, a fan. For me, I do not like when people refer to the show, show about the Mafia. For me, it's a show about the family. A family, across generations, encounters a mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of the show. This is what TV should be. Here. Complex characters of stunning representation, wonderful story lines of brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? Display sets excellence, and dare to be different.
