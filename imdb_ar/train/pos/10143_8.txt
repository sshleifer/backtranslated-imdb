This was a wonderful episode, one of the best seasons. I dropped the right horror for change, a story far superior to average Ministry of Health rings, if there is such a thing. The man's wife burned almost to death in the wreckage of a tragic car he was driving. His airbag worked, he did not do her. It is incontrovertibly burnt (a wonderful, bittersweet makeup) and has little chance of living without full skin grafting. But, even in a coma, she is still dying but she has restored modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. The massacre of course, as well as some very severe killings, as well as some very exciting scenes. What more can you ask for, you may ask? Well, not much, since this child has everything, and the end is very cynical, you should leave a smile on most viewers faces. I liked the direction of Rob Schmidt too, he has a great talent of horror. Excellent ring, this is one I definitely buy.
