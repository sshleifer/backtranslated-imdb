Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any other channel. The presenter of this candid presentation for adults was sometimes the winner of the BAFTA four times and won the British Comedy Award (also nominated twice). Graham Norton is the ideal gay host for such a good show. He had one or more celebrities in the middle. They basically had an idea for adults that would either be fair, insulting or funny to the guest, but others were not with weak hearts. They had women playing the recorder with their parts, men using their dicks to play xylophone, women who wore up in the bathroom, men who wore trousers or without them under the weight, and many serious but fun ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy it! She won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (program or series), won the British Comedy Awards for the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), the Best Comedy Talk Program, won the Emmy Award for Episode 18 (?) And won the National Television Awards twice for most Popular talk. The number 52 was in the 100 greatest funny moments. very good!
