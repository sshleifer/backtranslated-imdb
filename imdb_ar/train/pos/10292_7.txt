Let me begin by saying that I am very impressed with Kari. Although I will admit I have not seen all his movies * Cough * Magical * Cough *. Bruce was exulting. None of the other reviews really reviewed how the cheese came to the end, I do not know what the book was thinking. Somehow I could not help but feel that this film was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Steve Corell in The Daily Show is HILARIOUS as well as the rest of the actors. Watch Bruce Almighty if you're a fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a funny, lightweight comedy.
