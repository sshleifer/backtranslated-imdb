Masayuki Su, who directed this wonderful film, is in turn. After "Fancy Dance" Decent and Classic (in Japan, anyway) Sumo Comedy College "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his huge strides with stunning success. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting. We both laugh a lot (Naoto Takenaka hilarious, as in two previous films of Sue) and a true root of the characters. But the big reward for me is the way this film gives the viewer in Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has the talent to show real activities with an entertaining style. The result is a movie that will encourage you, make you laugh, make you think, and both will delight you and give you insight into Japan today. <br /> <br /> Also look for the eight main actors from Shiko Funjatta, as they all reappear in different roles, from the supporting characters (Takenaka) to short-short characters (many).
