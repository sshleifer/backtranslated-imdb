Every Bette Davis movie deserves the experience. Before Davis shared Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage", she was in more than one film. The legend says Davis was "stolen" from Oscar in 1935 because of her performance as a Kenyan-speaking waitress, an unmarried mother and the use of her manipulative boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story tells AFI that Izzat Davis was awarded the first Academy Award for Joyce Heath for "Dangerous." I imagine Davis fans in "Human Humanage" who agree with the Oscar-winning legend will appear in contrast to my critique of the 1934 film in which AFI did not win the performance and "Dangerous" of 1936, which won the first Academy Award in 1937. > <br /> I've tried to watch all the Bette Davis animations, TV interviews, videos, World War II ads and TV shows in popular series. In the end, it is easy to understand why this film Human Human Bondage gave Davis the chance to run for its performance. She was just 25 when the movie was finished and was about to reach the red carpet in Hollywood. The public began to notice that Pitt was starring for her performance in "Of Human Bondage". This is what makes it their legendary performance. But Rko saw her greatness in "the man who played God" and borrowed from Warner to play with Rogers. <br /> <br /> I will go with the AFI, too late, after almost 41 years of an ingenious decision to award the Davis Academy Award for Best Actress Oscar for "Dangerous" two years later. By doing so, the agency may have an active role in highlighting the best in one of Hollywood's most 20th century talent representatives. Because, from the "human bondage", onwards, Davis knew for sure that she had to go deep into herself to find the offerings that the golden statue had earned. Undoubtedly, it deserves more than 2 Oscars. Up to 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" offers an ideal variation in the depth of the Davis profile. Because, in "Dangerous" (1936), she became the greatest actor of the twentieth century. Davis is very good like Joyce Heath, a dead center on the red carpet. While in the film "Of Human Bondage", Davis was on the edge of the abyss, still on the sidewalk and ready to take off in the rest of her 60-year career. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not giving her the legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of producing a star, she gave the actress an incentive to reach beyond stardom in her soul in the greatest work of the talented actor. <br /> <br /> It is well known that its contemporary counterpart opponent was Joan Crawford; a star whose performance still does not reach the Davis level. So Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is a "star" radio host as well. Many people on the stage and the silver screen are stars. Become a little great actors. The main difference between them is something that Bette Davis can feel: the difference between wanting to do great acting or becoming a star. <br /> <br /> Try comparing these two movies as I have, and watch one after the other. Maybe you'll know what AFI did. Davis was about to become one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo and achieved her goal at the time she was 27 years old. I spent the next 50 years in setting the tape to a point where it was not reached. . . Until now. <br /> <br /> If AFI had sent her a message saying that she had reached the movie "Of Human Bondage," Davis's life history as a great actor may have been presented to the star star, instead.
