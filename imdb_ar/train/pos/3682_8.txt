Often, you encounter movies of this kind as a mixed bag of great work along with a light Dravill to fill the run time. Whether that support is great or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this area. I think I can really say that the whole film is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transformations and the wonderful ending sequence, and the integration of characters together in a final scene of love in Paris, I think the film would have suffered if any gear had been removed. True, there are certainly a few positions that cast a shadow over the rest, but in the end I have a permanent image, even if it is just a fraction of a second of each short article. Love takes many forms, and the talent here goes up to the occasion, to surprise and stir the audience by cutting the hair and elegance of many emotion aspects. <br /> <br /> Cartier des Infants Rogges: Maggie Gilenhall surprises as a medicine shooting actress in Paris and meeting her dealer. The disclosure at the conclusion makes you somewhat unbalanced because the temptation in the hands of change. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (re-establish a relationship from the old film Cassavettes?) a sharp and ironic wit as they meet to discuss impending divorce. What their conversation is true and what is just the anger of the other, everything is fun, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us an impressive picture of the love behind religious and ethnic differences. It's a sweet little story about shy love between two people who are obviously in touch, but are unable to speak out loud. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I will admit the disappointment that Sylvain Chumit did not get a moving sequence. However, the story of this live representation falling in love in a prison in Paris has the same exotic nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers adheres to her strange sense of humor and makes some beautiful laughter. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells performance without speaking a word. His reactions to the verbal abuse of an indignant French man are invaluable. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here is a tragic picture of a couple about love in order to return to the face of the tragedy. Sergio Castellito and Miranda Richardson move as the couple deals with the problems and find out how strong the true love bond is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: An amazingly funny little story of the master of horror, Wes Craven. Oscar Wilde's little joke can add strength to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be doing the amazing long exercises he is doing in "The Children of Men" with the tale of two people in love and another street walk. While Nick Nolte and Ludvine Sannier are finally coming close, we also find the true context of their conversation about "forbidden love." <br /> <br /> Port du Chauzi: A very surrealistic look at the charm of Paris. Perhaps this is the most unusual entry, but it is interesting that you can not look away from the madness that followed. Do not get angry with your Asian beauty, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that goes through roles that seem stagnant for years. A little variety of Bob Hoskins is necessary to shoot. <br /> <br /> Cartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love between feeding hours. I do not know whether I'm happy with Elijah Ellig Wood as a result. This beautifully strange retort and muted voice to allow the red blood vitality, this is strange, but then is love. <br /> <br /> XIV: Leave it to Alexander Pine's strange humor to add some depth to this story about an American in Paris to find love. Her harsh, uneducated French is a very stark contrast to the authentic dialects we have heard so far? Far enough to be completely funny and honest to the story. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the proceedings. Paris can be a common city because of everyday activities such as finding a parking place, but when he discovers love, his prisoner will take anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno shows brilliantly that the love of a child is through her hidden performance, where the story is told by singing to a small child, but completely different each time. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite story of the bunch. Seydou Boro and Isa Maga are simply wonderful. The cyclical nature of the story and how it combines the fate between the two cases together until Buru finally asks for coffee. Sometimes love at the last minute is sufficient to accept the individual's leaving this land. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: One of the best stories about a mother trying to overcome the death of her little son. Juliette Pinochet destroys as a desperate mother, a last glimpse of her son, Willem Dafoe is an oddly beautiful cowboy style that gives her the chance. <br /> <br /> Voborg San Denis: Sometimes one needs to think he has lost love to accept that he has not invested fully in the relationship. Melchior recalls his attempt to find where he has been through a series of sharp and quick cuts from his meeting with Natalie Portman to finally "see" what he needs. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave it to Gus Van Sant presents us with a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films always deal with a form of alienation. A photographer from Elephant is an American who works in Paris and is a catalyst for Gilles Osbella's works on love and soulmates. Sometimes one does not need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in periods of downtime.
