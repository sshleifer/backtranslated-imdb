I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if you had made a bad or a good purchase. This is the last result of my whole film from start to finish. Michelle Rodricks, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, made a great show and she looked pretty and attractive, and at the same time conducted a real study into the art of how acting really performed. Diana did not like her life at home, especially her father, because of her mother's abuse. I decided to get boxing training at a local gym in Brooklyn and are not well accepted by male boxers. In her high school, there is a lot of friction between her classmates and men. There are lots of procedures in the ladies' bathroom and references to the special parts of the men. If you love boxing, seeing sexy hot gal do wonders in the ring and the boys' ways to know them, this is the movie for you.
