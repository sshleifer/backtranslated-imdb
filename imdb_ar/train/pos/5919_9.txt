Street Fight is a wonderful piece of wild satire. This is not a movie you're watching just for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it has some loud moments. It's a movie you see when you need food to think about. <br /> <br /> The rejection of this film as simply racist is to miss the whole idea. This is not just a satire of the Southern song, but also a critical comment on the biases that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group filmed in the film is portrayed as ugly cartoons of its stereotypes, which in turn represent wonderful cartoons of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the director illustrates the absurdity of these deeply entrenched beliefs. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person who wants to acknowledge the rumor of prevailing prejudices that American culture still exists, and if you're not afraid to look ahead, it might be right for you.
