I saw "talk easily" one evening and thought it was good, but I lost something. Buster Keaton may have been kicked out recently, or handed over to a leading lady. The next day I kept thinking about the film. I could not get the song spinning out of my head, I kept trying to remember better the Thalma first scene, and I thought Keaton might have done some funny waterfalls and physical comedy. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a chorus girl trying to convince Buster and Jamie of her sexual attraction. Very funny scene, excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. So I watched another scene, their show opened on Broadway. The buster in his innocent innocence burns all the action. Again, I was laughing loudly, and I appreciate the clown and ketone clown. The next night I saw the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: it's great! It's exciting! It's sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dances! Durant sings! Keaton speaks! Sure it is not poifect ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
