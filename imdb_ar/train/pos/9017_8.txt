This film is a wonderful work in the portrayal of the plight of ALS (Lou Geirig disease). The subject is done with compassion as well as humor. Helena Bonham Carter is very convincing as someone with ALS so much that I found it hard to believe that she was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, a wonderful actor, lives up to expectations as a crooked artist who misbehaves and has to offer companionship to Helena as part of "community service" as an alternative to prison time. Watching the evolution of the relationship between these two is a treat from start to finish. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the wonderful performances. One comes to deeply care for the two of them.
