Chuck Jones 'Hare Hurstead' is a fast-paced cartoon, often a joy. Pitting Bugs Bunny Against the manager of a strange yellow-skinned apartment store that wants to be stuffed, Hare Conditioned takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setup. Bugs take chase and chase through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gambit from which various departments wear any clothing tied to this part of the store. However, this large mismatch is overcome by a truly inspired sequence of lifts, where Bugs, the renegade as an elevator boy, deceives the store manager to get the elevators or stop them relentlessly at the wrong time. It's a wonderful climatic piece that unfortunately gives way to a final gag that is not too funny. By that time, however, "Hare Conditioned" had made its mark as one of the best chasing films, filled with wild energy. As Bugs became more accurate in some other cartoons of this period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that it could still be as attractive as the chaotic character.
