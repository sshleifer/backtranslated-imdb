First, I would like to make another correction to review this film, which said that the last musical won the Best Picture Academy Award was "Gigi" in 1958. This is a misrepresentation where she won the "West Side Story" in 1962. She won "My Beautiful Lady" in 1965 and won " Voice of Music "the following year. However, this movie is very cool! The story has changed somewhat, but it is because of the restrictions they imposed on a stage they did not change again to get a copy. However, I do not mind. In fact, I think the whole production flows better than the novel. I love Nancy and she brings Oliver with her to the bridge with her and is killed there instead later in the apartment. It's the fine things in this film that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr Bambell and Mrs Bambell first started out of the Conservatives' office. Underline that wonderful moment. The three favorite actors of this film are Jack Wilde, who plays the best film in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagen (this character is much better than it is in the book) and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest and most elegant version of Nancy . The only reason I give this movie 9 instead of 10 is because of the two big production numbers, "Concider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy". I always hate when the design of musical dances was meant to look like everyday work and jobs. It seems terrible and cowardly, especially when they dance at the London Meat Company. They had to do choreography regularly for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
