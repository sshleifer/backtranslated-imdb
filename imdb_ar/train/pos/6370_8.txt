To my surprise, I really enjoyed the latest animation from Disney. The film made its lowest point, but I generally felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also good to see an animated film from Disney that was not musical. I was about to be pushed to the border with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave something a comfort music. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy is not completely neglected (not Hercules); it is so subtle that they still make children laugh while not making adults feel dizzy or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One animation was disappointed. With all the great animated movies happening outside Disney Studios, you'll think they'll move and pick up a bit. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the movie was amusing and definitely worth a trip to the double. <br /> <br />
