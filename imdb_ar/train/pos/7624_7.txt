The film "Willard" is more like a starring role in the representation of obsolete characters (in this case, a bit lower to the level of Les Tremayne, which puts the only performance excellence I have seen) in the role of the man who His life is unbalanced and he later decides to use his animal friends to avenge those who have sinned. Yes, this is one of those films where everyone is so dingy, so cheerful when they die, and the choice of actors, locations, etc. may be a better way of giving the film an atmosphere of decomposition. <br /> <br /> The character of Tremayne is "Snakey Bender", which is certainly the most interesting thing in the film: the old snake-snakes collector with John Philip Souza's music. When the local preacher stresses his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as a bait for his snakes, and his girlfriend marries a stripper (which annoys the ceremony on Wednesdays Wednesday) continues to ferment during the process creating an unforgettable pile of clunkers under the abyss where the wreckage was thrown after disposal Of its unfortunate owners. There is one fun game you can play while watching "Snakes" - betting on cars that will land on a cliff. <br /> <br /> All in all, very cheap and exploitative, but it will be really much fun for fans of these types of movies.
