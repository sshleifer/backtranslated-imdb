Many of the educational films are nothing more than a fool of the mind, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" makes fun of them ("Why study industrial arts?"). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually good. It's all about blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything about him, but he does a good job explaining everything, keeping him serious but fun. I think you can always count on June Foray (the most famous is Rocky the Squirrel, they play deer here). <br /> <br /> Since finding "Hemo the Magnificent" may be hard to find, the best place to see it is "Gremlins": a row watching it while gremlin forms.
