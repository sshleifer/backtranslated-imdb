All the talent Mr. Suraj Bargatia showed in his first three films, I thought was all coincidental because his first major four, Divi Hoon, was so bad. But I must say it was not an accident. This talented guy and the way he did by Vivah is just wonderful. Directly from the first scene affects you. The sequences between Shahid and Amrita are fascinating. The chemistry between these two representatives gives a glimpse of that between SRK and Kajol. As usual, Alok Nath is like a good and loving father. But his film is Shahid Amrita. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although the witness seems young at marriage age, but he does a good job in shy but morally strong care. This film will particularly appeal to those who have gone through these beautiful moments in their lives. All in all. Hats for Mr. Sorag Bargatia ...
