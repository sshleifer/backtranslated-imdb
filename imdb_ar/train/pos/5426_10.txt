It's time to release Gunga Din on DVD. I can not say how many times I've seen this wonderful film, but I never get tired of it. Major actors worked together well. Victor McGlagen (Sergeant McKensney), Gary Grant (Sgt Keter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Sergeant Valentin) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I can not overcome their exploits in India. Your first look at the three sergeant is when you see them taking part in fighting with other soldiers on the map of the so-called treasure. The three sergeants are sent on an exploratory trip to find out what happened to the line of communication, entering a mostly deserted city - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They are taking part in the necessary reforms and some of them will soon find "residents" in hiding. Shortly after they were attacked by a group of madmen who barely fled to the base. <br /> <br /> Later they are sent on another mission that gives Sgt Cutter the chance to go looking for gold with debt. They found a gold temple and were trapped by evil Cali supporters. Din is sent to bring in help and get caught on the cutter. Soon McKinney and Ballentine arrived with Din, and were caught in a big way. <br /> <br /> In the face of murder, they are helplessly watching over their faces to save them. The evil actors are watching and they are about to show their surprise attack when a wounded religion ascends to the golden dome and blows its luster that alerts the British to the ambush. In doing so, Dean was shot dead. <br /> <br /> The evil soldiers attack and are quickly defeated. In the end, Dean is honored because he became the honorary corporal of the British Army.
