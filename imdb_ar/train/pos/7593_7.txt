The movie is too fucking silly. <br /> <br /> But would you expect a high-resolution intellectual film based on a slut called Slam Dunk? really? Jay Chu was not the most exciting thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near a wonderful level for someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow to produce it? No it is not. Was it quite entertaining if you only take it in terms of surface value? at all. It is a film about some Chinese idols and musicians who can play basketball with an unrealistic level of experience. There is a dude-style paranoid dude and an idiot scheming man who shares Jay Chu in all this. The interest of love. It is an equation but in fact, stop disbelief for a while. Come on. Call it kung fu dunk. What do you really think of logging in for? If you're watching it yourself - I found myself a copy with some translations of Engrish that made the film close to the unintelligible conversation, but we laughed a lot. They seem to have been very attached to Jerusalem and Numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, cried, and cried. I was watching him again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this scene of fighting in the bar. Well designed and well designed. I especially enjoy a lit grid lit plix - I would love to play on one of these. <br /> <br /> A spot is enough for me, but I dig on the trash can.
