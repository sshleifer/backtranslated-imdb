Most of the complaints I have heard from this film go back to one thing: it is not. Yes, the actors and staff is essentially the same. Yes, Kitamura rephrases some of the scenes in the fighting scenes that come in the second half of the film, but this is where the similarities end. Versus is mainly based abroad, with Kitamura's ability to produce an interesting B movie in natural locations. Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small narrow spaces. Here the design of art goes to your face, and what is artistic design! We dealt with many very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to those spaces. The main difference is that we do not get too much action here until the end of the film. It was for everything about movement and quiet, and here the focus is much more on characters, attitude and tampering with your mind. For this reason, Alive is a more interesting film than Versus. You can not broadcast it and move to a random scene for five to ten minutes of brilliant zombie blood shed, but you'll stick to the screen for about two hours watching its interaction with some really important characters. <br /> I am now trance that I ordered a DVD despite some naysay. You must also! But be sure to realize that this animal is different from Versus - it is often slow and requires little thought to make the most of it. I hope that Media Blasters will choose the R1 DVD version!
