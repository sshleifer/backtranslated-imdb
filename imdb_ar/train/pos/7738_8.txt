After dark, My Sweet is a great modern narrator, full of unnatural characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly great light in the past two or three decades has taken place in the south, where men and women are glittering, too. why? Because it is hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks softer (at least men do it - the sweaty women leave me stained). <br /> <br /> Anyway - there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of everything that Noir should have - a steady pace (although some people with attention disorders refer to it as "slow"), and clearly painted characters They are simple), tons of air. Noir, if any, revolves around mood and attitudes. That is why the greats do not have the traditional definitions of your "great" behavior (see Bogart, Metum, Hort and Nicholson - they were not) and their characters (anything that was not true - but they were elegant and sensual and the crime of the film is exactly what you want). Or fast paced adventures (again it seems that all the big noir on burning is as slow as a cigarette). Great Noir create an environment and you only inhabit with characters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet, you can do this - and lets you enjoy some of the most interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bowers and Cooley are curious - they never let the audience know what they're reading - Patrick and Darren (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are very idealistic, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the basic outlines of personality and give them depth and draw our sympathy. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the world of noir (there is hardly any ambiguity here - most of them thrill), but this one is strong. If there is anything, the "simple conspiracy" has to do with Jim Thompson writing more than anything else. With Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he has avoided the tales of Hammett and Chandler tired of simpler stories and more distorted characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you'll see instantly (from the title) what's going on around it. When it comes to Thompson, it's not about what's going on around it, but about how it revolves (in the words of Roger Ebert). So, in fact, the relatively simple kidnapping plot is not the point, and if you do not like it, you do not have jokes. <br /> <br /> Why is this 8-star film rather than a 10-star film the reason for female progress? It's not bad, in itself, but it's not Angelica Houston or Annette Penning (see Adapting The Grifters to Jim Thompson if you do not know what I'm talking about - besides being a better film and you should start there for contemporary Noir - Blood Simple has been named the best since Chinatown). She simply does not have the pieces (or looks like that) and although she and Patrick have some chemistry, I do not own them. So there.
