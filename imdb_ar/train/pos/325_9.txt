It is a wonderful film - especially when compared to sometimes seriously serious filmmakers with political thinking. A film that can easily combine sex, gender, politics and art is rare these days. While little optimism can not be restored in the 1960s, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the wonderful energy and magic of the film. I do not know what those who call the film "boring" - there are so many things stuffed into it that it does not remain the same film for more than 15 minutes at a time.
