The opening left me thriving with their creativity - the revised version of the Archer's logo, the primary disclaimer, and the way the camera waits for the universe. It is strange to think that "it is a wonderful life" appeared in the same year. It is not a big coincidence: the 1940s were full of heaven and earth movies; but the blazing cotton wool nebula and the gentle angels of competition seem torn, the best thing that moves silently, when placed next to Alfred Junge's vision. <br /> <br /> It still looks great all the time, with more and more striking ideas sprouting up on us. I do not like mixing colors with black and white in general. One of the visual planners always seems ugly when placed next to the other. Not so here. Powell melts color in monochrome and monochrome in color as if it were the most natural thing in the world, just changing the paintings. Color, black and white photography can stand alone. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... this may be the best text for a burger, or at least the conclusion could have been the logical result of past events. Otherwise, it has become narrow, but with more I can mention here. Were the heavenly things real or imaginary? Perhaps Carter had dreamed the imagination that was, as it really was, true.) Everyone says we aim not to ask this question or answer it, but I do not see why. I'm sure we aim to ask the question. The film gives us clues as to what the answer is - in fact, the problem is that there are a lot of clues that seem to initially point to different directions. The fact that other things should occupy our attention also does not mean that this should not concern us either. As I said before, there's a lot going on. <br /> <br /> Think of the scene in which Abraham Farlan (the trial lawyer in Haven) plays a radio broadcast for a cricket match and says disdainfully: The voice of England, 1945. "Dr. Reeves (defense) acknowledges the exhibition with great embarrassment, then produces One of his songs: the blues song from America, which Farlan listens to like a lemon in his mouth, Reeves looks arrogant. <br /> <br /> Well, I do not see why it is absurd to condemn blues music - that's not what Powell and Pressburger do However, while the song is playing, we get a shot of the American soldiers who listen to it: many of them touch their heads to the rhythm, There is something valuable about the song and Reeves and Farlan do not know what it is, Reeves probably knows that, all the English fans (and all the Australian and Indian fans, etc.) know without being told that there is something of value In the cricket also; and while Reeves understands it, he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence blues music, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing and understanding everything else. <br /> <br /> A last thing. David Neven found a bit cold, without the charisma he later acquired in his career; however, I do not think a film took my heart very quickly after the event began, as did the film.
