I first saw this film in the early 1990s when it was first released. The room with view was also fresh out. April was enchanted to make a lot! I found it more realistic and earthy, the characters more credulous to being "normal". By the end of the film, I felt the same feeling I felt when I first saw the BBC's production of pride and prejudice. I was anxious for characters to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom, or love. You have a feeling that Italy is far from everything I have ever known, that they are too decadent to risk and leave everything that is wet and strait. But in the spring of April, everyone's life falls apart and disintegrates (in line with Victorian corsets) and is slowly rebuilt to the satisfaction of all. What a small gem of the film! How come the order is more unknown?
