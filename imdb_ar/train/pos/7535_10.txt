700 Club offers a great look at world events. Some described it as deceitful or cheesy. I find the program informative and inspiring. It is natural for many to throw mud at a program that has proved successful. There are very few offers that can point to a track record of success in the world of television media, and 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson has made the mistake of saying that someone should be assassinated, I find it strange that many people will literally travel on their own to get into the vehicle of criticism. I have certainly said some foolish things in my life. Certainly I would be willing to tolerate Mr. Robertson because he made a wonderful presentation.
