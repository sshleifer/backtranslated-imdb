Viggo Mortensen plays the role of a new guest in a haunted prison where the engineer (playing well by Lynn Smith) has a terrible secret that could be the reason for the slaughter of many prison guards and prisoners because of a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the person who knows the secret and is afraid for his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of the action films from Stallone or Van Dam or big-scale dramas such as Shoshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However I did not expect a ghost story more like the third exorcist. However, the prison is an effort in the air, and it is certainly the best film about the life of Rene Harlin. The film is creepy and has some good representation from a group of unknowns (at the time). Lynn Smith is the best because his guard is not the usual evil clich√©s, but he is nervous and volatile and adds some credibility to a film that is far beyond expectations. <br /> <br /> *** From 4- (Hassan)
