He has only seen this show several times, but it will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it is very difficult to find this anywhere to buy however there seems to be endless repetitions of things like friends! I think it's very hard to be in England ..? <br /> <br /> They say the assessment was low or was it a Bakersfield B complaint themselves? Maybe it was just too clever for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, about the only comedy I'd love to see again but it's almost impossible to find. I hear it being or repeated on another network? But unfortunately not finished here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Clever.
