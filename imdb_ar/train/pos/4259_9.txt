Solino really moved me with her deeply drawn characters. While it was a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. What I most like in the film is how I can identify with the feelings that Gigi was going through especially when he had to bring his mother back to her hometown in Italy and miss the film festival awards where he entered the movie. The vision of this character, who struggled hard between his artistic dream and his instinctive sense of his mother's duty, was very frustrating. Even in the end when he made another attempt to communicate with his father, he was very brave. As in real life, most parents can never cross their walls to reach their children. So I was able to get to know Giancarlo, the brother, whose older brother was self-confident and had a lot of insecurity. A really beautiful film made me laugh and cry.
