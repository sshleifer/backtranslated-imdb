John Garfield plays a Marine wounded by a hand grenade while fighting for Guadalcanal, who must learn how to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypes about blindness, which is sure to be a burden to everyone. Hospital staff and wounded colleagues can not reach the Marines. His homecoming gesture can not be played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his fears, self-pity, and prejudices. It is a complex role played by Garfield in an unforgettable performance that keeps one watching despite the current melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he was in the nest of a submachine gun trying to repel the advancing Japanese soldiers in a glorious battle at night, and later a sequence of dreams in the hospital where he sees himself walking in a train platform with white cane, dark glasses, All the while his girlfriend walks back away from the camera.
