The man in the moon is an old and dramatic drama about the world of agriculture in the 1950s. 14-year-old Reese Witherspoon crashes on a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of this family forever. The fifties of the 20th century were conjured up here and give you a screenplay of characters you care about almost immediately. Witherspoon is already beginning to show the Oscar-winning talent she will develop in this early role, while London is making a fascinating young man. Warfield imparts a quiet maturity to the role of the elder sister that is also effective. Glory to Sam Waterstone and Tess Harper, who play the role of the parents of girls and Gil Strickland, who play my mother in London. I was unexpectedly impressed by this quiet, moving drama that evokes strong feelings and gives a deeper meaning to the term "family ties".
