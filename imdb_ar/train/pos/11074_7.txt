Not the complete disaster that British critics have claimed and no misunderstanding masterpiece in a few of its fans insist that Revolver is at least a brilliant attempt by Jay Ritchie to add a little bit of grandeur. But then, there is nothing more disdainful than an ambitious film that bites more than can be chewed, especially a film that uses film / professional movie frame. As expected from Luc Besson's name on credits as a product, there is a specific element in "Cinema de look" on this subject: In a fictional world in which America and Britain are intertwined, it looks great. It has a wonderful pair of creative, from him. But it is clear that Richie wants to do more than just rephrase his own films for a quick cost, and spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If any problem is that he tries to throw a lot of effects (a few Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of chess principles), decorations and techniques, scattering the screen with quotations: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of writing on photographs of victims' Mobs, and sometimes it seems as though he has never read a wealth cookie he did not want to convert into a movie. Instead of being a commercial declaration of Kabbalism, it is in fact a combination of the interrelated principles of trade, chess and trust in deception, which mostly stem from the difficult trick of making philosophy within reach while concealing the film's central irregularities. The last third is where most of the problems can be found. Jason Statham (literally) faces the enemy with a lot of ambition but is not always quite successful in a cross-section to show the contrast between external people and internal fear and anger, but it happens. Much. Not worth starting a new debt, but I was surprised that he did not get a distributor in the US. Maybe they found Tan Ray Liotta fake intentionally so scary?
