Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie .. The songs were a great success but the elite category went past govinda movies and then coz to watch govinda and karishma movies were not in this part of the movie but in any case many people liked it because The series of these films rocked the nineties and were mostly successful ... Today I was watching them again after a long time and I remembered that there was a long queue of people and the riots they created when aa euuuoo appeared on the screen .... dresses were govinda and karishma complement To each other (the worst duo of that time) well charisma in the late nineties But Giovinda was still very loyal to his designer as his sense of dress was still the same ... but at that time, everything was mixed up, everything was good .. everything was working and slowly the elite elite understood what it was The fun that was missing then ..... There was no look back to this jodi as it continued to make those Indian carry on the chain .. by a few but they were loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good time with nothing to rent or watch on TV, I do not think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst at its best. <br /> <br /> I still watch these movies when I get the time to be unable to stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have fun while there are times when we all live in love and stupidity especially when it is done by kings of their time , It is certainly viewable ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
