Despite the care of George Lucas, this charming and perfectly original fantasy in the film "Lumage" is still far from the usual children's fare, like anything Ralph Vacchi made in his reign. Skillfully designed characters such as a dog that turns into the shape of Ralph (one of the two disgruntled and disgruntled protagonists), Synonamess Botch and Rod Rescueman (the supernatural novice hero) breathe life into a unique intelligent concept of Frivoli vs. Murkwood or, the eternal battle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, MOR songs should not be played on soundtracks but in some way. It's really unfortunate that I had to watch it through a great-looking take-off (drawn from a TV show) of the uncensored version? Is there also a more moderate variable that reduces the language of its VHS version? Because the movie is not available on the DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selek and David Vincher work on this image with secondary capabilities.
