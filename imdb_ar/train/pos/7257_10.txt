The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and did not know much about it until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it to some of the producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dubie was my friend, I heard about it. I just wrote a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might want to make another draft. I also asked if I could see the original because I lost it. I was told, it was too late. So I did the only thing I could do under these circumstances and took my name. I had no idea what they had done in a practical scenario. Then I was invited to see the final film. I was so impressed that I quickly asked to re-put my name again. It's a pretty piece of art, from the first hastily written draft, I expected to be asked to do more work on it; maybe it would not be good. Want to see the original again if anyone knows where it is? I also love watching the movie again, I've only seen it once at a small show theater in Soho.
