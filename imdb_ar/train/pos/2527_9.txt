That's what I call "pre-science fiction; science fiction". Do not get better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly moving "mood" animation. These are the real artists at their best, as with the story. <br /> <br /> Karlov does a great job as a scientist who finds himself stuck in a wave of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I've caught on to the idea of ​​watching a man drown in the three concepts mentioned earlier. I felt sad and at the same time I was fascinated with the two stars as they did in themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the type of animated image that is thrown back. This time Harrison Ford put in the Karloff part and perhaps Kiefer Sutherland as the role of Bella Lagosi. It may be possible to do this with almost the same quality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best produced by Hollywood EVER. As I said, it is not improving. Not possible.
