Fever Stadium is a fun movie enough. It has lots of ridiculous moments (including a very annoying shower scene). Like most romantic comedy films, there is a "dead zone" in the middle where heavy objects "break up with me," but otherwise remain funny until the end. > Although the plot revolves around intolerance to Red Sox, it is not burdened with sport. You do not have to be happy to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've been a fan of Red Sox since I was too young. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
