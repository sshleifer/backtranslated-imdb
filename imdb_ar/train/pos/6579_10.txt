Methinks Best version of Quo Vadis screen? since when. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and clear as in the book, sometimes lopsided and loses the suspense between delicate aesthetic details. But the film is "really weird" and beautiful, and has a puzzle and style, certainly no other versions - with R.Taylor and the new version of Poland. It contains the air of Roman decay, the beauty of pagan retreat and Christian infantry. At least I think she has). Brandware, Forrest and Ciudov did an excellent job of photographing their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to have been the biggest success in the cast (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the essence of this deceased world (IMHO). This is. That 's how you guys happened
