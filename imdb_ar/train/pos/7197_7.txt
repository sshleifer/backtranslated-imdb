There were several films about Zorro, some made in Europe, for example, Alan Dillon. This role was also played by prominent actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me it was always the best Red Hadley. This series gives you an opportunity to see an interesting West, where only the real villain, Don del Oro, will be discovered at the end. The series also has a good performance for many B movie actors such as Ed Cobb, Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, and the eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and very good performance Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zoro.
