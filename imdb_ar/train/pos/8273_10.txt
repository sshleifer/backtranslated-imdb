If you want Scream or anything like the horror product with the big studio we're charging these days, do not bother. This well-written film made me think of everything he said. The importance of myth in our lives to make sense, how children explain the world (and violence in it), looting of the environment and ignorance of its history and its myths ... all here, but not clearly on the surface. You can technically call it a "beast film" even though Wendigo does not take a physical shape until the end, so it is up to you and your beliefs for what happens with the legendary soul / beast. Some elements of standard excitement are for those who are just looking for basics and the film never fills up, although in fact, the less you see your creature, the better. Fessenden has successfully pursued George Romero's tradition of using this type as a discussion forum and continuing to keep us away.
