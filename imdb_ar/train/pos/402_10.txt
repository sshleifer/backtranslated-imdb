I have seen before Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain. In this film, the setting takes place in the mountains of China, Legend of Zu looks like another dimension !! Thank you for using Tsui Hark Intense for CGI effects. He is able to picture his vision of the mountains that float above the clouds, the land where the creatures fly freely, and the forces that range from razor blades to razor blades, split swords, and the Orb. <br /> <br /> Many characters in this one, the main focus is on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic side exists, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this movie worth watching. At first, I liked how it resembled the Countess (from Zou Warriors) and played a good role in the Enigma game because it deals with her past life. Oh, by the way, have you mentioned that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedies and their special effects were limited because of its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes you to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
