Who would think Andy Griffith "Helen Crump" (Anita Korsot) has Steve McCain's film in the past? But this is just one of the many exotic and brilliant things about the film Battle Creatures of Teens in the 1950s, which can be described as the best movie "Rebels Without Reason", which meets with "God knows what outer space" is. The rebellious is Stephen McQueen (who soon decided that "Steve" looked less obvious), a good boy with enough wild to be interesting; very healthy companion after understanding is Anita Corso mentioned above. It was a very bad thing when their history was interrupted by hot teen beavers, but they do not feel much upset when they face what gelatin that man eats on earth on his hotrod meteor - and begins to cling to the townspeople right and left . But do adults believe them? Of course not, what do they know, they are just children! <br /> <br /> The movie is too small at its best. The actors take the fairly serious text seriously, with many looking affectionately at each other, and perhaps the "adult" support team says "Kids!" Very third sentence or so. But the real fun of the film is its creature, which it imagines well, is well executed, and often manages to generate an amazing degree of suspense. Although it's obvious on the cheap side (check out these mini-groups, young people!), The BLOB movie is actually a good movie design - and there's that attractive little song that was well put out. The crowd of more than 40 people (including myself) will enjoy the movie as nostalgic, but this will not stop them from eavesdropping on the younger group in its 50s of full-fat milk and eggs. A great choice to spend a night in family movies or just the most complex "adults only" meeting. Make lots of jello cubes for movie snacks! Gary Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon commentators
