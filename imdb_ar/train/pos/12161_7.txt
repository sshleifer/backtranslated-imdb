From the author of "What Happened to Baby Jane?" And "Silence .. Silence, Sweet Charlotte", this horror game at the end of the sixties horror cycle has some fun and weirdness. Micheál Macliammóir is a bit of Victor Buono, but the film often turns out to be very dangerous to bad music ... There's a bad story for the children in the middle of the road. Deby is engaged in hooking, tango and tricks in Harlow, while the religious Winters fanatic has a lesbian edge. Agnes Morehead is achieved as a missionary. Weaver has nothing to do - he has to pay a dance icon with Debbie.
