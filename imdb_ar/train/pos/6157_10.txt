This is a film I never thought of until I saw it until my 3-year-old daughter spotted it in the video store and grabbed it after I was impressed with the animal cover image on the island of Nabobo. We got it and watched it over and over again; in fact we've rented it several times since then. There are very few non-animated films that my son will see and notice; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. Great acting, attractive songs, deep into your head and you can only sing. The story, while WW2 specifically, is timeless in its own way, and there is something new that can be seen every time you see it. I've heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son does not care about Mary Bubbins. This is one of those films that children will want to watch over and over again and films that parents do not want to stick to. There are days we see before nap time and sleep time and I do not feel the harm will come when he wants to repeat any other film.
