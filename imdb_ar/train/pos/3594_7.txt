Michelle Rodriguez made this film when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could say she was a tough woman. With this film, she has not only demonstrated her representation, but has shown no fear and is as difficult as it should be in this film. She is a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This film revolves around a troubled girl who lives as a Tom boy and has a problem with school and family. While she is interested in training her brothers to be an angel, she decides to pursue her love for fighting and asks her trained brethren to train her. Although they do not believe that they have the potential, they only showed a mistake. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end, but it was good. It shows that people can do anything even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend him to be seen.
