This show contains a few clich√©s and a few of the top, Dawson-like creek moments (a 16-year-old talking about return when life is logical?), But generally looks like a decent show. Most of the characters seem to be very real, and the story seems to go well in the trial version - finished with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that each episode will not turn into a life change like the first, and it will be just too much drama for this car. Jeremy Sompeter is doing an excellent job when he was a baseball-hungry teenager, and I think many of us might call him a lunatic and sometimes see the tunnel for the team he always wanted to be part of.
