Freebird is the perfect marriage of comedy trip on the road, caper gang, film "stoner" and great British film. <br /> <br /> They are the leading characters who distinguish this film from other films of this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stritsch and Jeff Bell have wonderful chemistry and make their characters very popular and realistic. The main story revolves around their journey from London to Wales, adventures and accidents along the way. This little movie also has a big heart - not just for cycling fans, because it is based on personal relationships with each other including dreams and regret, such as the longing for Gary Stretch for the family he left behind. The cinema is also wonderful - a love letter to the Welsh countryside as well as capturing the courage of the streets of London and the life of the typical pub in Welsh rural towns. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, elegant, wonderful, funny, funny characters and funny story - I would recommend Freebird's heartbeat!
