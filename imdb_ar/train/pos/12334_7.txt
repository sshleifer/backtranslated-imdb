Does anyone know where this film was filmed? The scenery of flying on the cliff is beautiful. It looks like England. However, the apartment building in Ivy certainly resembles the Brill building, with its magnificent elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl has been listed as playing Sir Charles Gage. I may have rumbled, but I have never seen him. He may have been a lawyer for the husband, but, again, I do not remember that this character exists in the film, other than to mention that I made a phone call. Maybe it was in the aviation scene? Or hall scene? Has anyone seen him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he filmed this film.
