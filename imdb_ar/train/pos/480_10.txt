The main aspect of this film that most people miss is that Lohzin lives his life as a chess game. Many people have seen this film and have not got it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip. I will try to explain this without any saboteurs, but with prior warning, I am talking about the things that are happening in the film. <br /> <br /> **** Potential spoilers **** Be in advance! **** <br /> <br /> His life is "big movements" versus "small movements". Natalia chose to be his queen, and she acted as his aunt described for the first time the king and queen and their movements when they presented him with chess as a boy. Listen closely to this description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks a question, he goes back to the past as if he were reviewing previous moves. (The taillights are beautifully lit, by the way). The memories of the past are also interesting, because they present not only his view as a child, but also the view of the other person. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Various characters become either his aides or enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlighten you as to who stands beside them. Even putting them in a scene is central to understanding what is going on. It was beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens to Luhzin's character, but I hope that this lights up what really happens in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is constantly working on many levels, which is why I support it. I have had fun and pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I recommend a film called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is to use chess and characters that are dealt with as pieces. <br /> <br />
