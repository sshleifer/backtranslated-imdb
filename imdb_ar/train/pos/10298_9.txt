I was happy to see Jim Carrey in a movie where the goal was not the top. His character is like all of us. The desire for more - the better things happen to us and the expectation that God will accomplish. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman has created a great god. With a sense of humor and a real sense of love for each of us so far ready to spend a small holiday when offering the same opportunity. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was very weak and an understanding of Carrie. I want to be the anchor of the essentially self-centered TV, but that's how he wrote it. <br /> <br /> I think the previews destroyed many scenes that may be very funny because everyone who saw it knew what would happen before it happened. <br /> <br /> I've read a number of reviews, and some people seem to be looking a little bit deeper. This is a summer comedy and does not aim to solve the world's problems, although there are some messages that we can all take into account. A funny movie.
