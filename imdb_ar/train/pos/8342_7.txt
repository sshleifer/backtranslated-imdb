Pretty good romantic comedy I do not think I ever saw her looking for anything. All the players have done a good job in maintaining this vital game. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician will look at some greasy monkey, but that is why I love romantic comedy .... One can actually forget reality and spend a good time. Beautiful movie fuck, Meg is a babe, eh?
