This movie has ups and downs, but for me the goodies in this film far outweigh the bad guys ... <br /> <br /> What's not good in the film is sometimes the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting was (am I the only person Who observed how the groups lit up are amateurs, acting .... <br /> <br /> What is very good is the story of the very original story, the atmosphere is very intense, and the factor factor is too high, and the effects are greatly made. < br /> <br /> So, it's definitely worth seeing, or maybe you should see it for all you love fans of horror and stupidity ....
