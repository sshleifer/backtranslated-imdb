I remember admiring this more than Nosika in the Wind Valley in an age when the tone of the story was very serious to me. LaBotta, whose title seems to have influenced her release in the United States to avoid distracting her wide-ranging Hispanic audience, is characterized by a caricature of Conan's first appearance. In fact, Bazo enjoyed the timeless and immortal bones of Conan - who jumped from a thousand story carrying his girl in his arms and fell to his feet, and then began running. This makes him the most fun and happy person to watch. Nausica technicians may be disappointed by the emergency errors and old technology across Labota - the only exception may be Android. Unlike Princess Mononoke and the Valley of the Wind, the idea in Labota is not directly related to the environment. If he has a subject at all he is against the war. The importance of living normally - this is related to the flying castle, briefly discussed after a short period, and is not actually followed up. Overall, I now consider the piece at the crossroads between feeling complacent.
