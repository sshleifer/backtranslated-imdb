Since then I can remember that I am only 18 years old, and I was still watching the old movies because I find them more rewarding in the long term (but do not get me wrong, I like the movies we show today not as much as I liked the 1940s and the 1940s) Now, I have to say the moment I started watching the film, my eyes were fixed on television. Of course my favorite character was the grandma played by Lucille Watson. But I loved the way in which Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... did not act like children in the slightest thing. But there is a good reason for that. I had to hide most of your life and run it, and seeing the terrible things children saw in those days ruined their innocence. So people who say "oooo I hated how children behave ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know that they saw things that children should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas ... Dear Paul did an amazing job job !!! Now I know that many people are crazy because they went to Oscar and Boogie did not, but both did a great job, so I think it could have gone both ways. But the performance of Lukas was so amazing that at the end of the film it turned into tears. I loved this movie a lot and recommend it to anyone !! :-Dr
