This is the best view of what I think Jesus really was. Most films show that Jesus is bisexual, molded, or tortured. This Jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. This is the kind of Jesus that people can attract to, not the usual Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The movie took some liberties, trying to "fill in the blanks." But padding does not seem impossible, or even impossible. One thing I can say is that he did not explain what the Romans had against Jesus (the film shows that the Romans were the main engine of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have been well researched. An example of this is the uncommon comment of a teenage boy who was called a "sign". The sign (or sign John) is believed to be the boy referred to in the Garden of Gethsemane whose cloak was pulled and escaped naked (Mark 14:51). I felt that they tried to make the movie accurate (even in a spirit) possible.
