I first saw this as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitler Luftwaffe were quite clear and the scene of the film reminded us of our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing them. The strange thing is that he really did not date if he was seen as part of social history in cinematic fiction. <br /> <br /> Apart from the world's devastating war, the size of the machines has been greatly shaken, and it is now the most nano technology, but in general, excellent work and good preparation. It was interesting to see how the travel to space was perceived at that time. I think launching a spacecraft from a giant gun will definitely kill astronauts. However, much was right. Man's desire for war, man's inhumanity to man. Means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
