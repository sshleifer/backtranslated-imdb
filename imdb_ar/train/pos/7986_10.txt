It is a wonderful and terrifying film. It is by far the best I have seen portraying the current reality in Latin America ... kidnappings, corruption, greedy police officers, greed and cruel chaos towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most exciting performance in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is a stunning young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is fascinating, written and visualized every minute. Fantastic cast, Christopher Walkin, Mickey Rourke is as wonderful as always. Walken illuminates the screen for me like any other actor. I loved to see more of them. Authentic authentic sites. The work of the camera is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors on the team, making it more interesting for people who know Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this film.
