An old life story recounted by two young girls by their grandfather appears 16 years later predicting. Being enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bushett) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfati)? Did Evelyn die from retribution? Is it a conspiracy to steal inheritance? The color was wonderful in this exciting film by Emilio Migraglia, who did only the other Giallo, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined the movie was the appearance of several frames. Someone called the police and suddenly they were trying to save Kitty.
