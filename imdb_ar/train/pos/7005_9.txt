When the DVD was released I came to the market and bought it. I think my money was in the right way as I expected before buying it. Fantastic film What can I say to Will Smith, I've been a great actor as always in both sexy and serious films. It always gives a standard braking performance. I think this is the film after August Rush that makes a person cry while watching it. The way the filmmaker described the story was truly fascinating. His previous life and his new life in the film were properly put to the public. I did not find any fault in the story or the way they fired. I think his DVD should be home because that would be really great for your group. It's not the movie that needs a pop-up to enjoy it, it's the movie that lets the audience learn the lesson. Now what lesson you can see while watching. I would recommend these people who criticize films, please watch this if you may find any criticism of this movie then please talk to me.
