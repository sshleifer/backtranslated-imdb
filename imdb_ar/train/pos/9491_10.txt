Henry Vernwell's film may not be as popular as the Parallax View or 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is certainly not worse and sometimes better than these classic actors of this genre. The work takes place in a fictional Western state where a fictional president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides to kill the president by a single gunman. But one man - Attorney General Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is something else to investigate, and so the film begins. This film does not deal with some fine theories, but it embraces the full structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film can only be made in the 1970s, but it will never be lost. Moreover, it is a bit scary how accurate Oracle is. 10 out of 10.
