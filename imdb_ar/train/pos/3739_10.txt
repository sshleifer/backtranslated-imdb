I really love this movie. Booz is a very wonderful soldier who does not fear and does not want to go to war. His character is similar to the Yossarian style in Cach 22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, was not assigned to a war zone, but in preparatory training before the war. This wonderful film revolves around the apprehension that the Vietnam War was a mistake and that these men were linked to sacrifice for a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is as wonderful as Booz, a soldier who showed much true love and compassion to his fellow soldiers as he did disdain and resentment for the institution that was trying to kill him. Booz is absolutely wonderful and uncomfortable, testing and changing his military superiors and getting a goat at every opportunity. It is the personality of Jesus Christ who has a degree in psychology, "saves" his fellow soldiers and shows who they really need, and out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> Acting and acting crisp as a "Sleeper," Tigerland migrates with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three Vietnamese films in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Five stars, best choice.
