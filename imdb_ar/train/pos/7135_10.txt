This film should be one of the most exciting and exciting films. It is good family entertainment while at the same time making you think carefully about the issues involved. Every time I see "Zach's ghost riding the bike through the ponds in the end, I can not help but shout from my eyes." John Tao's performance is very moving and it's a shame he's not with us anymore.
