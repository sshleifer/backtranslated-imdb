This reunion, team, and a wonderful ring of justice. From hesitation to solution, Clark made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of the potted pot, to Superman who, like Green Arrow, set aside his passions for his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. This also relates to determining what is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that the ensuing episodes will be strictly adhered to by the justice program without any "retrograde" payments and a good ending here for Smallville --- and a wonderful start to Superman. <br /> <br /> However, in this episode, we should have seen a greater contrast between Lex and the team. Nine stars must give them enough credit.
