The movie begins with a group of dead men walking in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable encounter with the death represented by the electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then "Our Hero", named Tenshu, is moved to a chair, he zap, and then ... still "alive". AHA! He is chosen by some terrifying military men who look great: either slip you down to make sure you're dead or you can walk through that door and take whatever fate you have. "Our hero says yes to option 2, then the actual story begins. /> <br /> He wakes up in a different kind of cell (a very high and very high technique), where he finds another cellmate who managed to survive the electric dance, where the sound in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they like, The room looks a bit suspicious, but the two men accept: What these two men do not know is that they were combined with So that they can awaken a domestic desire to kill within them, so that they decide that they should kill each other.It seems strange, in fact, but there is a greater purpose for all of this, that is the undisclosed part, so it must remain undetected. <br /> <br /> But do not be afraid, it is not surprising that the viewer is tempted to see more of this false film. The starting point is a completely different approach to the question: How long can you stand with a man who has SOB and will you kill him for freedom? <br /> The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks without actually knowing it. After that, become a tour of the roller coaster with WILD Matrix scenes that resemble fighting films with a touch of exclusivity to honor the comic book on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> The movie is very special indeed, especially since ordinary cinemas will not be seen in normal circumstances. However, the story is wonderful, the music is fantastic, the actors you turn (some of them more than others) to make the film really unique. <br /> <br /> If you are so lucky that your movie or video store it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that everyone is not trying to produce mainstream movies to earn huge collections of money. <br /> <br />
