To be half Portuguese does not make me blind (or unbiased) when discussing Portuguese films. I can not do this often anyway. But this movie was like a rush of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was mostly as accurate as history has gone - but it has not caught any adventurer in entering beyond the usual Portuguese cinema: things like using real sites in the bustling center of Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in the real crowd for nearly From 30 years. And God did it correctly! Well, to sum it up: very emotional if you've gone through it, but you'll discover the minor improvements that could have been made as well as the necessary plots. If you watch it randomly, you are in a good historic elite, and only a very modern log type, more exciting than usual time. Even by European standards, yes.
