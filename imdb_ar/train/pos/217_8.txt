SUNSHINE BOYS was a funny adaptation of the 1975 screenplay with the Neil Simon play about a retired voice team, played by Walter Matau and George Burns, who were subjected to a very bitter break and asked them to reunite again for a private television stage or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and do not want to do anything with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as one of my brothers Mattao, a theater actor who has been entrusted with his enormous responsibility to make this reunion a reality. This warm and luxurious comedy is a beautiful Valentine's Day for a forgotten form of entertainment ... Vodafone works mainly thanks to one of the best Neil Simon scenarios and outstanding work by Matao, Burns, and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that, but I think Mattao walks with this film through his flawless and flawless performance like Willie Clarke. Matthau was nominated for best actor, but he did not face a chance against Nicholson about ONE FLEW over CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in another year, this performance was worth the Oscars. Matthau orders the screen and there is no wrong note in this beautiful timing performance. The scene is a test of the potato chip and can not really get the name of the product. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is Neil Simon's warm and winning comedian who shines with the unmatched chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
