I would just say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera examined his body after everything was clean, it was beautiful on his first trip to my generation, I was in a state of terror. Debra Winger offers, as always, an ideal performance like a naive and young Bud wife, but with the attitude necessary to be married to stubborn cowboys and hardworking. If you are not a country music person, which is not what you are, this one soundtrack will make you sing well with every word. If you get a chance, please watch this movie, I will not be disappointed.
