Parker (Jonathan Shake) aspiring writer is still looking for a great break. In the meantime, he works as a phone consultant for a hotline in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his apartment building burns. Barker and his cat have emerged but are now busy with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in Big Apple. A word comes to Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate but will only accept a gay male. Since Barker was straight but the price was right, he decided to pretend he was an anomaly. Samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as a new co-ordinator. But poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Besides, does not Sam have a successful business friend anyway? It is a beautiful, lovable and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaik. Of course, this plot is a series of "How can I keep this trick", where Sam asks Parker to shampoo while bathing or cling to him to put her in bed when she receives bad news. Also, it is necessary that Parker produce his "fake" homosexual partner, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing it with a man you know. We hope that this gay community will not find this very offensive, because this scene believed that most of the problems were dealt with sensitively and accurately. For a small film, the costumes, collections and camera work were also very nice. So, if you like these funny stories of love, get this story soon. You will love what you see, I know it.
