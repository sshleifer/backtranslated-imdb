Since almost all critics are the best in the films of Johnny and Yosmuler Tarzan, I have no argument with that, although there are two other couples I thought were fun. One thing: It's the longest in the series I've seen in 105 minutes. I saw only six of them, but this was longer than I used to, and with the end of the long movement I thought it was all too long. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good combination of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are sound and stereo sound. The primitive special effects do not bother me, because that was all they came back to in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this movie is most famous for one thing: skin! "Jane" never wore anything after this film, where the Hayes Blog was created by the time of the production of the next Tarzan film. Her uniform showed her what a great personality Morin O'Sullivan had. Underwater scene naked, however, did not have - by long. The underwater woman did not have a good personality at all, whatever it was. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of actions here. Until the end, it was not exaggerated, too. The end lasted for 15 minutes, although it was so intense that there was much to see. <br /> <br /> However, this movie offers everything - except for "Boy" - you want to see in the Tarzan movie, so O'Sullivan does her Tarzan yell about ten times. With her husband from the "lungs", it was not a problem.
