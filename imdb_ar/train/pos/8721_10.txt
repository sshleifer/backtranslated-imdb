Disney (and the wonderful people at PIXAR of course) offer a fun and funny story with the best computer animations. I admit that the "faces" of the bugs were probably a little sturdier than "Antz" and they had only four legs (in "Antz" six ...). But fantastic wallpapers and animation were breathtaking. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer that succeeded in achieving this success: it was the person behind the machine that added the nice little twists I missed in Antz. Some of the highlights were, of course, the "bluffers" at the end (so keep watching in the end, it's worth it!), Which was very fun and imaginative. The "Fully photographed on site" line is designed for the most interested viewers.
