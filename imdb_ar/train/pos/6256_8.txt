I may be here, but even though the film itself was a masterpiece of his time, I saw him piece by piece on TCM last night, the question that comes to me: Why did they do that? Their lives are in danger, many of them have died on the journey, why are they making a life-threatening trip, just to find food for their animals (!) Once they reach the "land of milk and honey", why did not they? Do they stay there? Do you endanger your life and the life of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? Equally dangerous, to do so for this purpose alone, shows the inherent simplicity of these types of people. Danger of death for a cow ?? Best of them than you!
