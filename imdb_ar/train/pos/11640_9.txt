The best thing about this movie is that like Hitchcock movies, it's an exciting movie that does not take itself seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understands that people go to the cinema to spend their time. Something Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is an exciting film, but it contains a lot of laughter and has one eye jutting the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams are as wonderful as they always are. Ciran Murphy is creepy than it was in Batman begins. In the old days, there were men who always play bad guy. We do not see many of these days because I think that Hollywood customers consider it a bad career, but Celian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The steering is surprisingly neat. The story is good but the dialog box could have used some suggestions. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really fun movie and people applauded when the final credits began to appear. If you're in the mood for a fun comic, the "red eye" may be your ticket.
