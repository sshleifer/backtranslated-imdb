It was supposed to be the silent film "Pride of the Clan" starring Mary Pickford on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the external footage was filmed at Marblehead Marblehead on Marblehead near many coastal rocky coastal areas including Chorn and Rock Castle. My first interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of Marblehead in my hometown, and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was appointed as a supporter of Mary Beckford while filming several scenes including "The Scenery of the Abyss". Both women were small (5 inches) in position, and both my parents and grandmother told me that she was standing in her back to the camera to watch the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton collection. I just wanted to tell this story to film historians and future amateurs. The film itself (a fairly bad DVD version) was done very well with a lot of action and expressive representation including many scenes where Miss Pickford depicts a strong personality for women. I enjoyed it and wanted to get a better version of it although I'm not sure if it exists as I have seen in various film sites that the remaining copies are dark due to degradation. Very beautiful movie of the silent kind with a lot of work!
