Paul Reiser is one of my favorites in the field of show business. I've read all of his books and I think it's great. Peter Faulk can offer a punch line with their best. The combination of the two is magic. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really knows each other. Through a journey on the road, the father and son communicate for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all the things that parents and children are supposed to do in life ... they do it only later in life. The positions are very funny, but they have a feeling that they can actually happen to people in real life (not closely on top or caricature). This is the first time I have seen Paul Reizer and I believe all the feelings that were filmed. Sometimes, his eyes look very sad. <br /> <br /> Gret is a wonderful story and plot. She has a comedy and passion but an upscale message ... Olympia Dukas does a great job too :)
