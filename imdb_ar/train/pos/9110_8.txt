you know? Our spirit is built on that revolution, it's asleep ... I can explain, I think! Well ... until it happened on 25 April 1974, our freedom was limited, and we did not have freedom of expression, but when we reached the revolution, the Portuguese people seemed to have lost their minds, and we did not use freedom of speech! This is all a result of the revolution! I think this is obvious! ... about the film ... I think it contains some mistakes in representing someone, but by the way, I'm good to watch Portuguese movies. I love it so much!
