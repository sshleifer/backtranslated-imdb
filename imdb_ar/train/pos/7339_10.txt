Since I heard about the Ralph Beckshi version of the "Lord of the Rings" I wondered: What the hell is the "telescope" of animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I've watched this movie for almost three years and I have no idea who Ralph Beckshi is ... I loved ... very much ... a very good story line ... even with a small personality development It's great for a cartoonist ... Watch him if you're bored by contemporary animation .... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a pretty cartoon ... it's a very good movie ...
