"Adult oriented film" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does a good job, and still better than a normal, well-aged film. Although comedic moments are meant to be less than the rest of his moments, the film has a special peculiarity (Italians in Brooklyn) not used to shorten characters or viewers. (That is, mobs never appear in complexity, never become as strange as my big wedding in Greece). Economic story stories are listed in short scenes that allow you to get out of the main thread. These are scenes that are now lacking in contemporary films where their direct value can not be convinced by producers and eminent persons. I miss these scenes as it beautifully involves old characters. The film takes its quiet, quiet way to its end. There is no poorly written scene that is included anywhere to make some sphincter executives relax. Cage and Cher do a very nice job. <br /> <br /> Monstock cites the old, ethnic and practical school in New York as "Marty" but Monstock is less appreciative.
