German TV is famous for its Dutch version and ?? Naturally ?? US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, Xeroxing went just beyond the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> Can not you stand on the spiral comedy? You do not see Edel and Starck. seriously. If you expect another drama from the lawyers like law and order or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or Watch Law & Order as it is very cool in what he does, but I digress.) E & S is funny, often tackles the subjects of thought, which is funny, romantic, funny, funny, also intelligent. <br /> Frankly, I am very scared that the book did not get better deals after the final of the series. My sarcastic nature needs to be reset: German private television productions. The people of Germany will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: see it. I do not have the coolest English synchronicity, but hey, it's good to learn German only to watch the four seasons. Happy end included pseudo.
