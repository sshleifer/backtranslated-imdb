A young woman is a successful model, and is also involved in marriage, which she tried to commit suicide twice in the past, by a secret society and far from Catholic priests to be the next "guard" to the Gate of Hell, which appears through the old Brooklyn apartment building, but in good condition. Tenants rent the stairs upstairs and can re-raise themselves, but they obviously can not escape as long as the guard is there to block the road. The former (John Carradine) revolves around the dead, becoming, by fate or whatever, the other, and the condemned must make them kill themselves to be free. There are many interesting details under the surface, her relationship with her father, the stories of her self, and her fianc√©, so that one can tell this horror of cheap exploitation, but given the groups, the great crew, and the overall level of strangeness, this is definitely worth seeing.
