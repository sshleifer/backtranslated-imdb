Artemisia Gentilisi, the daughter of Orazio Gentilesi, showed an early promise as a painter. Artemisia was born by her father in an era that deprived talented women of their right to see their works side by side. Her tragic life in this film was chronicled by his autobiography, co-authored by Agnes Merleck. <br /> <br /> After reading Artemisia's novel "Passion for Artemisia" by Susan Freeland, she made us look more into this woman's life, work and heritage. We also read the book "Artemisia Gentileschi", which must be a book to be read by all art lovers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" shows the fictional facts we read about showing the early life of a young woman as she begins to paint. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, Caravaggio, Tusi Agostino, and other Florence painters of that period. Her relationship and love relationship with Tassie is the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately can not go as far as it can be because of prejudice against women in the arts. This did not help because she caused a scandal where she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to go to Rome to distance herself from that unhappy time in her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Serve makes beautiful Artemisia. It is a wonderful creature awakened passion in men. Michelle Serraol plays the role of Orazio. Mickey Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in prison. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a brilliant look captured by Benoit Delhomme camera with a great camera. The scenic places of the film give an idea of ​​what inspired the school to paint in its paintings. The music by Krishna Levy serves well what we see. Agnes Merleck certainly produced a visual style for her.
