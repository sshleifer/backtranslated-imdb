This film moves without being emotional - meaningful without being a ton. It tells a simple story of a family at risk of collapse because the encroachment on technology and the evolving society makes family-run businesses increasingly untenable. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful - although none of us are in the West likely to have heard about these actors, and should have long been - playing their characters honestly and reverently - these characters are flawed, each of them Great weaknesses, but with such a gentle and gentle humanity that it is impossible not to share the story. <br /> <br /> We need more movies like this - we need more Western filmmakers who make such films.
