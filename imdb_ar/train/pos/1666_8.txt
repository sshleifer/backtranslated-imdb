This is a film about seventeenth-century Italian artists and an artist in particular, a woman of Artemisia, unheard of by a female profession at the time, and daring to paint a naked portrait of a man detailing his unique muscles. The work of the camera is basically where artists worked mainly. There are some wonderful shots. The close-ups of candlelight indicate the beautiful work of classical painters, and it is wonderful to see the painters and their students supported by the fine scaffolding brush in the details of the religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (fashion, faces, make-up) are wonderfully authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in the frescoes for centuries. Artemisia Fine was urged by her father to study under the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who became an expert in the art of perspective painting and landscape (something very new) but unsuspecting artemisia is more of modern techniques in drawing. After pretending to her, Tasi raped her violently. Her father is angry. Follow the court proceedings. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is the technical presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women running in a field with the wind seeping out their huge clothes have great effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she draws to please herself; paints her father to please others. As for this movie, you'll satisfy more, I think.
