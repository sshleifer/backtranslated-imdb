Well - as far as the two versions of this film. There were two people involved in making the film - John Corti and Bill Couture (George was the only producer - he really did not have any opinion in the film - just helped the money) - the "adult" version became Bill Couture. John Korty did not like or approved this version (as was behind his back). Thanks to the current Ladd movies, they did not announce this movie and threw all their advertising money for "The Right Stuff", hoping to bring it; ... and did not. So, this film did not have a real chance. When "Twice" came to the cable (HBO) - they showed rollers with Bill and John threatened to sue if it was shown anymore (have you noticed how the "adult" version has not been run for too long?). Showtime got the "clean" version. The version on the video and laser is the version adopted by John (who holds more power than Bell). It's really unfortunate, because the "adults" version is actually better and meaningless. But it is doubtful that it will be released in this version on DVD (or any other format less than bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information, as I used to be president of Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (I still have many elements of the movie - used to have a copy stuffed with characters from the "Adult" version, but you just stole a partial HBO version now). 8 stars to the "adults" version - 5 to the "clean" version. Any other question? just ask.
