It's hard to see this film in our 21st century culture, but it's worth it for the messages it conveys, especially the consequences of technology and its implications for society, especially when it is used in warfare. <br /> <br /> This film presents a whole circle of inhumanity and re-humanity as it is influenced by the emergence of technology and the subsequent dismantling of civilization, and thus serves as a warning story against the misuse of technology, but with the completion of the circle itself, Self-service methods rather than self-destruct methods that humanity may use for technology. <br /> <br /> Fantastic for the time has come, image and sound quality may be challenging for some, but as a historical landmark in the history, development and development of this kind of science, it is a must. In the end, free will and free choice of humanity are once again presented as a means of controlling our destiny rather than being presented to us by another person or indeed, the state of society, as well as the events of the world. <br /> <br /> Those who are persecuted by the way they live sometimes tend to stay the same, but there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity, as this film shows. As much as it is qualified as a science fiction, one of the most common speculators of this species is speculative nature. Asks us questions, what if these events occurred in this way, and what impact on the community or individuals within it? How will we react? <br /> <br /> As far as the impact, this film presents those speculative sciences that make science fiction unique and keep us asking these important questions.
