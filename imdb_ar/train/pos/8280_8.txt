George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in New York State when their car collides with deer and turns into a pit. But what seems like a misfortune is the beginning of a terrifying journey, where the legend becomes a reality and a spirit of flesh-eating, half a half-man and a man, Wendigo, chasing a small town ... "Wendigo" Larry Vesendeen is a thrilling horror film that often turns into a family drama. The characters have been developed well and there are some chilling moments. Wendigo's delicate profiles are handled effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story is entirely revolving in Miles head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden and certainly will not be the last. Give this movie a chance, if you do not mind watching something funky.
