Daniel Day Lewis is Christie Brown, the victim of cerebral palsy that uses "my left foot" for writing and painting in this wonderful film in 1989. The film also starred Brenda Frecker as Emma Christie, Ray McNally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Connor. Their great performance, great book and excellent guidance for Jim Sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of Christie Brown, an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born in a lower-class Catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of whom survived). His father Christie was mentally retarded and physically handicapped, but his son was not allowed to go home. The children in the family deposited him every day when they went to school, and then his mother fed him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Fricker conveys the feeling of a woman who, despite being surrounded by a huge family, needs someone to talk to. Christie does not speak again. In the end, he found a wagon he was riding, and the neighborhood children, who had known him all since he was young, included him in all their activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when the children discover the extent of his kick, they put him in football games for that purpose only. One of the most beautiful parts of the film is the comfortable way other children treat it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but there is no power like Christie's writing "Mother" on the ground carrying a piece of chalk between his toes. His father declares, "He is a real son," and raised him on his shoulders and took him to the bar. As he walks to the bar, he says: "My son is a genius." Things change when Christie grows up because he has the wishes and feelings of a little boy. Develops and grinds and refuses and goes to himself and turns to painting. In the end, he receives treatment at a nearby clinic and works with Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When he discovers that she is engaged, he is almost insane. But he survives to live, draw, write (three books in total) and love her again. <br /> <br /> Because it's a movie, you must necessarily exclude some things and combine characters. Brown was not already suffering from cerebral palsy for some time, which was excluded from the film. The therapist Elaine is actually a combination of three important therapeutic personalities in Christie's life, and although we know that his mother thinks he had a good mind, in fact, she worked hard with Christie when he was a child teaching him the alphabet, etc. Well, before Mary, Christie had a 12-year relationship with a woman who devoted her "left foot". The usual end of Hollywood, 9 years before his death, where his wife's neglect was a factor, does not end with the story. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, Christie Brown's biography is incredibly strong, all more so because of two performances: Hugh O'Connor as Christie's young man and Daniel Day Lewis like Christie the Elder. O'Connor's expression of the face and the way he pulls his mutilated body is disturbing. One is exhausted for him and broken at the same time. <br /> <br /> What can be said about Daniel Day Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - he brings Christie to life completely and has a full body outside, intelligent person capable of swearing, anger, bitter, drunk, opportunistic , Punk, funny and love. Oscar won well in the same year Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on July 4th." I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that was a very exciting cruise. What's wrong with the academy? Uh, nothing to change. nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing like Christie's mother, who never stops believing in him and what he can do that connects her family and her husband in difficult times. The great thing about Fricker's performance is that the ethics of support, love and work seem to come naturally to the mother. The character will never be considered a heroine or as someone who does something unusual. Freiker shows us a religious, not a fanatical woman who believes that her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother. Regardless, even when her husband is unemployed, their daughter is expelled from the house because she is pregnant, whatever she is, she runs. She saves money for Christie's chair, receives pictures of her daughter and child, and begins to build a room for Christie at the back of the house. Every part of the work for one day. The show deserves the Oscars I got. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complex than this inspiring film, but it's a great achievement for everyone involved and you have to watch it.
