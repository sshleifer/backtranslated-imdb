This was a good story ... it had a good pace, so all the characters were superbly developed. <br /> <br /> I've seen a whole series of movies in the past two weeks and this was the best I've seen in the past two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Beige's character was the best, <br /> <br /> Although it was small, it was cleverly designed from the start. <br /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like it any more, but the writing, direction, performance, sound and overall design of all the capabilities were truly fantastic. <br /> <br /> This movie has hit the highest level of all the movies I've seen recently - and the rest was a big budget or better published. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
