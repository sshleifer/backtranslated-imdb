This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never expect anyone else to "get it" but I'm delighted when I recommend it and enjoy it. My father was the late Hatur Arthur Asky, but this film was really enjoyed by him and his constant enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" was transferred to me as a child. Years later, I see him from time to time, and I enjoy the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be as it is but I have never been disappointed. There is so much to enjoy. The sequence on the train is really inspired when Ascii and Murdoch advance to annoy the arrogant male passenger. If the whole section of the station is amazing with lots of things you should keep going. Yes, she is dated and full of British wartime accents and plot (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of the fame of my father's army!) But full of great characters - including Kathleen Harrison as a yarn. The atmosphere is really the nearest villain as you can get a car of Arthur Asky. This is cheaply available in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. It is an ideal Saturday or Sunday or any piece of light entertainment on a lazy afternoon. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> Old movies can be good movies!
