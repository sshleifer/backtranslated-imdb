I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, because the only problems I face are because of the excessive exposure to the film's graphic devices - it seems that this kind of common stuff for each of the children's films has appeared. This does not make it bad, not just something I'll go away. <br /> <br /> It's a little drunk, so I can say that most of the time looking for someone who has something smarter. I was disappointed in the film obviously like children. <br /> <br /> However, it all comes out of the window when that squirrel (one in all trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems clear that policymakers have the wisdom to say to these guys, "Hey, can you stick to a little more squirrel?" Every time they become unbearably boring. Do not save this movie, but you can say "At least there was one side where I could not stop laughing." <br /> <br /> Of course, you will not be disappointed, but this is almost given with Pixar clicks. Of all they have, I put this down ... but that's not bad in itself.
