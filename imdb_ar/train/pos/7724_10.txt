Certainly Star Wars (a film I saw at least 50 times) beats all the others with special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horror (non-graphic) and romantic robots, Barty Barty, intelligence, special effects (surprisingly good), and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie two years ago in a revival with a recent print edition, and I was amazed at how well it performed today. I thought that old electronics in the 1940s would seem tense, but looked modern and modern. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is still here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a bold innocence that can not be overcome by my renaissance. <br /> <br /> The Krell monster still visible in the beam beams scares me bejebees. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that "Great of the Galaxy" may have designed a great model for "Star Trek" from this movie. <br /> <br /> No one has yet overcome Robbie, a robot, in terms of character <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, in general, is the standard that all other science fiction movies have to measure! <br /> <br /> We reminded the esteemed of the eerie electronic result that kept us all on nails and needles.
