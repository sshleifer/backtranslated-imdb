I'm surprised that a lot of viewers are more respectful for the sequel of this wonderful film ... I've seen all the Guinean pigs and this is the best easily. <br /> <br /> Although I saw "Made", I still have doubts when I watch this minute of 35 minutes of torture: it's strong. <br /> <br /> A film out of 10, because this film has achieved what it has done quite: to be the best film fake smell ever made.
