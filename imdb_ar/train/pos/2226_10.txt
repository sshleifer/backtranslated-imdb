I am amazed at the low IMDb rating for this movie. With all due respect, its low ranking represents the intelligence level of those who classify it as very poor. They prefer to watch a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more laughter. <br /> <br /> The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. It is not, and the film does not fool you into believing it is one. It's an exciting psychological story. It's for people who want intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reviewing Reel.com is an ideal example of how I feel about this film. All other negative reviews are meaningless. It seems like trying to make an original film for change - very rare these days - is bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal some spoilers for the blind who said it was boring and did not make sense. Martha was washing herself and experimenting with herself to be a parish mother while she was really a wicked Nazism who would be killed without warning. The evidence is all in the vortex and the fact that we are in the premiere, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster throughout the film is proof of the direction of the film and its writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should be rated at least in the G-6 on originality alone. I recommend this movie to people on the other end of the IQ scale - also known as smart people - because it is clear that this film is being slaughtered by those who prefer watching Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kodus to acting as well. For such a low-budget film, you are surprised that this film has not reached your local cinema in the great direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. I actually recommend buying a movie because seeing the first on rent will not bring this justice.
