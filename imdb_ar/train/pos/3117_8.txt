I will start by saying that I am very pleased with this peak of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please do not spoil by doing the sequel years from now or prequel. Just leave it alone. Okay. On the go. As a versatile and versatile client like Matt Damon ... it seems as though he was just supposed to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. Stick to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how all the information we get in "identity" and "excellence" fit into the "final warning" to paint the full picture of the troubled past of Jason Bourne. Fast-motion sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The battles between Born and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA is gathering with Intel, and this film is on the street, which makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne as a final warning without watching the previous two payments .. you will still enjoy the movie completely but I still recommend you watch it first. This would allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become linked and be part of his world. This allows you to rate your movie and enjoy it more. I'm not sure what's the best in the first 2 but I personally think that the "final warning" may be at the edge when comparing a trilogy.
