I am disappointed by the lack of participation in this surprisingly small and effective film. Jordi Mola, who is most likely to be known for his role in the film Diego in Blow's writings by Ted Demme and starring and starring. <br /> <br /> I would not abandon any plot points, such as the movie (at least for me)) was very exciting because he did not know anything about it .. If you have a netflix account, or you can access a video store I highly recommend it. It is an exciting establishment of madness, fun, and sometimes thought provoking. <br /> <br /> The direction of Moll√† is very impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with stunning images and wonderful performance in the beautiful Spanish language "No somos nadie" (God on Air) is a wonderful movie you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> See it.
