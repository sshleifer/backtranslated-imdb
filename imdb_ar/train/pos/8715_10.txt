This movie is the newest I've seen in a long time! The wonderful animations and the lovely characters (even the bad guys were nice!) Made this a complete winner in my book, and also in the books I saw in it. I still want to see him again, but I have not had time. Best of Toy Story, which was very good, but not good.
