It is a reworking of many modern films only, this film contains fewer stars, fewer complications and a vague feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Isha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their (unknown) marriage begins in the arrangement process. At any given time, the two strange people are married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet with other couples who deal with movements similar to their movements. While spending time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or flowers repaired. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, I've seen this movie. The transitions are the same, and there is one element of surprise in the two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I enjoyed it just because I saw Darling (also starring Diol and Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry. I said "why not" when my sister suggested that we hire a "married only" girl. <br /> <br /> Watch it: Because Kirron Kher shares with her stars and she's my usual darling. <br /> <br /> Skip it: because you've had enough of all this nonsense at the couple festival! <br /> <br /> C +
