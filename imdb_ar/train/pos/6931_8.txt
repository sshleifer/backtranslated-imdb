By 1955, five years after the release of this film, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed six other films together, four of them Western. Their connection was clear from the beginning and what was intended was more than just a global program that became cult and classic. Fans of this period will reveal the fact that the top ten names on the credits were all more known - and this does not count on Ray Tyll or Anthony Curtis, later becoming Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the "psychological" West was well established, but in 1950 it was rare for Ahab to mix with Cain and Abel, not to say anything about tackling many other issues along the way, and still present a traditional Westerner on the surface. And full credit to all concerned. One to add to a DVD set.
