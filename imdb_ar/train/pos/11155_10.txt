Joe Pack (John Voight), a handsome young man from Texas, moves to New York, believing he will live by being a mistress. He came there and quickly discovered that it would not be easy - he went through a humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope Ratsu Rizo binds paralyzed (Dustin Hoffman). They try to survive together and get out of town and move to Florida. But will you produce it? <br /> <br /> The film is too dark and disturbing but impressive. Director John Schlesinger paints a very bleak picture of New York City and its inhabitants. This way dated - the city was probably so bad in 1969 but it has been cleaned up so far. As every camera trick is used in the book - the color turns into black and white. Trippy dream sequence. A glimpse of the future; the appearance of the flash (especially rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you name it. It makes you feel confused and out of the center - but I could not stop watching. <br /> <br /> There is not much of the story - it focuses mainly on the friendship between Rizo and Buck. There are signs that they were probably lovers (the type of last shot shows it). It is just a picture of two affected people trying to survive in a cold, harsh, urban forest. <br /> <br /> X was originally compiled in 1969 - the only reason is that the MPAA did not think that parents wanted their children to see this. However, it was a big blow with high school students (at that time X meant one under 17). It was also the only X movie to receive an Oscar for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voet were in the list of awards as they were (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for 5 minutes (maybe)! It was eventually reduced to R (with no cuts) when it was re-released in 1980. <br /> <br /> The excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" was also featured in this movie - and became a great success. Fantastic movie --- but very dark. I give it 10. I do not see it on commercial television - it's cut into ribbons and incomprehensible.
