An absolute masterpiece of a movie! Mr.Tom's fast becoming one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should miss seeing this movie, it's very good! John Tao photographed Mr. Tom completely as the tough old man who became a soft father when William Beach (Nick Robinson) was sent to him for evacuation, like "town mouse and rural mouse." Heart film is really a wrench. The director knew exactly how to turn the book into a film and did a very good job. The film is so well portrayed that the emotions of characters and what happens make the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear, and these feelings can turn into six pennies. This film, which was set during the turbulence of World War II, shows the difference between cities and countryside. It resembles almost different countries. Must see the absolute, those who never miss a really wonderful and wonderful film.
