I started watching this TV show back on a Sunday afternoon, and I think it was just a flick of another airplane disaster. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Pandora's Clock is a smart political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most television movies. It was equally possible to appear for the first time on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herman, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga becomes one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, Frazier and Jane Levis are also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is compelling. In fact, the last hour is full of intrigues and suspense so you can not leave your seat for a second. If you get a chance to watch this movie, invest time - nearly four hours. Rich will be rewarded!
