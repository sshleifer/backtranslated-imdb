My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more and no less. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and quiet. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets and connects with Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway. It seemed that everything was fine at the beginning of their relationship, but then Matt discovered that she was a GI girl. At first it seemed very cool for Matt, but it turned out that G-Girl was very jealous and needed. So he decided to break up with her and communicate with his colleague Hannah (Anna Fares). This makes G-Girl very crazy and begins to avenge her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I most like about the movie is the scenes in which G-Girl avenged herself on Matt. It was also good to see Anna Fares in another role and then her character from the Scary Movie epic. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes a nice comedy.
