Gundam Wing for me happens to be a good anime. The traffic is a bit slow (especially around the middle of the chain), but everyone is pleasant. Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "wing," I will admit that I have seen Gundam, Gundam 0080, 0083, the MS 08th and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there were some problems in telling the story and some characters may seem to be "ripped" (ie, Zechs Marquise to the original Char Gundam's Char), but this is an alternative universe based on the original series, SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to view this series, be sure to see the original Gundam first, then know that you are watching a series of AU.
