This was unbelievable, in the sense that it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year, and that the directors, Cooper and Chudzak, did not organize some scenes and stills. But what the shots are! Cinema, under often harsh conditions, is fascinating, and the result of Iranian music added to the video version of this unforgettable documentary gives added richness. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see this and "Kon Tiki" on the weekend itself, which was interesting and certainly made me see how strong, courageous and courageous people were, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or science.
