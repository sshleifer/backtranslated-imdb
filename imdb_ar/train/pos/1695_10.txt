Usually the best way to get annoyed in a movie is to include some references to Orson Welles. But you have a scientific comedy, quoting Radio World War .... It is gold! The very concept of a small handful of meager, aggressive and stupid foreigners being mistaken as the kids in Halloween clothes is gorgeous. Do not be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a film for children, it is not developed - it is not so, there is a lot of hidden treasure ... essence!
