This film has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed man who tries to steal from a small shop while the store clerk is caught in the act ... The thief escapes the store clerk immediately after him. All the time, the store clerk faces a problem with a small class of Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along the hunt for the thief, they have caught the attention of Yakuza who was looking for a store clerk. The story then moves to a high level in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but is added with the dog chasing after the cat. The entire Chapter II of D.A.N.G.A.N. The runner goes on to the point where, at the end of the second season, Boom forgets why he is running away, and Yakuza does not remember which of the players is chasing them, nor does he remember why they ran away from him . <br /> <br /> Like the subsequent SABU movie POSTMAN BLUES, the bulk of the film is simply chasing and moving, pumping a lot of physical comedy and dark humor to keep the audience engaged. What lies in the mansions is the end, when the chase ends when the three men run out, and in one of the most chaotic open encounters you'll see in a movie that looks like Sabo was praising Tony Scott's true romance (written by Quentin Tarantino).
