Some of these guys who watch the movies and complain about them for their living forget something: DVD menu system. I tell you people, I have seen the main screen repeated in this one about 35 times. It was awesome. A film of the cascading brilliance that made me where it was, which was the beginning. Several times the amount and Pam! I was hooked. Repeatedly. And more. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." This is just a soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I was set aside in bed with my Vaio game. Rain in flat roof and soft night again. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that crosses me, already relaxed. Popped in the DVD. I was fascinated. During the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> The Blob. Look. Steve Quinn, two policemen, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs way!
