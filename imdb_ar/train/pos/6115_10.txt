Have you ever wondered how far one movie can go? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia relentlessly explores an extreme world with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a hardcore, killer and drug addict, who will not stop at anything to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Driven by the devilish sounds of his own cast-up rubber doll, Harry begins to kill him. <br /> <br /> From the director Ron Atkins, the first installment comes from the harshest story ever filmed <br /> <br /> The only other film I've ever seen this looks like this will happen in the second release, Schizophreniac Necromaniac <br /> < This is a really low budget film and it will not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something that is disturbing, different and appalling, it would be a good choice. <br /> <br /> Do not expect anything as terrifying as the modern day (like screaming) <br /> <br /> It is advisable to appreciate the viewer
