It's hard for me to set a "fair" number of stars for this film, but I settled on figure 8 because of high production values ​​and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war movie. Also remember that I have not seen her since 1969. But she left a strong impression. <br /> <br /> "Death in a Long Day" should be one of the most anti-war films ever produced. This is done simply by portraying the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-1945 in very realistic terms. No film before this film showed war at the infantry level with so many brutal details, all in a coolly rotten way that allows actions to speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no emotional, no comical comfort, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their attitude - trying to survive - the characters appear in the form of familiar and familiar cliches. As "entertainment", the film does not make it, although it is clearly not meant as "entertainment". It was meant to throw you on your head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern warfare in general. This was twenty years before the platoon and thirty years before the rescue of Ryan, both of which were "distorted" films. Here flat figures are generally unacceptable, lack of a real plot, and unpleasant unpleasant images (including what may be the first vomiting on screen in theatrical history) is difficult to watch the film, although it only takes 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars of production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will feel when it ends, a bonus star for his heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl Foreman's "The Victors," an optimistic but more interesting and thought-provoking film, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. why not? Both films have been on the cable several times.
