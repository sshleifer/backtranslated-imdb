I do not know what is the subject of this film, I checked it in the video store and after watching it, I enjoyed it. The flick was not seen by Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glen Hildy, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this film is the end. However, it is worth the rent.
