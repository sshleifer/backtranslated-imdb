I've always said that animated Batman movies were much better than live motion movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animated films, but out of this group, these are the poorest, and they are somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasm" will be classified as Best, "Best of the World's", "Sub Zero", "Return of the Joker" and finally the last. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated film, there is a new mysterious girl in Gotham and Batman determined to find out whether her friend or her enemy is starting to look for revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce gets involved with three young women, he begins to investigate them and discovers who are the new bat. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is unusually light because most of the films are gloomy and gloomy and somewhat disappointing. Bruce behaves oddly about his character most of the time, the bad guys are reused from recent films, and while thriller scenes are exciting, they are not really new. He also lacks the great influence of other films, especially "Sub-Zero", which was heavy in the development of drama and characters. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film feels somewhat recyclable and the supporting characters are attractive but nobody really deserves rooting. <br /> <br /> All the time, I really enjoyed this, I was blown up, and the identity of the new girl was amazing, but it was not as exciting as I had hoped. <br /> <br /> (** Half of ****)
