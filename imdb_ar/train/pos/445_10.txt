I first saw the enchanted April about five years ago. I loved her so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. Two women decide to rent a castle in Italy for April, leaving behind life. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you can not help but root because they plan for this escape with two other women who invite them to share the expenses. Maybe this is a movie that I feel better than ever. It is pure and simple, with no car chases, no enmities or deaths. It was made with caution and a very good taste. You can only smile throughout it - only when you cry happy tears!
