The first film von Trier I saw was breaking the waves. Make sure the movie is beautiful but it definitely stands under the europa. Europe tells the story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany after World War II. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a tracer in a luxues train. Because of his job, he travels all through almost completely destroyed Germany, meets the killing of traitors, and looks for former Nazi Party members. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed his consciousness by focusing on the job he also had as a track attendant on the train. By chance, the main character in the bombing and terror is involved by a group called "wolves" who press him to help them put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is taken from one place to another by a man who tries to place the viewer under hypnosis and then prepares to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen so much !!!!!!! Europe!!
