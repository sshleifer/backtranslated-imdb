Roman Polanski plays Trilkovski, who rents an apartment in France. The former tenant in the hospital after a suicide attempt. Goes to see her there where he meets with Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's girlfriend. Stella became very close. Simon's death later. Telkovsky began to think that the owner and neighbors were trying to change him to Simon so he could also jump out of the window at the end. Lee Locater (Tenant) of 1976 is the last film for a trilogy apartment in Polanski. The former are Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.Roman Polanski not only does a good job as a director but his acting is also wonderful. Isabelle Adjani with her fantastic big glasses. The owner, Monsieur Zy plays by the great Douglas.Jo Melvyn plays Van Fleet as Mrs. Dioz. Shelley Winters's great film is The Concierge. The Tenant is a very scary thing from time to time. It gives a lot of this psychological fear. This movie is not easier to understand or explain but it makes everything very cool.
