I remember this movie since I was 12 years old, it was fantastic ... I remember that even today I do not like most of the things I saw at the time, so I tried to buy it but like a rocking horse like sh * t! Anyway, the acting is a little fun but the story is amazing because it was a real film with a low budget and amazing fighting scenes, I have to watch it about 20 times. It was a very good film and I loved the idea of ​​fighting the giant robots that you control. Unfortunately, they had to spoil it by producing a crappy game called "Crash and Burn." ! If you're a true Sci-Fi fan, watch it, if it's been remodeled today, it's going to be a winner. I really like to see a new version or even release a DVD from it.
