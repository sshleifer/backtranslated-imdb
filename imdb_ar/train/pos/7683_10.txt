I loved the good times with the rest of many of you. I like reading a smart and brilliant commentary. The book in this show was superb, and the actors were beyond the talented. To answer Strawberry22 (the best comment on the other positive and positive comment) ... What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a truck accident or a car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it was first broadcast and I was a little thing .. It was very sad for me. <br /> <br /> In fact, Florida and the children actually left the projects and EVEN became neighbors with Wilnona and so the last show ended. <br /> <br /> All children have achieved their dreams and found a chance in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their fate. I hope this type of ring is actually a reality for many. <br /> <br /> Fantastic view and many other great shows including Benson and Jefferson. This was a great time for African American TV and the best book was great at the time. TV LAND is great for memories and I love them just because I can not stand the garbage we see today. Some ... The 70s and 80s are back quickly ... Smart viewers are dying here, and we need better stuff. <br /> <br /> Love, a musical addict original TV series from the seventies and eighties (because she sings in "ALL in the Family" ... those were the days ......
