What if a platoon of Japanese soldiers were sent from the Japanese army within 400 years in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of Tokugawa Shogunate? The pitch is great is not it? The film does exactly what it says on the tin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the book did not bother to explain, which is often ridiculous in science fiction films, jumbo transfer of scientific time. No how or why. They just did. However, the chronological sequence itself is full of hell and very beautiful, if not a bit dated. Not as absurd as one might think. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows T. But while losing a great deal of activity through many of the sub-points that follow the arrival of GIs to Japan in the Middle Ages, you pick up with a devastating battle sequence. Be sure it's the main order of the day. Perhaps the whole idea, and thus the film itself, originated from this simple stadium: What if the company equipped with the latest in modern warfare was to fight the samurai? And the boy does it. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence of more than half an hour is likely to be one of his best films of the 1970s action / war films. Not only is it relentless and cumbersome in terms of speed and length, it is also a wonderful combination of styles and techniques that are characterized by unique locations such as G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, anywhere else will you have the opportunity to view tanks, ninja complete with shuriikens, helicopter and samurai in the same shot? Jie platoon led by Lieutenant Eba literally tears through hundreds of additions, shooting them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mix of mash styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the jidai-epic geki of the Kagemusha of Kurosawa or the samurai banners of Hiroshi Anagaki, while the other is in West films and motion. There are stylistic touches (such as the brilliant shots of slow motion and bloody violence) that transmit Sam Beckenba or Enzo Gee. Castellari to Kyuma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by Westerners and other Hollywood works and vice versa. The samurai transforms this melting pot of east and west without effort into an exciting film. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, the filmmakers took it all seriously, and the film benefits greatly. The mentality of the tongue in the cheek is not entirely absent. It just does not try to resort to a very bad audience, who laughs at its films. Perhaps the budget was huge, as is evident in hundreds of additions, detailed fashion (very suitable for the production of funky jidai-geki) and special effects. Camera work and editing are first class, and it is almost better that the film has no higher artistic ambitions it deserves. <br /> <br /> Of course, it does not eliminate its flaws. There are many "songs" scenes, where all kinds of rock, disco and Japanese songs are played in the 1970s on the montage (there is a bonding scene, a scene of love interest, the scene of "War is Hell" and so on). The songs themselves are beautiful, lame and discreet of everything. Although it is a 140-minute walk from the turkey, it flies mostly as a lead. It is still possible to cut some scenes, back and sub sections in the first half to make a more compact effect. <br /> <br /> The cast deserves mention, with names like Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin and Samurai Wolf), Tsunihiko Watase (Yakuza Leaf) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all of whom collide with the right notes.
