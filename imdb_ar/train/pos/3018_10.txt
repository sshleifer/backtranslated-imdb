This film is an exception to the rule that the sequel is worse than the original. Comedy at its best. This film is a fast-moving comedy where something seems to have happened every second. On more than one occasion, the whole audience laughed loudly at a joke. <br /> <br /> It's a great feature to watch the first movie but it's not a requirement. Has enjoyed the advantage of being a parody in the last decades of the production of the television series Reality Like the Survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish audience. So do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Enjoy! Johan
