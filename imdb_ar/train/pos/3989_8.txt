The mother tells of the mother of widows in her mid-60s who are found in the wake of her husband's death awake from a sleepless life because she has an affair with a young carpenter who also works as her daughter's married lover. The film revolves around my passive mother, her weak relationship with her son and daughter, and the silence she needs to calm down in her bed with her little lover, and the resulting convulsions. A somewhat antisocial drama with quiet psychosocial currents, the "mother" does an excellent job of dealing with real uncomfortable issues while avoiding unexplained excitement. Will play better with more mature audiences, perhaps women, who may better sympathize with the central character, needs and issues. (B +)
