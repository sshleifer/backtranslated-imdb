The sitcom revolves around a girl who must learn how to be responsible for her actions. Since she has enjoyed the power of magic, she has often used her to try to help her loved ones or herself, often resulting in a crafty pun that is usually disastrous and always humorous. <br /> <br /> The program began with Sabrina's high school adventures in the fictional city of Westbridge, near Boston, Massachusetts (against Greendale in comedy).
