From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say that this would be great!" I thought. It was very good acting, I felt as if I were listening to the lives of these people. The music also was wonderfully annoying. The plot began with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one can feel) towards some irrevocable destiny. The construction was slow, but I personally like this kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension is on track and not derailed until it is ready to pay. <br /> <br /> So, everything goes well, then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the balances are trading. "What?!!!" It was all I and my night movie companion could say. If you understand the intentions of the director, the awful end is logical (for those of you who have already seen the film, see the wonderful and dazzling interview with Larry Visenden in filmcritic.com), but I can not say that it was not pulled from the right. <br /> <br /> This could have been solved with less than ten minutes of pre-peak material. In any case, it's very bad. Those ten minutes had made all the difference in the world. (But for those who do not write or make films, you must know that drawing a story arc with the right timing is a big pain in the ass, and I certainly do not get this criticism out of any kind of statue!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo feels Lee like a masterpiece was abandoned before completion. But hay, I owned an expressive masterpiece on any day on an overproduction piece of dogs that was overly compensated with a lot of digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br /> <br /> One more comment. Some of the monster's scenes left me wondering if I was scared or laughing. I do not know how to explain it, but there was a distinct feeling in Monte Python about this monster in its most obvious "monster" forms. Although this may sound like a terrible critique of a horror film - I do not know, except that it was working me in a crooked way. I will not look at deer horns the same way again! :)
