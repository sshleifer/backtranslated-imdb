I've been watching Dick Tracy for years, and as a result has become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout my childhood and I was used to seeing it so much. His vision now, as an adult, is still a very good film - dark, cynical and incomprehensible. The only thing that can be said is Oscar's candidacy for Pacino - except that he is rarely discussed and did not make much noise when he was released. <br /> <br /> Pachino is overpriced but top to good effect because it has clearly a lot of fun. A wonderful Beatty like Dick Tracy and behind the camera managed to capture the atmosphere of Noer's best comic film comic of any other film, perhaps I've ever seen. Just take a look at one scene of the breathtaking film. Brightness, velvet and smoke / smoke combine to create a wonderful effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really ridiculous gamblers including one of Dustin Hoffman on behalf of Mumbles, and I do not think there are any drawbacks in terms of representation - even the mandatory personality of children is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> In general, a really wonderful movie has been misunderstood over the years since its release and has been underestimated by at least 5.7/10 average on IMDb. Reviews Critics are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) After watching the movie again, it is not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from elegance to exotic elegance. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 Stars.
