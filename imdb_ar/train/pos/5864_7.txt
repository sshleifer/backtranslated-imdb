I did not like the end of the buzzing world and overpriced now. My favorite film about the Vietnam War is probably The Deer Hunter. Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, then focused on prewar life. This movie is basically Deer Hunter 2. The script is very loose compared to Deer Hunter. The story has never been developed so that the public can understand people like Deerhunter and truly understand them. The memories of the past in Vietnam are not as strong or entangled as those of a monastery. That's why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the acting was fantastic. De Niro and Harris are really wonderful actors. They completely immersed themselves in their personalities and expressed their great pain for two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a half-lethal addict, hiding the guilt he lost in Bobby as he tries to save his life. <br /> <br /> I also love the support team. Everyone in the city is part of the film. It is clear that the city can not handle veterinarians in Vietnam very well. Like many smaller cities, it's all about calm, humility and thinking about work. Personal Harris, however, can not have any of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people thrive quickly, while others never recover.
