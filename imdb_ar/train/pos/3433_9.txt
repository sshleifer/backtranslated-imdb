I saw this for the first time in a foreign film festival. It is a remarkable step at a modest pace on a plot to reduce the Estonian treasury from a billion or so of gold. Everything was filmed in a brave and gracious manner rarely used by Hollywood --- but it captures the newly liberated Baltic states (remarkably: Tallinn actually looked less gloomy in 2003 when I was there). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor and some romance as well. I do not want to spoil a number of amazing logical surprises, so I will just say that this film steals from a wonderful scenario, and that the directing and the performances are first class. The darkness in TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking of this kind --- I put it in the face of RAFIFI and TOPKAPI, which is ahead of the 11 OCEAN's new miles, although it is (unintentionally) not shiny. Rent or buy it now.
