I do not remember this film that got a film show here. I only saw it when it came to the cable. The film deals with the dispossession of children from humanity to murder machines. One person is precisely the way he is replaced (literally) in a society outside the world where he finds himself unable to deal with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo's space, and we would have been pleased if it had been. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly happy that it was not - Kurt has done a good job of photographing Emotional Sloth. This scene shows him sitting outside the pool, although the decision to slow down will slow down the current time. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie the way Bladerunner, Alien, Silent. , Was running Logan or THX1138, yet unfortunately it is the closest I have seen in it for a long time. <br /> <br /> The movie has changed to a believable level, it does not break Arnie one's linings, Snake Plissken is not there, and there is no final happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this film did not work well. He did not follow the formula, and among a target audience of 18-25 years old, this is unforgivable because it was not what they expected. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> Always.
