Ghost Train is a wonderful and fun film, typical of the best coolers of British comedy in the 1930s and 1940s. Strange actor comedian Arthur Asky is not as funny as before, but can be overcome by seeing him as a piece of time or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For a low war-time production, Ghost Train is an atmospheric, effective, and provides some real thrill. Great fun for a dark night (and yes, a storm). Relax, take off the critic's hat, enjoy.
