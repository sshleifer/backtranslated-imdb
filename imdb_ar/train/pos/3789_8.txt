Bravo to the Czech Republic, the once-powerful film industry seems to wake up from the post-communist hibernation. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy that has been accomplished with all the elements that you expect to see in the production of "modern" Hollywood minus the trash that seems to have been attached to this genre over the last few years. Fantastic soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague city, to name a few. <br /> <br /> The story actually consists of several sub-stories that are intertwined and intertwined, which are essentially a set of destinies, destinies and desires ... A group of urban youth follows the mid-1930s through a variety of situations ranging from daily life Recreational activities to occupations and concerns. And it's hilarious. In fact there is a point in the film where the entire theater (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed nonstop for 40-50 seconds. How often do you test this with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the entire master crew is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonian star of Abina Mitivska in the role of an immigrant facing very familiar difficulties), Jerry Machik must be singled out for his brilliant portrayal of Jacob, a staunch Bohemian stoning whose brain is heavily influenced by things Which he smokes landing in a large number of ridiculous positions. <br /> <br /> I miss this one! I've got a lot to offer.
