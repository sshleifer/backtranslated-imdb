Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of money problems. He is crazy about owning his own house and rules, because his brothers have always stolen his saved money and his people are neglecting his wishes. One day, Preston was riding his bicycle; it was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to scap the police and ran the car accidentally over the Preston bike. Need to be far from the police, Quigley gives in a hurry, to check to cover damage to the Preston bike. The problem is: I've had a blank check! Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on this check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston things he always wanted, like a palace with a swimming pool, lots of games, and even a limousine! Problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where they are, making Preston in a difficult position and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
