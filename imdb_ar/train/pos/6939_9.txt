I was very impressed by this film. I would like to establish it as one of the best westerners of the classical era. I say this for the whole thing: the mature representation dialogue, the nonsense story, and the excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> The director Anthony Mann, who has done many well-filmed movies at the same time, has also done some Westerners like this one. It has the same appearance as Noir film. Man and Jimmy Stewart collaborated with many Westerners during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In short, the story revolves around the man "Lin McAdam" (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he got in a yard. Then she was stolen and moved from the wicked to the wicked. All these bad guys are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Aiding Stewart helps this interesting tale, such as Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. However, there was little extension to see Hudson Rock playing an Indian role ("Young Bull"), but you can not get it all.
