I saw the "passer" yesterday and I thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood cycle in the lives of the three main characters: Ramalo, Manuel Tor and Francesca. After that, he jumped about 10 years to a hospital where the three friends met again. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexual violence are rampant throughout the production of the film and the intense film full of tension. <br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too cloudy and I think they have missed the point of the story. It is a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. Cry. To be hurt. Bleed. I believe that what the film is showing is not done to get the value of a pure shock or to present it in a bad way. I know that some people like their movies "clean", even those who have violence in them. But sometimes, the film needs to make you feel uncomfortable working. This is one of those films. The movie is awesome. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments where some of the details of the plot were not 100% clear, and only after thinking at the end of the film, is everything logical. But they were not of great importance to the overall story, so I still give this film 9.
