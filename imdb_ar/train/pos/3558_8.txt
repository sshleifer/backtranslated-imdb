Along with the South Pacific, the Guys and Dolls are for adults - it's rude, sexy, and full of men and women who train. <br /> <br /> There is energy and a drive that makes it stand out through the beam - the power of Jean Simmond's performance, and the charm of the young Brando, as well as the astute Sinatra adds a lot to the overall appearance of the piece. <br /> <br /> Men and puppies won as it is shamelessly what it is: MGM Music. <br /> <br /> It's still good to look at and listen to great tunes and tunes - it will remain one of the 20th century's classics and will be seen with fun for years to come. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
