Probably the best fantasy film ever. Luxurious color, amazing collections, incredible, musical spot on Miklos Rosza Musical is perfect for every scene and mood. Representation acts admirably in what could have been a harsh homeland in less hands, but the poetic dialogue here speaks brilliantly and sensitively (humor is subtle and exhilarating as well). <br /> <br /> Without a doubt Spielberg and Lucas have been enchanted by this one. As well as "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of Alexander Korda's best-selling animated films, London Films --- and one of the coolest animations ever made. <br /> <br /> A real classic and attractive image!
