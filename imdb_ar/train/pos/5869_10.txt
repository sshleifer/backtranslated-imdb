After watching The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece, Jacknife had great shoes to fill. It has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, and devastating effects on someone after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro in this film, as in The Deer Hunter which is very good here as well as Cathy Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, who delivers a strong, emotional and touching performance. The film is based on a theatrical theater, and there is one or two scenes where it seemed so obvious to me. I mean, just for the viewer or the audience, I felt like I was watching a play. It was not that big and did not really reduce the size of the film. this movie. Not an epic like The Deer Hunter. It revolves around a similar era and has similar themes, but they are very different. I thought Deer Hunter was fantastic, I also think this movie was fantastic. In this it makes them so wonderful. For me, Jacknife is 10/10
