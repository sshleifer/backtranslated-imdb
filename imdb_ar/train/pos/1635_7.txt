In my high school days in Salina, Kansas, they filmed something called "The Brave Young Men from Weinberg" locally, and the film crews were fairly prominent for weeks. In the end, we learned that the film was "Up The Academy", and a few princes had a "less brow" than we could believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see him, where I was there, and the local audience seemed less than happy with the show. I was 17 years old, and I thought it was a somewhat unsuccessful attempt at a type of "comedy house" kind of comedy, down to fart jokes. <br /> <br /> I've seen him several times since then, and my opinion hides a bit. It's stupid, but sometimes it catches a bit of "crazy" humor, at least in addition to most "Mad TV". Ron Lebman may hate it, but it is almost perfect, and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment was a short scene on Santa Fe Street, where I stopped my car while I was buying some guitar strings. Very bad Pinto appearance appears very short, it seems to be cut on TV. I have not seen the new DVD, but if the old Pinto is visible, it has got a sale.
