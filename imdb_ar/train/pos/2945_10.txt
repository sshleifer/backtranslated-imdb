I watched this movie several times in the 1990s and almost swore by laughing each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this attitude is something else. he is very funny. Even P.C. You'll find this brigade hilarious. It is a must watch, and even better if you've got men or girls for a drink. If Michael Jackson takes off like him, if you close your eyes, you think he sings. The things he describes are true in life, and you'll have to seriously get a sense of humor if you think this was not funny. Local video stores are not storing this video anymore, but I'd like to get a copy of my hand to show my husband and my children when they're old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
