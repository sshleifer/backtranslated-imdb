A policeman accidentally kills one of the suspects in a murder and then covers the crime, but he must deal with a guilty conscience while trying to resolve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney were reunited with director Breminger in an effective film such as Laura, their former collaborator. Andrews is ideal as a serious cop, a good man who has been in unfortunate circumstances. Good acting everywhere, including Melden as a tough police chief and as Terni's protective father. Screenplay Hecht, a great scriptwriter and prolific producer, is taut and interesting, and Preminger creates a wonderful atmosphere.
