This film is a wonderful lesson about Japanese history started at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before Shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalists, who wanted the emperor to return once again to the throne of Japan's rule. Really, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) offers a great performance like Izo Okada, one of Hitokiri's four (= Human) Killers) from Bakumatsu. It is the simple Samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes the power of the Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryunosuke from the sword of death). Hanpei is a hard-line nationalist who allows his group of Hitokiri to assassinate many pro-Western pro-Western politicians to achieve his political goals. His leader Izu Okada follows without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he had the money to go, drink and spend in his prostitute. The killings in Okada have become more brutal in the context of the film, and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful picture of the simple Samurai life that engages in political affairs, and it is really na√Øve to realize what is happening. First, after being betrayed and tortured and always in talks with Sakamoto (a samurai who rejects violence), does he change his thoughts and views on life. But it is too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsuo and the rest of the staff perform wonderfully. Each actor reaches their turn. The sword fights a unique and fast game ... probably faster than many movies at present ... <br /> <br /> Check it out if you have the chance !!!
