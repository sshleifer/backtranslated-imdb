I took this film as a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 to 5 times to see it, until I realized what it was like. First, he describes WW2's face that we do not usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the facts that impressed me most was what I mentioned, at the end of the film, about a murder in a forest in the 1920s ... that forest is the place where the last chapters of the Berlin Alexanderplatz occur: that is the forest where Reynold Mieze is killed. Another guide for those who like detail, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people each time they walk through the door, or the door is opened. Many doors appear on the screen, opening and closing. The characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. at any time happens. Have you noticed that?
