You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and it is possible that the novelty will not fade in the first, second or third viewing, but you will attract very simple and interesting characters, so you may find yourself actually taking care of them in an unexpected way that may make you feel or Do not make you feel a bit childish because of the means. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to retain the power of "The World's Greatest Animation," with "Insect Lives" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative accessories being the exhilarating "external applications" is added to the end of the film. The DVD contains two sets of these drag operations where you tell a VHS tape that has one copy rotated for each tape. The DVD also contains "Gerry? S", a great short PIXAR movie that was also shown before the movie in the theaters. <br /> <br /> This is the best insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which is very good, but lacks something in animation and in the evolution of the story and characters. If you look at the sounds of the stars in both films, "Antz" is largely filmed with big-name movie stars with some of the famous "TV" sounds, where "A Bug? S Life" is exactly the opposite, TV stars with Kevin Spacey as the only outstanding exception, but the difference in quality is distinct and clear. <br /> <br /> DreamWorks can not be blamed or surprised when you deal with Disney, your work is impossible for you. Who makes me wish I had children to share with him.I do not think for a second that this is just a children's film.
