I read the negative comments before watching this film and did not deter and started to watch. I admit I had to rewind several times because the film is very complex and engaging and full of detail. This is a good thing, but also, completely unexpected in the culture of car chase, blasts, unexplained sex and public violence that replaces the evolution of the plot and personality. In fact, what a pleasant departure, however, I'm used to not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character development and plot line; the kind we used to analyze when you were in high school. Requires real mental participation by the viewer. What a nice change. I would like to compare this to "all the men of the president" in terms of the general subject. That is, it is a riddle of intense misconduct on the part of elected officials with sufficient influence on officials to "own" them. <br /> <br /> In contrast to "All the Men of the President," this film makes an effort to give two real personal characters. In this sense, the film is considered a personal study such as "The Negotiatior" with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, their characters from the city staff and the scheme is very intense. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, trust each other, and eventually unite against the corrupt police administration. There are more firearms fires in this film and the specific plot is different but in general, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the City Hall requires much more focus. In fact, I was struck by the extent to which the past and present political scandals that I have seen in my life come back to Watergate. The thing is, the public knows that there is something wrong, certainly! But after the details is difficult to do. This film is not close to being as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic on life in its complexity. I think this is one of the reasons why the previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If one sees this and knows what is about to see and reaches the experience, it is truly wonderful! I saw it 3 times in a row! The representation is superb and the guidance flawless. The weakest episode is John Cusack's tone.
