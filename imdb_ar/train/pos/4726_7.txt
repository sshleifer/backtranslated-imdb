The origins of this film are a puzzle for me, since I only know as much as IMDB knows before I hire it. I suppose before the word "Starship Troopers" Killshot was one of countless unfair pilots who did not reach the network, cable or otherwise. The new title "Kill Shot" is subtitled sequentially in the opening series, and is the first among many quick keys that were not intended for cinema. Fast tracks, Melrose Place music, and short, close-up shots of key actors let you know what you want. <br /> <br /> I do not mind everyone. I hired this film to see a re-packaging that Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards put on the cover in front of a volleyball network believing it would be funny to see them in a movie alongside SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not too hot a movie - but This is another review). After looking at IMDB, I and my roommate thought that the pilot had been dragged after the apparent success of his Troopers and Richards career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things here). They threw in a sexy scene with a simple character to get to the desired R rating - reassuring in suspicious video rental sections, ie. Anyway, they should have left it undefined if you're trying to sell it in the pornographic / soft section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you he's a television pilot. This was the biggest attraction of his watching - when you watch a movie and get a television show, the differences between them make themselves more obvious than usual. <br /> <br /> Will I rent it again? No, will I watch this TV show? Well, no no - it's better than Baywatch. Their meager attempts to beat all demographics were very successful in the mid-1990s. (Japanese, I assume from Koji's name) is more skilled in science and computers than talking to women. A beautiful pre-schoolgirl has everything she does except her family's bank account - Maybe this offer will work well. <br /> <br /> But a sponsor will collapse for me only. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 movies of 10, considering what he was and what he had to become. I have made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask from rents.
