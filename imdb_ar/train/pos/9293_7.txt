Tip number one - Read the title as "Crazy Dog Time", or maybe dogs. It is a very good band piece (see the cast and hire it - you know you're curious), and for the first time the director gives them their chance, with his time, and lets the characters interact and chew the scene while he waits - not eagerly - for the "big boss" to come back. <br /> <br /> For some of us, as Christopher Jones sees after his self-imposed exile from films, he still has a leading film. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor, this is the "Wild Street" reunion!
