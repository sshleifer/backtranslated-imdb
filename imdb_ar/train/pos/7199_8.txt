The playwright Sidney Bruehl (Michael Kane) is featured in a series of flop games after great success. He receives a play written by a student from Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) and is fascinating. It's good that Sydney says he will be killed for that. Is it? <br /> <br /> A thought-provoking man. It was originally a play ... this shows. Most of them in one group and all the talk but I never felt bored. It's very well written with lots of transformations and a full cast labor force. Cayenne is as wonderful as Bruhl - another one of his wonderful shows. Reef, surprisingly, is very good. I did not think much of him as an actor, but he is really good at this role. Dyan Cannon wonders about the role of a registered wife as Bruhls. Irene Worth is also good (and very funny) like Helga Ten Drop, Psychic. However, she did not get her accent on my nerves. Director Sydney Lometh works well with one set. The camera always moves and keeps your attention going. Extreme Dead Extreme Before you wait !!!!! My only complaint is that two homosexual characters in this film show that they are social irritants and have one of the most non-aromatic kisses I have ever seen - but these are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good film critics hate this film (for some reason) seems to have disappeared completely since its debut in 1982. This is very bad - it deserves the best.
