I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host of the series. I hate celebrity gossip and hate talk shows generally, but when Hal Sparks hosted the talk talk show, I had to watch TV for me. I rarely miss a loop while running it and I was sad when the hosts started flocking (although most guests still do a good job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they should not be watching weekend offers. Long episodes of Talk Soup included the best sections of the entire week and were covered in initial comedy bits. The original pieces were made by Hal Sparks Farhana. In one he got by a bad comedian demon, and in an evil exterminator like the scene weave his head as he said dated jokes about the airline's food. One episode was dedicated to Multiplicity, where a collection of cloned Hal Sparks continued to reproduce during the episode, and the studio continued to run. <br /> <br /> Well, it may not sound funny when I describe them, but all I know is that along with Talk Soup, the only other programs I've seen consistently during those years are The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian . So, if you like the comedic forms of those shows, you're likely to love Talk Soup during the years of Sparks. <br /> <br /> However, Henson and Tyler were both great hosts. The three hosts brought something different on the table, but they were all comedians in my opinion. Of course, throughout the years of Tyler and the star of the guest, my interest in this exhibition has diminished, but every now and then I pick up the "soup", the spiritual caliph of the show, and certainly enough, the new host can bring some somewhat unexpected laughs from time to time . <br /> <br /> Well, I've wasted enough time talking about a television program that no longer exists on the air and on a channel that I generally despise. Go watch something else!
