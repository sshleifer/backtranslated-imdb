If this is supposed to be a picture of the American serial killer, they appear on average decisively. <br /> <br /> The journalist travels across the country to California to document the most famous killers of America, without knowing that one of his white trash companions in the Bait trailer is a serial killer himself. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat predictable, it has moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I did not want to see it again.
