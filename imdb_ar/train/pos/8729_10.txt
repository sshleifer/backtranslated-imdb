A Bug's Life is a very good feature of animation. This film is for younger children, but it's also a great movie for people of my age. The story revolves around an ant named Flick. He brought chaos to his colony when he destroyed the food that had to be superior locusts. He gets exiled and must find the biggest bugs to fix the mess. This film is classic because it is a good movie and Pixar film. The animation is especially impressive in the late 1990s. The story is good, but more details will be enough. Sound representation is as good as with most animated films. Nice music to listen to. Nothing special, but he got nominated for a music category. Overall, I was struck by this film as a clash. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
