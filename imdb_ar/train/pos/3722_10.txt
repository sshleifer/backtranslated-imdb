First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it, I just learned that Joel Schumacher did so and that was enough for me. I and a friend went to see him at a Danish film festival called the "Night Film Festival", which is a lot of different films that are shown hours later. The festival specializes in films that will not be shown in Danish theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and were amazed by the truth of the matter and it seemed to really hit our feelings. We were caught in the plot without being able to discover the ending which is a wonderful addition to our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a way that reminds me of the Danish initiative "Creed 95", which was initiated by 4 Danish directors, including Dancer In The Dark. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film deserves to see that it gives a different perspective on how things were for GI GI Joe expects out of school to serve their country in the battle away from home. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell was also exceptional in this film and I have never seen him before, but I can not wait to see more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
