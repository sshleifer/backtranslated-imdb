Convincing and innovative! At the start of the criminally debated "Wobi Goldberg", the book draws a tie between Theodore Rex and the classic book "Citizen Ken" by Orson Welles. The book is justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallelism, but the audience is often fooled to see Hollywood's overly overrated appreciation of the exact similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and supporters, just like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This movie revolves around finding love in everyone's differences. It is an epic test of fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex have co-authored the dyad throughout the ages, with the only justified comparisons being Bogey, Bacall, Hepburn, Tracy, Hall and Oates. If you want to see a sophisticated celluloid examination of some of the deepest human motives; Bergman-esqe but not as depressed, theodore Rex should be seen immediately!
