Well, what I'm saying: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I am a huge Nancy fan and I read all the original books from 1 to 56 and went to read more. I am now at 96. Beware of the bad guys who give this film too little. All the clues point to a wonderful movie! I love it all. So what is Nancy at the moment? It is still as old as it is in books! People who have not read more than five books complain about Nancy's point of view. I have read them all and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the film nervous. I love the exciting car chases and get away. I love the clues. I solve the puzzle myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you see it because the people who were complaining knew nothing about A and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. Oscar may not be worth it but really a good movie.
