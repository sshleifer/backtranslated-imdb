The first of Tarzan films staring Johnny Wismoler. The plot has already been summarized so I will not go back to it. He only knew that the actors who played Gene and Turzan were born for this role. If you have not seen this movie and you only have Tarzan modern films as a reference .. you are missing a real treat. It does not matter how much we have entered the film industry and makeup group designs ... No one will ever play Tarzan like Johnny Weissmuller did. It was the Tarzan.
