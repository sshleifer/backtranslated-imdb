This miracle of the film is one of those films that have a lasting long-term effect on you. I've read a review or two of the angry people I think are either Republicans or children, and their extreme remarks about the ability of films to confront people with their darkest secrets. There is no such art that combines laughter and tears in myself before and this is a miracle film. The realistic film and its performance should not be missed by Brett Carr. The nature of the semi-interactive effect will make people leave the theater either liberated or asking about their identity. Bravo on the next level of cinema.
