Vow to cherish is a wonderful film. It is based on a novel with the same title, which was equally good, although it is different from the film. Really make you think about how to respond if you are in the shoes of the characters. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, everyone! <br /> <br /> Although production is not Hollywood quality - there are no great special effects - still, values ​​and ideals are portrayed more than compensated. The team did a great job of capturing the emotional bonds between family members and the devastation that occurs when someone gets sick. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss this!
