I watched this movie tonight, the opening night. It was great !! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was one of my favorite things. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quid, if I read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where she lives ..... she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... kinda stood for you ... but she did not You mean: C) [Not that anyone would think that ...]) Anyway, it's a great movie. Anyone who likes a good sports movie, has to come out and see! : C)
