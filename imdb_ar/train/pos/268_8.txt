I loved Didi Pfeiffer (is that true?) In Saybel. I have not seen her for some time and forgotten how much I missed her. I thought she did a wonderful job in this. The cast was very very good. At some angles, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The hijacker was very creepy and the story generally had some good twists. The young friend was Hotty. I thought the husband certainly had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> You just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. I keep my interest and I will see it again when they turn it back on. Can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? You can post on the blackboard or send me a private email if you want. thank you In advance. Aboutagirly.
