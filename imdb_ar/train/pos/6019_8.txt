ZP is deeply associated with the dream of youth represented by the Hippies movement. The college discussion at the beginning of the film illustrates the cultural situation that gives rise to that movement. The explosion that Darya imagines represents the fall of all social structures and thus the development of this enormous transformation of the society and finally the death of Mark predicts the end that sees the movement itself. The film will be understood more easily if we go back to that time in life. During the '60s, young people were the driving force behind the profound explorations of change. It was one of the most important changes that I meant to take out sexuality from the treasury. I think that the scenes in the desert do not represent an abomination, but the sexual relationship that men and women perform in absolute freedom is in a hypothetical situation where no one can hide from. I watched the scene where the couples threw sand at each other and appreciated the wonderful way in which A depicts the impossibility of continuing to hide this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to "control" social unrest at the time, and this is how the police apply to stop students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and this is clear when students get weapons that go beyond all false controls. The dialogue between the policeman and the college professor, who was detained for no reason, appears to be part of a society that is interested in the feelings of young people and part of which is totally uninterested. When flying as a more accurate symbol of freedom, the plane's theft represents Mark's inner desire to do so, but the return, return, or return (segun) shows the difficulties of being freed from these connections. As I said, the death of the dream portrays these difficulties in winning the game. In my film to remember him.
