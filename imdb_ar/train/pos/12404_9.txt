I was living Rawlins when this film was produced and I am fortunate enough to be able to work on it. Both as an addition and with Eddie Sorkin on special effects. It was great to see all the works behind the scenes, from Barbedwire and they thrive to the electric chair up to the office floor. It was also a lot of fun in interviewing all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall of the movie was and still is called "Disney Gate" by locals. If anyone is interested in Rawlins at all, most of the film sets are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. I've had so much fun working with R. Harlin and I wish I had the opportunity to do it again.
