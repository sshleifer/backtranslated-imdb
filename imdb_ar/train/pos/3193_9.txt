The short story that begins this film is a real footage of a person named Gary, who appears to have been filmed randomly in the parking lot at a television station where Gary is working in Beaver City. Gary is a little "different". He is impostor and leads the old Chevy named Farah (after Fawcett). Lo and behold, the director gets a letter from Gary and later invites him back to Beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he has collected, including Gary's stunning performance as Olivia Newton Don. The two short stories are the story of Gary, the same story I've just seen, first portrayed by Sean Penn and the other by Crispin Glover, The Orky Kid. If you are in the mood to make fun of someone, this is definitely the movie you should watch. I have doubled my laughter through most of them, especially the Crispins performance which can stand by itself. When it ended, I had to return the movie to see again the real Gary and all his brilliant folly. Although Olivia was the focus of attention, I wanted to see one of the "phantom" pants swaying in the impersonation of Gary Barry Manilo, which was equally ironic.
