I have one word to tell you this movie, Wow! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater were crying. This film shows Darius's difficulties with muscular dystrophy. The film was well made and made part of the film. I was emotionally touched by this film because it made us remember that we were very lucky because we were in quite good health. Some people in this world are less fortunate than us. Sometimes we have to give them the opportunity to help them, to the end. They gave Darius a chance when they were not asked to do so, and they did not do so for the money they did for a needy friend, and Darius, the world must know, and Darius went west.
