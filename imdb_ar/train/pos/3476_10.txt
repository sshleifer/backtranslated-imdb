Let's move on to the chase: If you were a child, I spent some time wondering about the fact that McCartney in 1976 had the ability to evade John's life in the city and spend his day with him. You certainly wonder how things went. I heard the same reports that the writer of the film heard, from John and Paul's point of view, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in the same way that the film works. But none of my perceptions can buy tears in my eyes in the way that wonderful work and action do. I found it amazingly lifelike, perfectly reasonable and 100% saccharin free. Now, can anyone explain why I did not hear about this masterpiece before viewing it at CBC last night? I mean it's already three years, for good! And yes, if you are a Beatles fan, this is a must! Even a subtle rework of the Beatles' tunes in the background inspired.
