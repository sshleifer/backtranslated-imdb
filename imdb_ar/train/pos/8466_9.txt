Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is already predictable (TALK RADIO because we really know what happened, THE BOOTH because - let's face it - type and basic setup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. This means, in essence, that filmmakers are not finally deployed in the way they might have, for example, an American version of this story. BOOTH moves steadily towards its end, but is beautifully designed at every level so that one can enjoy the trip in such a way that a person can enjoy a cruise along a well-traveled (very scenic) road. It reminds me of the scary little Harlan Ellison story, Flop Sweet. The fear of indoor is, at times, almost obvious. Worth a nice long look.
