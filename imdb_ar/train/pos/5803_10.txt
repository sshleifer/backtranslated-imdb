Wow, I forgot how wonderful this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking at the garage. It is a kind of strange mix of Michael Jackson's autobiography, a collection of musical short essays, and a story about a great hero fighting to save some young children. The best part of this film is the super hero clip, where Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (which is just as strange as it seems). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough brilliant photos and wonderful music to entertain all the time! <br /> <br /> However, the real jewel is the stunning video "Smooth Criminal" that makes the movie worth having this part alone!
