Bill Paxton plays a leading role in directing this very original film. After I first saw you in good shape. The reviews I heard were OK. As a result, I was expecting a film that was at the most exciting. However, taking out the Paxton film and producing it excellently deserves to be seen, especially if you are a fan of the horror film. Closing credits. The strongest point is the movies that I must say are very authentic and just as I have seen before. Well done to 2 young leads that completely convey their emotions if these boys are confused. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend it to everyone.
