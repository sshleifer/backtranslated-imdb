I thought this film did a good job down. It was not as creative or original as the first, but who would have expected it to be. It was a complete fun for Lota. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it, and when it was put on a DVD, I would pay for it with great pride, every last cent. Sharon Stone is wonderful, she is always so, even if her film is terrible (the Cat Woman), but this is not the case, this is one of those films that will be taken lightly throughout his life and is likely to become a classic film in 20 years. Do not wait to be a classic, see it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece or something wonderful and touch the soul, just let yourself out of your life and involve yourself in their lives. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is fun and I recommend it to people who have not seen it, because what the critics and the library say is not always calculated, you see it yourself, you never know, you may just enjoy it. I direct my hat to this film <br /> <br /> 8/10
