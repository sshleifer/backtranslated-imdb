John Waters is the most accessible film to date in one of his best films, as it eases both the zeal and frank vulgarity that seems to fill most of his previous works. Sure, nudity and sexual references are still present, at least being presented in a way that can not be considered too unpleasant or disgusting. Due to some wonderful selection options, this film has really shown the strangeness associated with the modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and somewhat exhilarating (if possible for Waters), this is one of the movies I watch on a rainy day.
