"Plainsman" represents the dexterity of directing Cecil B. DeMille in the most inaccurate and unrealistic. Bill Hickock (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bell Cody (James Ellison), Calametie Jean (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln for interaction, even though Lincoln was actually dead at the time The story happens. From time to time, DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but just as easily moves away from it to a scene and a fuss. The film is an attempt to support the last position of Coaster with a pile of imagination based only on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured materials and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - the spirit of the times in entertainment records, but it remains a very beautiful according to today's standards. , With eggs often clean and very solid black. There is a large amount of film pills in some scenes and their absence at other moments. All in all, so the picture quality is somewhat inconsistent, but it is not all bad or never good? A little better than halfway. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies distract attention. The sound is mono but well balanced. <br /> <br /> Extras: Forget it. It's universal! BOTTOM LINE: As the false history of celluloid is painted, this western is compelling and enjoyable. Just take her characters and story with a bead of salt? in some cases ?? The whole box seems more convenient!
