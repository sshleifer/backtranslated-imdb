Like other people who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I accidentally stumbled upon this little jewel on television late at night without ever hearing of it. The strange combination of a fictional story about a thrilling but unscrupulous heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-thought-out portrayal of the war in the trenches, on the other hand, made me comment from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the top five films about World War I (other films are "All Quiet On The Western Front", "Paths Of Glory", "Gallipoli", "La vie et rien d'autre" "After the war"). The scene with a poison gas attack is very frightening. The horses and men show up as end-of-the-world travelers with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I wish I had recorded the movie.
