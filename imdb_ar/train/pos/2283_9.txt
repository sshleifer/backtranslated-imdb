I have not yet read Kurt Vonnegut's book, but I am familiar with some of his other works and I was interested in seeing how it would be translated into the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It is about an American story that lives in Germany and was recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to attract himself to high-level Nazism and send secret messages to the US via his weekly radio program. But when the war ends, he is convicted as a war criminal but flees to New York, where he awaits many individual conspiracies. <br /> <br /> If the "Mother of the Night" is having trouble, they tend to be a little emotional at times. But for most of the film, schmaltz is preserved to the minimum and this alien plot is performed with skill and pleasure. There are some wonderful moments of black comedy, which includes three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a Nazi high in the prison cell. Highly recommended.
