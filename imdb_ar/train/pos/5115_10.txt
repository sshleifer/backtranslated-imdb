I have not seen this movie in theater. I concede bias against Vini Barbarino. Who the hell was John Travolta making films? I remember the Oscars that year, when Travolta seemed completely devastated when he did not win. How dare, when there were "real" actors running? I'm sorry John, you must have won. After capturing this movie on the cable years ago, she fell in love with the entire film. Bud, Cisse, Uncle Bob, Wes, it's all awesome. I also admit not going through it when I surf the waves. I stopped and watched. Over the years, I learned to do most of the dialogue and dance with my thumb in my belt, and I learned to appreciate more Travolta. The only thing that was disappointing for me was the supervision, on the soundtrack, on some music from the Urban Cowboy. The film "The Search for Love" is known, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that did not reach the soundtrack. It had to be a double CD ........
