******** spoilers - accurate ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I loved it and watched it countless times - and I usually discovered something new about it with every show. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about the working class, not the rich who live in Los Angeles or New York. Well, that's true except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays the role of Bud, a small boy from Texas who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. This is the time that Travolta has already played good dramatic films like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing bad guys / guys in big budget movies. It's a really good movie - the mechanical bull ride and the two-stage dance may be silly, but you have to enjoy it the way it is. <br /> <br /> Buds meet with Sissy (played by Debra Wenger with Celtic Shine) - and soon after, they are married and live in a trailer of their dreams. But their relationship becomes a true battle of life between the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sisi wants to be with the real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not clear. Where can a bud prove to be a real man? He can perform his dangerous daytime work and ride the mechanical bull at night - it can be "urban cowboys". But Cisse wants to drive his small truck, and wants to ride the mechanical bull as well. Where does this sprout leave? While asserting her independence, Cisse is lying about riding the bull and flirting with the former rodeo star who is being tricked into prison and jailed - a true bull rider - Wes (who played very well Scott Glenn). Threatened buds, broken buds and sissy. <br /> <br /> Sisi collides with Wes, who breaks her. After Becomes became more abandoned himself, he became the boy's toy for Pam, a rich girl whose father is in the oil and all that it means. Sisi comes by trailer to clean it - Pam does not do this kind of thing. You write a letter composed to Bud, but the evil Pam rips and takes credit for Sissy's home business. <br /> <br /> Bud's Uncle Bob dies in action when the blows blow and cause an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to reconcile, but they are very stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull riding contest will be in Gilley's, and you know that Bud will win. Pam realizes that Buds do not like her, but Sissi did it for her. Wes tries to steal Gillis, but not to learn that Urban Cowboys, iPod, is saving the day and winning the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you may ask yourself why buds and sissy go to Giles for each night and "live like pigs". This may have contributed to their bad marriage. Or why buds did not stay with Pam - they were not so bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why did Bud and Sissy have such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to disassemble them? Marshall says to Bud, "It's Sissy that leaves a better bull than she does!" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy mocks him a bit - and says, is not that Bonnie Wright on stage!
