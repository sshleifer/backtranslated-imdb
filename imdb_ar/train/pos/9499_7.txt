A local warrior hunts a boy and girl because the boy was killed (by chance) the father of the warriors (or who was). They travel through the nature of the most exciting African regions. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is not good (except that the elephant child). But it is a very good adventure and not controlled, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which light up the film a bit). <br /> <br /> I gave this film 7 because of its African nature and work.
