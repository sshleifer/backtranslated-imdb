This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is one of my favorites for Pabst movies and I enjoyed it more than his most famous films starring Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). Both are very similar to the new realism films that the Italians mastered in the 1940s and 1950s. This elegant film called for the use of non-actors (ordinary people only) in everyday environments for the creation of intensively engaged films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film revolves around the French and German coal miners, so appropriately, people appear in roles like miners - not actors. The central conflict with the start of the film is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided on the border and German workers are not welcomed in the French mine, despite the existence of greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (beautifully illustrated in the dance hall scene) plotted the First World War to create a great disagreement among the factions - leading to a mentality against them. Later, the explosion caused a major collapse in the French and Germans refuse to sit down and do nothing. Risk their own lives, and prove that there is a real partnership between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film strongly criticizes xenophobia and tries, in vain, to convince the German masses to see the viability of war and hatred. It was an impressive film with some of the most horrifying images I've ever seen. Given the history, the effect of the film was minimal at best. It is a real shame. WESTFRONT 1918, JACACUSE (GANCE) and all the calm on the Milestone had wonderful messages of peace and harmony but in the end they were failures of swaying public opinion. Therefore, from a historical point of view, it is an amazing and sad remnant to be seen.
