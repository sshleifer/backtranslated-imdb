"Convicted" is a great kind of acting films. All the dialogue and personal interaction that takes place within it comes from the long winds of the late southern day. Thus, the life of her main character, Sol (Robert Duval). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foot. Six years ago, the film worked together on "The Journey to Wonders", a movie that seems to be full of motion compared to this film. Maasterson is not necessarily a good way out. In fact, it is hardly enough. The slow pace leaves a lot of space for the filmmaker Toyomichi Kurita, who broadcasts the film in the proper sense of light and warmth. <br /> <br /> Because this is a basically filmed play, with little way of editing or directing ingenuity, it all comes to acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no drawbacks here. Robert Duval and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), make real characters completely and are not interested in anything besides living. Lucas Haas, the young actor I was familiar with from The Covenant and Witness, plays a character much like his other early roles. It is quiet, withdrawn, somewhat afraid and sad, in some way. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> A title like "Convicted" may be an abuse of this film. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to create a more coherent Western image. If slow theater productions do not interest you terribly, you want to move that product as well. Otherwise, this may be exactly the film you wish to make so much. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
