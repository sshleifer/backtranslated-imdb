Los Debutantes is the story of two brothers who had gone to Santiago from the south after the death of their mother. Silvio, the eldest and most trusted brother in the street, gets a job with a hapless club owner after a naive Victor took his seventeenth birthday. <br /> <br /> While Silvio blooms under the tutelage of his boss, both brothers get involved with a sexy mistress and manipulating the owner, Gracia. When the film unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the precise and subtle ways that each person plays in the next stage. <br /> <br /> The film was well made, with a fast-paced cinematography. It is also very exciting, with lots of nudity and some fairly obvious sexual scenes. The common method now uses different layers of different views, out of chronological order. Many people hate such films because they do not understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies that use this device. The plot itself is not really new. There are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good films. <br /> <br /> When different layers are detected, our understanding of characters and their motivations evolves. Although the plot may be somewhat clich√©, it is smart and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would like to call it a fun film, worth watching, but it can not be remembered. I have not seen much of the films from Chile, and it is always interesting to watch the film Noir from other countries. Otherwise, hire them if they are available but do not lose any sleep if they are not available.
