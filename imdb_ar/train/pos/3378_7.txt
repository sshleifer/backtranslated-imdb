This film came to me strongly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, I've seen both The Simpsons and Futurama referred to in both, so I figured out "what the heck". The film brings home some "what if" that makes you realize how fortunate we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water as a matter of course. Interestingly, in 2022 men still shaved with one razor blade! It is nice that officials did not over-load the film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, and so forth. Some furniture has a beautiful appearance once you discover the meaning of it. Remember, "Tuesday is the day of Green Soilent"
