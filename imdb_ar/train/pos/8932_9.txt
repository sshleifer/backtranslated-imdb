The film is not visually stunning in the traditional sense. Does not offer a series of beautiful pictures. Instead it is an visually interesting film. It imposes on the bidder continuous processing or perhaps imagine the context of different shots. These kinds of things are easy to try but difficult to succeed. The film rejects the use of a crutch of some kind to help the less-than-full-time viewer get what is going on. Instead, it touches the film and moves across a number of different species. The trick of loving the film is the ability to enjoy this fun. I think 99% of North American viewers will not get it. If you try to determine the story of this movie, philosophical message, symbolic structure, etc., you will waste your time. There is none of these. The film manipulates only towards these and other types at times. The only unifying force in the film is Claire Dennis's sense of what suits everyone. There are very few long films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, ie, enjoying the power of judgment per se rather than simply absorbing experiences under concepts. The film usually takes the easy way and chooses for the simplest pleasure to understand what is going on. Most film is not art. Most films do not approach art. When the film does, as it does, and is still fun by a large group of viewers, it is a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find that the film is very simply involved in the various narratives through which it works. Tahitian's father, although not quite traditional, ends up making things fairly clear and simple. Dominates a lot.
