Yes I will say before I start commenting, this film is incredibly understated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is fascinating in her role as Katharine Tramel as with Maurice as D. It is an analyzer that was sent for evaluation after the death of a sports star. Glass is attracted to a tempting game Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> He was a good actor (apart from Thewlis). <br /> <br /> Stone is truly talented in this role. It's a spot, naughty and seductive and does not look older than it was on the first day. I really liked it (as in the casino). Morissi was also good. He has shown a lot of indifference in the role he needs. However Thewlis was lame. His character was destroyed and he was above all the way. I really sucked. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was not good in the first place, but Stone screamed to see it. Just ignore Thewlis.
