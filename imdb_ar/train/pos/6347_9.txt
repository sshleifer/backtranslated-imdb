How Grinch Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my almost favorite film of my first watch. Now, after eight times watching, she still has the same effect on me as she did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman of Framed Roger Rabbit have done a great job. From the adaptation of the Grinch story to the screen. The direction of Ron Howard led to the revival of the story, and Jim Carrey's usually active performance where Greenwich steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some critics have argued that it does not apply to the spirit or principles of the original story. After reading the original story, I must say that I can not agree. The film shows the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, it reinforces the story's impact by making it more personal by showing us how and why Grinch became what it was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They may not destroy the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it yet and you are someone who does not want to know anything about a story until you see it, you have to skip the following paragraphs .) <br /> <br /> I think everyone can be associated with the Grinch's terrible experiences at school. I think we all, at one time or another, were unpopular at school who were always chosen. I know I was ... That's why I personally sympathized with Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lu was of naive idealism, I believe that no one can be so bad, the heart is destroyed. When everyone turned on their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lu was determined to be his friend. If only everyone has such a position. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that might make the film a little better is to increase humor and adult content. It has already been somewhat restricted, but none of this extreme humor (such as when the Grinch first criticized the split in Martha May Whovier) does not fit a story like this. <br /> <br /> This person is a good way to be classy for Christmas, with a well deserved place next to the book and Chuck Jones as a chacon as a necessity every Christmas season.
