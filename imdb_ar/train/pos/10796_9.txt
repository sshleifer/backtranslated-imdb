If you are a fan of either or both Chuck Norris and Godson Mills, this is the movie you should watch. He has a lot of adventure in it. It is a wonderful follow-up to the man of the president. The chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Godson Mills, Jennifer Tong) is incredible. My personal opinion. This film with the original, has turned well, so that networks should think of turning it into a regular series. If you have watched the president, I recommend this film for you. If you have seen a man president: line in the sand but you have not seen a man president, let me suggest you do so.
