I saw this young naive villain when it was first released. He made me turn off like a child while I was leaving the theater, trying not to let anyone see him. So, when I saw her again now in 2007, I knew what to expect, and the preparations were ready and awesome as the moment approached. Fortunately this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I did not remember watching my youth - or perhaps I did not notice because of, was the artistic brilliance of this film. Use the memories of the past that tell a lot of the story without resorting to dialogue. The camera, which looks like a scene with the characters in the scene, works. Think of the opening when the street atmosphere crosses into dinner, where the camera moves behind the woman and the child sitting in a chair in the foreground, and the street scene is framed. <br /> <br /> The story itself, characters - abnormal, sad and brutally real. It is very moving to draw us closer to a human drama like this with people who may most of us. Then again, Joe and Ratso can be any of us. It should be '70 when I saw it. I remember that when I left the theater I was forced to find friends. After all these years, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a wonderful movie.
