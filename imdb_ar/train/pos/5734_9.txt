I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's work, because it provides viewers with very unique moving pictures with typical Lynch elements. After seeing most of his work, I naively thought I could predict the next Lynch step. I was wrong dead. Dumbland is something I never imagined under David Lynch. However, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to think of this very primitive primary character, and concluded that all the tampering, cruelty, brutality and disgust offered here reflect a bit of reality, and are accentuated by distortion. There are things in our life that we never stress, they are either disgusting or terrible, yet they surround us, so I take the courage to say, Dompland focuses on these pieces and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, although sometimes you will laugh at the perverted alien humor. It is a moving reflection of all the things we refuse to watch, its simplicity, its morbidity and its stupidity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. It exists only. Finally, if you're interested enough, you'll find typical elements for Lynch too. I recommend it to people tolerance!
