This wonderful show, will make you cry, this group really love people each other in real life, this shows again and again. Send me and let us chat. I've been to Australia and they really are talking like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and convey these great stories of right and wrong, and friendship with your children. I have 40 episodes on the DVD-R I have collected over the last five years. Watch the Five Mile Creek tribute on www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to extended music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are very cool!
