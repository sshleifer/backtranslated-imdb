Barbara Streisand in 1964 was still curious and probably raised more than a few eyebrows in the industry when CBS signed it for 10 years worth $ 5 million (none these days). But most importantly, Barbara and her manager insisted on creative control - and got it. I photographed this way of her, and often her vision turned into intelligence, wise, and unbelievable. The first session was opened with a title song (not specifically written for her), and Strisand raced through an impressive collection of songs associated with "I'm late" (from "Alice in Wonderland"! - She even keeps her ears vague and bristles and "a lot of Time to Shave "!); This is a totally enchanting, if not strange, selection and enjoyed it because it did not release soundtracks TWO. She slows down for "Make Believe" (which may be too slow), but the drama "How to taste wine?" Wonderful. A cute "child again" (with Streisand looking into a big chair - is this where Lily Tomlin got the idea?), As well as "Sweet Zoo" ("I'm a crocodile - no crocodile!"). "Act II is set in Bergdof Goodman in New York City, with Streisand Kooky represented in high-end fashion (when she stumbles on the mink, the audience watches the tape vibrate) Act III, before the studio audience (made up of fans of the potential lucky club), begins with a strong copy of "When the Sun Comes Out" For the fact that close to the erotic approach), followed by "Why Choose You?" (Perhaps her best early songs), the very fast "Lover, Come Back to Me" (eventually sank by the orchestra), and a variety of "Funny Girl "The end," Happy Days Here Again ", which is said to have lasted 12 processes, closes the clock in an amazing style. Sponsored by Chemstrand (a fiber manufacturer!), These gems move quickly in black and white, with jazz formations, Fashion and fashion collections. They really are not like that - this is about the special and Luc Straisend.
