This is the story of Australian commandos who were captured from uniforms after a raid. Since they are in uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The Japanese Military Court, out of admiration for its heroism, authorizes the warrior to die. Of course, under the Bushido law, this means that they will be cut off. Fate, like Westerners, is unprepared.
