Awesome documentary film. I've seen it on the original airdate and on DVD several times in the last few years. I was shocked because he was not nominated for the Oscar for Best Documentary of 2002, the year he was released. There is no other documentary approaching. <br /> <br /> It was recently shown on TV to celebrate the fifth anniversary, but I missed the "Where They Are Now" added at the end, but I was not able to capture this tuni now as a hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticisms about documentary filmmaking from a few in this list. I can not see how this can be done in a different way. They had less than 6 months to assemble this and get air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother has not had any projects in the four years since then. What did they not do?
