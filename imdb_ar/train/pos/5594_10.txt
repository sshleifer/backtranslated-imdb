(1933) (USA 1940) starring Hedy Lamar (Khedi Kessler) <br /> <br /> The world's first glimpse of 19-year-old Heidi Lamar speaks in the early moments of the treasure of the 1930s, Angelic Wedding Dress. This was the beginning of a legendary career. This was a wonderful introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to honor the silver screen. <br /> <br /> It's the night of Eva's wedding (Lamarr) and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic development. She went back to the only bed, and in a beautiful place, she manipulated her wedding ring when she was overcome by the realization of her husband's mistake. The husband seems more interested in order and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses superb camera angles and pristine framing to capture the great talent and beauty of Lamarr. With no words spoken in the first part of the film, they are able to understand our sympathy, our hearts and our support. This mix was prepared by the 1930 fans when they were about to see it when the film was revealed. "Ecstasy" was considered horrifying for her time ... some thought it was a scandal. <br /> <br /> She returned to her home in her father's house and divorce files. The next day, wake up with a full sense of freedom and happiness. She must only go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for horse riding and happens across a beautiful lake. In one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema, Heidi Lamar became the first person ever to appear in a major film. Her attraction in the forest and her thin adventure in the lake were strangely scandalous. But the masses could not move away. As with many movies today, the controversy has made it a movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Evil Eva's adventure tells her about a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who escaped in her clothes. After a critical meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic encounter was as controversial as the naked scene with its tantalizing waves of sexual excitement. However, Machati does a nice job in these romantic moments. Machai creates one exhilarating moment, when Eva seems to be really drowning in her new lover, using the wonderful early trick of the camera. <br /> <br /> The courage of this performance can not be overstated by Lamar. Many may have assumed that he was a professional suicide. Instead, she gained her worldwide fame and drew attention to Louis B. Meyer, who signed her contract with MGM. There are some really exciting moments in this film, even by today's hideous standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Again, Mattati was very intelligent with his picture, leaving much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we see which is very good. <br /> <br /> The meeting between Eva's former husband and her current lover may be inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes some unexpected twists in his final film, all of which leads to a great story and debut on the big stage of the stardom of the film "The Lime". <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this controversial issue, now try the movie and urge you to search for it in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worth it, if it is a pleasure to see Hedy Lamar. But the story is very compelling and the trend ahead of time. "Ecstasy" early treasure is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews !!!
