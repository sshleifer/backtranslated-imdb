After playing the devil in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to the roles of her sister / sweet wife and showed her ability to play the dwarfs with her best. She and Gloria Graham played the same kind of tram - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The movie I have reached is not of Oscar standards, but melodrama is strong enough under the able hand of Douglas Circus. There is an almost noisy look at the sudden opening scene, setting the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that included ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as main menus. <br /> <br /> Local squabbles between wealthy oil-rich family members are the main focus of drama, with a focus on strong supporters, Stack and Malone. Both take the opportunity with both hands and Stack, too, should have been awarded for his wonderful job as a brother, weak brother, drunk and desperate for his brutal motives. <br /> <br /> Mythical stars have less impressive work to do, but do with skill and usual conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their most sympathetic roles with calm authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as always in Sirk) but it does not stop me from thinking about the film. As a film of technicolor films in the context of "Take it to Heaven". <br /> <br /> Worth watching with some interesting shows from the entire cast.
