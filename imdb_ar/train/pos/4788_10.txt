This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: it has been glowing from within throughout the film. Music and cinematography held a mantra when little was happening on the screen. The slow pace was set on the way of travel (a riding mower riding with a large trailer) and was preserved through the background scenes, sounds and slow life of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened Alvin Street died in 1996 at the age of 76 years. Everything was quite real, as if the actors had already become personalities. Sissy Speek has performed impressively as a somewhat disabled daughter who has suffered a lot but is moving forward and always wants to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was ideally chosen and became a beautiful Alvin Street, a stubborn but loving old man wandering around Iowa to visit his strange brother, Lill, who had a stroke. Alvin has learned a lot of wisdom during his life, and it seems to show the best of the people he met along the way. <br /> <br /> The movie emphasizes the importance of family to this man, and hopefully, to all of us. I eagerly expect to see him again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, these films demonstrate his skills in directing. Farnsworth was nominated for Best Actor Oscar. In 1979, he was the oldest candidate ever for this award.
