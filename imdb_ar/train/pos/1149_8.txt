Fast paced and funny spelling about this original "reality TV", soap opera. The scenario of playwright Robert Harling is full of one irony. The best thing is the peak of a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improvisation and brain transplantation. Kevin Klein killed his lines, because of not wearing his glasses, is fun. "She will explore her mind horizontally within the next few houses." The magnificent cast is on the same page as the Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Choi, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Wobi Goldberg, Terry Hatter, Gary Marshall and Cathy Nagimi are all perfect. It's fun to see a molded click like you do in this movie. This classic somehow skipped the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. The result by Alan Silvestre is an extra bonus. It fits the soap opera with flaming air and melodrama.
