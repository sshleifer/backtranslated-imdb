I will not hesitate to put this amendment to "Death Trap" in the list of the top 5 best film clips ever. Cain and Reeves (a weak actor who has never really had a chance to do more than "fun" romances) and Superman play each other very well here, so Diane Cannon - whom I do not usually care about - plays an exemplary role, exploiting the value of disturbing her as an actress. > <br /> I am not sure that the comparisons of "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - a wonderful modification from one stage to another shows Michael Caen - true, or even just, yes, there are many common factors between the two stories. Battle of intelligence, the house in "Sleuth" is at least a character in the film as far as the actors - the house does not really have its equivalent in "Deathtrap." The "Deathtrap" Take a ploy about how people are not well cursed (and not as smart as they think) deserve all they get ... I'll just say that both films are great examples of the genre, and they deserve your time and your money - this is America, after all. I will not give up the twists and turns in the plot, but I do not think it's important anyway ... I've watched the DVD eight or nine times in twelve years and still enjoy the chemistry, timing and moments When things go "pearly." All this has been so well done that the journey has become more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and the thrill of Hitchcock's movie-making style will probably enjoy Deathtrap.
