This film is still a favorite all the time. Only a mindless fool will not enjoy this wonderful film. This movie looks like a slice of warm apple pie covered with French vanilla ice cream! I think this is the best work for Cher ever and her most credible performance. She has always been blessed with charisma, a beautiful appearance and a high, enviable personality. Whether you like singing or not - who looks like Cher? Cher has certainly made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered for a long time after others came and went. She is one of the most distinguished artists there. It's funny, because who would have thought Sher was a naturally gifted actress? Are the heads above the so-called "stars" movie today. Sheer is a true actor on the same level as Debra Wenger, Alvary Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett, and a few others, in that she never seems to be an actress. She has gained more respect for her colleagues and public respect for the films. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - characters, scenery, dialogue, and food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the scene where they all sit around the dinner table at the Rose house, I stop the remote control to see exactly what exactly tasty "Rose" food is serving. I saw spaghetti, mushroom (I think), but I can not tell if they eat ravioli, oily? What is this main course? It looks great and its driving me nuts! <br /> <br /> Everyone in this family was an industrious individual who respected and respected each other. Grandpa was not pushed aside and tolerant. He was a vital part of the family and was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seems to have been an old, healthy and independent blogger. <br /> <br /> Mom Loretta was not just a housewife; she was the glue that kept the family together and was an example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but did not allow her to determine who she was. High-powered businessmen are not comfortable in their skin like Rose Castini. "I had no children until I was 37. It was not over." I felt that she was the kind of girl who did exactly what she wanted and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick-witted, and very smart. What a wonderful mother! <br /> <br /> I did not like Loretta right away because she seemed to know nothing - everything was not as adventurous as she was controlling herself as she wanted others to think. She can tell others about themselves and where they made a mistake, but in fact she did not apply common sense to her life. She was married to a middle-aged Mama boy just because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose of her life. She was more traditional than her mother. She was wearing and wearing her hair as if she were in a house of detention and looked without spirit and serenity, but your sensitivity felt weak and sharp and she had a lot of love to give the right man. It is possible that it will end up making my wonderful mother too. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future, a house full of bright and bright colors, two small happy cries, and Rose and Cosmo each enjoying each minute.
