Louise Brooks offers a great show in this French-made melodrama. She plays a printed role called Lucien, despite her love for a man named Andr√©, and dreams of rising above her center in life. You see an opportunity in the beauty contest of Miss Europe, but Andre is angry when he discovers that she has entered, and then asks her to withdraw. She tries to regain her entry only to discover that she has already been chosen Miss France and will now move on to the main competition. <br /> <br /> This is a love story, a loss and a decision to be made by an emotional end. The film was filmed with great vigor by director Augusto Gina and cinematographers Rudolf Matte and Louis Ni. The style of photography is more like modern films than Hollywood films in the 1930s, and shows the different style used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and travel clips, often done with great skill. The high energy of the first third of the film dwindles slightly in the middle, but picks up again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good by all school principals, but the performance of Louise Brooks is not particularly memorable. Louise relies heavily on her own silent screen skills although this is silent, but because her silent style had an amazingly contemporary and amazing feel, she makes the transition to conversation very good. The long early scene in the exhibition was particularly impressive, with Louise using her rather expressive eyes to express her growing sense of misery and alienation, and locking her into a life she no longer wanted. I doubt it was done better. <br /> <br /> The film rises to a wonderful conclusion, beautifully filmed, powerful and elegant. This is really some of the best things in the early days of the film. The tragic story only underscores the great tragedy of Queen Louise Brooks. It was not just a gorgeous beauty that looked fantastic in swimsuit, it was already a great talent in acting all thrown away. We are all poorer in that. <br /> <br /> This film is less famous than its German films with G.W. Babest, but I think it is better. I think this crew is better at storytelling than Babest, and although Prix de Beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of Pabst films, it is easier to follow, which is a more streamlined and focused work. It does not hurt that the parts of Louise are also performed by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it's the classic Louise Brooks movie worth looking for.
