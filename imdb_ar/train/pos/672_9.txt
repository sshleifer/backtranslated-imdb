This animated image is characterized by a steady and exciting pace, supported by great representation (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that has been revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, music creates a full mood that helps keep your tone taut, alert, and alert. <br /> <br /> The story of Weir is reinforced by the use of indigenous people, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver an ominous fictional story. <br /> <br /> Although they are not relevant in the story as well as the genre, this kept the same feeling inside me as the "Lair of Paradise" by Ursula Le Guen (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic drama with some horrific moments. Remember that "hacking and hacking" does not make the film a horror film, it is the psychological component of the fear and fear that lies in us all.
