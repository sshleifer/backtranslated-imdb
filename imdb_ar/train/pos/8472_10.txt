I do not agree with that completely. I thought this was a great movie for kids. He blew the wells off the island of Gilligan, and promised to see Dana Plato, which was barely known at the time. They were not uncommon and could hardly be ignored as meaningless fuzz. It was not. It was scary and I was not supposed to be "not going to spoil the end," but it was unusual how it was done. I mean the children's figures were wonderful and I did not know what to expect in the end. The conspiracy had a greater relationship with these children than the fact that these children were expert fishermen was very essential in this plot, especially at first. It also helps them to get out of the jam in the end. Being very long, I think it works in less than 95 minutes
