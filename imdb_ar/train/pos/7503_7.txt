The film was fine, very entertaining. The cast was very good, and I would praise the comment I mentioned earlier - Glenn Cowen was fantastic and alone enough reason to watch this film. He played a selfish, "evil" friend and a master of the band brilliantly! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of songs by Beyond Gravity in this movie, but it's no surprise that the movie is actually VH1. However, if rock / pop music is not likable to someone, you may also move those scenes forward. <br /> <br /> A band plot is trying to make it top in Los Angeles, but it must be overcome. Many obstacles on the road are not very original, but they are very entertaining, with some amazing plots turning here and there.
