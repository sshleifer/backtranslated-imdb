Alan Chapp claims that the film is his original idea, but the subject of the reluctant lovers they finally collect is old, if not older, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shabat is "garcon vieux" and has one pleasure that no member of the opposite sex wants to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and mothers of mothers - G7 - decide that he should be married. Enter the delicious Gainsbourg Charlotte, etc. A simple plan should be. Charlotte has to form a young girlfriend, and then does not appear on the wedding day. No more talk about the marriage of the G7. Of course, the best plans are usually out of control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong supportive roles of Lafont as Mother and Osterman as narrow brothers of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes where Charlotte should first seduce her, then rebel the family. French farce with English.
