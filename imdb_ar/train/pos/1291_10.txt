This is a good movie. A fun thing about watching money at a great price, especially from the child's point of view, is being blown up. Take it for its own sake, a delightful little movie about a child's dream that has become a reality, and what a child might do with a million dollars. You do not like it, you do not see it. They make films for monitors, not people who have nothing better to do, then complain about their lives.
