The installation drama, written by William Mastrosimon based on his play, in which Farah Fawcett Marjorie, her car was attacked by rapist Joe (James Russo). She managed to escape but the police told her that there was nothing they could do. However, she realizes that Joe has got her purse and knows where she lives. When her colleagues Pat (Alfred Woodward) and Terry (Diana Scarwood) stop working, Joe visits her to finish what he started. After being insulted by Joe in various ways, she gets a chance to answer and imprison him. She is fully aware that she is in another position of "his speech against you" and that there has been no technical rape, and she has no intention of taking it lightly so that Pat and Terry will recognize what his intentions were. <br /> <br /> The film finally reaches a confrontation between its opponents. As they continue, Marjorie is so cruel that one has to wonder whether she is as backward as her adversary. Fawcett does a fairly reliable job, while Russo is really excellent, like a poor creeper who does his best to handle the situation. With only two characters on the screen at most run-time, the film has an intimate character that suggests it will work better on stage. Director Robert M. Young of the most abject and exploiting elements in the situation; the film has become uncomfortable to watch at times. By the time Marjorie has the upper hand, things are changing enough that it is no longer easy to encourage her to go to the blood, and one hopes to make her see why. <br /> <br /> "I felt that extremism" was a good film that at least maintained interest and a high level of intensity. Edward and Scarwood are well in support (Scarwid has a great moment where Terry reveals herself to be a rape victim), the pace is fixed. Granted, the dialog box is not always very sharp, but the article is compelling every step of the way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
