Very good in the West. This was the first time that writer Richard Wilson directed a film, and this was also the first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as producer. It is a pleasure to see a very small and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a salon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to this town, which is controlled by outlaws and is appointed as the town's leader, but people worry that he will go too far, and also about the damage he will do to the town's business. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock", which was made in 1959. Keeps this film at a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge of the abyss.
