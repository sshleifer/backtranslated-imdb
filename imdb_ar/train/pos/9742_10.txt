This outstanding independent Argentine film is one of the best 2000 films from across South America, including Argentina, which has produced a stunning number of high quality films since 1999. In 2000 alone, Argentina released several high-quality films, which replaced Movie Argentine BO Records. Has been highly acclaimed by six dozen such exhibitions at major international film festivals. After watching this film, one can see how local Argentine films managed to recover last year 20% of the national film market. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of the best directors in Argentina, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization around the world, but emphasizes its impact on Argentina, especially the Jewish community in Buenos Aires. Daniel Hindler is a wonderful Jewish boy, trying to survive and succeed in today's business climate. Hector Altirio, one of the greatest actors in Spanish cinema around the world, is as perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, as in the rest of the cast, which includes stars Espana and Italy. <br /> <br /> Many of the current topics in western urban communities are explored, and I do not have enough space to go into detail. Daniel Burman cleverly woven them into the plot with different characters embodying various dilemmas. If this movie plays in a festival near you, or on a video, do not miss it!
