Given the adverse circumstances of 2009, where our reality is black president, this film has a strong historical significance. As for the value of entertainment, I found this film attractive and hateful. I was very impressed by the flagrant racism of the time, but I found music and dance incredibly. It is also wonderful to see Sami Davis Junior as a very small representative. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy being consoled by his Mami. He was told "why someday you can be president." This was so ironic in 1933 that he ridiculed him and thought he was charming, charming and funny. The bulk of the film is a fictional series of what the government would be if run by a black man. They portray government seats as the Church of the Baptist Revival. <br /> <br /> The truth was when I stumbled upon this film one day, it caught me. He really did a good job and was very fun. I think if we can look beyond racism, we can see this film because it brings us. In fact, realizing that it's not only ridiculous to have a black head, but it's normal, just makes this movie more important. Clearly represents a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
