I must say that I loved the film perfectly. The moments were funny, some intimate parts, just everywhere good. Personally I really liked the film because it's something I can finally relate to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more directed towards gay youth. It shows how a young boy like me will be treated as he grows up. All the more surprising, the strengthening of names, lack of knowledge is something I will always remember, like most young boys of the female, and now finally a film shows how difficult gay. So, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. You may not really have to watch it until a person is big and mature enough to understand
