A wonderful and free film often flows and is often lyricist, always smiling, smiling even if there are truly horrific accidents along the way. He's groping at the way women are treated, yet they seem to be going through very well, and it's all due to the fact that many potentially catastrophic scenes work very well. Perhaps this is the best performance for Depardieu, and certainly the most natural performer. Jean Murrow performs prominently in what should be a very difficult role, including strong sex scenes with a couple of men at least half her age. Miou-Miou is beautiful all around and has again very difficult sights to play. At first, this hateful / hateful hatred of women seems ugly and dirty, but with the appearance of the story and the characters appear a more tender and honest image. In the end, this uncompromising and daring film requires respect.
