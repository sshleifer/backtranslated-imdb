I saw this movie only once, on TV, and it was not repeated. This is strange when you think of garbage that is repeated over and over again. Horror movies are often a source of entertainment, but this film has really scared me. <br /> <br /> Do not read the next part if you have seen the movie after <br /> <br /> The most horrifying thing is when people are chasing the city where their wife is almost dead (they poisoned her). Who the hell are you asking? One by one they give their real identities. The girl who pretended to be deaf to spoil and seduce her said, "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve."
