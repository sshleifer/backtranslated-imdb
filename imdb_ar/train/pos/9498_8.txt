"The painting you see, then you remember better than I saw." So says Dick Helder (Ronald Coleman), the painter in The Light That Failed. (Who also participated in the tournament with Coleman in the convicted), and the strong performance of the great actor Walter Houston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the film largely give the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He has been blinded by the unloading of hazelnut powder while he and the childhood lover of Macy (Moriel Angelos) are playing with a gun. Later wound during fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his uncle. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by his ambition, and does not reach his fullest potential until the point he leaves. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lubinu), the destruction itself is set in motion. Lupino is very strong in this role and Coleman plays well. She has a nasty sarcasm that reminds me of the House of Davis in Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Good behavior and well directed, this is one of my favorite Coleman melodrama.
