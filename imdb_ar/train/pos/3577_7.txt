It is possible that this film was never seen on the radar screen, but it got a great deal of quality. It's fairly vibrant, yet you think, "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close depict ordinary people, and will never realize that they are now big-name actors. The thrill in this story seems so old that it does not chase Eugene's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the child will travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think that is possible. You may think that family problems in this film will never happen in your family, but I think that's possible. I remember Glen Claus saying something like "You think the work you're doing is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
