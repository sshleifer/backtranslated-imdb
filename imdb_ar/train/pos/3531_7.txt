Robert Siodmak does a great job with B noir from Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. He did so, perhaps added, without the great help of his male representatives, ie Curtis and Ton. She Raines along the way, a beautiful and long actress never reached for one reason or another to put some of her peers "Noir". <br /> <br /> Using Siodmak for sex, light, shadows and music is really wonderful because it handles this type. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexy drum by Elisha Cook, which was animated by enthusiastic Raines. It is this scene that brings "Lady Phantom" to a new land. <br /> <br /> Cydmac's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines, who performs a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man. Francis Toon called the phone. Alan Curtis does not seem angry that he may die and does not seem happy because he lived. And never, except for a brief moment in prison, was in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about many of these films is that with the advent of World War II, the interest in psychiatry deepened. But terms are often used incorrectly in films such as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth." The tone of "paranoia" is called Thomas Gomez - perhaps the tone of some disturbance associated with his turbulence, but he seems closer to mentally unstable. In fact, as evidenced by the rift, he may have a brain tumor that drives his mind. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady does not have the biggest plot, but it's worth seeing.
