First, let's start with negative points: 1) There are a huge number of gaps in the story line and questions that are asked and will not get anywhere near the answer; 2) The film is not for all people. <br /> <br /> The second point above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older theater type (like the theater you went to), you can hear the pulley pass through the projector sometimes. I loved that. It does not keep you busy with music or effects: it lets you think about what's going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates a wonderful and very enjoyable atmosphere. The same kind of atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to movie lovers, because cinematic work is great. Those who build their appreciation for a movie just on the story will completely disappoint them. It is the kind of story that you must form in your mind after that. (My novel is very beautiful, but probably far from the track!). If you go to watch the movie, there is a very cool part: when the two policemen talk to each other on their mobile phones. The effect of a very cool sound really sets you up right now. Hats for the person who thought of doing so.
