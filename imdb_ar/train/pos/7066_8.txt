This film is very old and I never realized what Ray Milland looked like in 1936. I remember he was playing in a wonderful film, Lost Weekend. Ray plays the role of Michael Stewart, a very wealthy banker. Three girls in this picture are very dissatisfied with their father's separation from their mother and discover that their father will marry a blond little girl who is a gold digger looking for a sugar-rich papa. They rent a man to make him a very rich count, named Count Arzsted (Misha Oyer), who was drunk all the time and is bankrupt and gives a lot of comic laugh throughout the picture. Diana Durbin (Benny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the police chief that she was the opera star and then Benny began to sing with a wonderful soprano voice that all of them heard about, the police department was full and the convicts began to applaud. this movie. This is the first appearance of Deanna Durbin and became an instant success during the night and continued to become a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
