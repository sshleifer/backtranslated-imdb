I saw this movie only once before, about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it's better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than a horror. He had this wonderful level of passion and great characterization that goes through him. I thought that Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. Unfortunately she did nothing else because she was an absolutely excellent actress. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was just as perfect as the message, especially when she realized that, despite Mark's death, she knew it was fine. <br /> <br /> Many scenes have made me jump (which is rare for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, and the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the strange radio in the background and a few legs ripped apart and collapsed on the dust. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent and very moving film.
