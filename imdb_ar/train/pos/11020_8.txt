This film is an exciting, visually exciting and exciting picture with lots of dark humor. This was one of the biggest songs of 1993. This is one of the best Harlin movies. Lithgow is a wonderful entertaining villain. Stallone certainly achieved a short return from this thriller. This is probably Harlan's best work as a film director. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp optical reflector (2.35: 1) and a superb surround sound with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. The DVD has a comment track running by the director with Stallone comments. The DVD also comments the crew as well.
