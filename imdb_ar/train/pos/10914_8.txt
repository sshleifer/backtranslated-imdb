I've seen the wonderful Thin Man-Powell and Loy series, but there's something wonderful about chemistry, Powell and Arthur at this click. Jean Arthur shines when you look at Powell. There is a hidden clamor that is not without tension between them. This movie may not be cleverly enjoyed by the Thin Man series, but no doubt it compensates for its charm. While I was watching, I certainly thought Powell had an affair with Arthur. My friends think the same thing. It's one film I wish I'd go back to (look at schmooze and lock lips with Powell!) There seems to be no end to his sweet, hilarious smell! Powell's personality, Lawrence Bradford, may be the closest to the "perfect man". Well, this is a very great way, but I can not help myself.
