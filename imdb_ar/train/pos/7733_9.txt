The quality of Foley Noir in this saturated and condensed pulp film seems perfectly appropriate. Shot, edited or edited to reveal himself about a troubled boxer who discovers his or her own purpose (or absence). Other comments may indicate a lack of interest in the heart, but I personally think this is a great piece of film!
