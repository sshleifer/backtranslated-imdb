Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Sure, watching it in 2008 is different from watching it in 1986. At first, I did not think I would make it in the film. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so repulsive, respectful and disrespectful that I found it hard to see him. He embodied all the negative stereotypes of Americans. If that is not bad enough, once the finest American city workers are introduced, the picture gets worse. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese presented themselves as autistic emotional addicts. The film was not funny, but I was suspended there because of its nostalgic value. I'm glad I kept watching. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, judges are influenced by the way the tour ends. This film went from about three to seven its class because of the end. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious end and this was just that. It was great to keep the city working there and to keep the factory, but what distinguishes it is the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a modest film that ended with a big win.
