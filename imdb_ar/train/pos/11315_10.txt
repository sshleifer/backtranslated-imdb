Luchino Visconti was years ahead of his contemporaries. Italy's top directors in the 1940s and 1950s were men who understood the medium, but Luciano Visconti, the visionary, dared to bring a film like showing what he could do. His genius is evident early in his career with "Ossessione," a film from James Caine's The Postman Always Ring Twice, which is later produced by Hollywood, but this version is dwarfed by what Visconti achieved in the film. Luchino included Visconti and his collaborators on the unapproved Alberto Moravia screen, a man who knew the impact of passion on humans. <br /> <br /> The movie has been well preserved in the DVD format we've seen recently. The film is a necessity for all serious movie lovers because we can see how Visconti's vision translates the text into a film that really resonates in a reasonable way, something the American version lacks. <br /> <br /> What happens by watching a movie is the intensity that the director gets from his main players. The wonderful Clara Calamay does a great job like Giovanna, the woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is get rid of the gentle man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms. Kalamay's achievements in Italian cinema. The latest series of the film shows Ms. Kalamay at her best in a ridiculous development that serves as a moral deliverance of the brutal crime committed. <br /> <br /> Massimo Gerotti, one of the best actors of his generation, who appears as Geno, is just as great as the man who awakens the passion of Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, which Mr. Giroti drives with such ease and sophistication as never before on the screen. Mr. Girotti makes a man come alive in performance that sounds very easy, but with another actor he may not be very clear. Juan Delanda is seen as Giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his characters seem more truthful than his counterpart in the American film, where he is seen as more than a clown. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully filmed by Dominique Scala and Aldo Tunti. They gave the film a natural look that was the way Italian directors of the time favored it. The original musical score for Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved the opera and was one of the best directors, also includes Arias from Bizet and Verdi who fit well in the film context. <br /> <br /> "Ossession" is a movie we cherish because we see Luciano Visconti great at the top of his form.
