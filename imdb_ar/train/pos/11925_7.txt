This film came across the cable one afternoon. I have to admit that I was not an adult baseball fan, but sometimes I can get into a good movie about sports. What I found more interesting was the portrayal of the foster family system. As a healer, both health and other mental health and community care have been seen in society, although it is refreshing to see a film that has shown ups and downs in this system: people who jump from one family to another, and biologically, parents are not always actively involved, and transitions that can be Just heart pain and heart melts. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Danny Glover are the announcers of this film, both of which are very reliable. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding tears at the end of the film.
