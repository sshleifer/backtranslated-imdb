I saw my family Arthur Bach stumbling and stumbling since the film first appeared. We have most saved fonts. I saw that two weeks ago and I still feel tickled in the simple humor and vision of life portrayed by Dudley Moore. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side kick - although I'm not one of her biggest fans. This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fianc√©e's home. Talking with the servants and Susan's father is spitting sideways. The line from the personal server, "Would you like to wait in the library" followed by Arthur's reply, "Yes I like, the bathroom is out of the question", is NOTICE NEWMAIL on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny stuff "!
