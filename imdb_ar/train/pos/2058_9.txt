This film is an interesting film about the type of deadly scarecrow - it is surprising that it can rise to become larger than the sum of its parts. The intermediate montage scenes and 30-somethings play teenagers and some excellent facial expressions to become one of the "new wave" of modern classics. As I watched, I came out of the film with the same feeling of "shock and horror" as I saw the movie "The Godfather" for the first time in 1969. The stunning Tiffany Gardner photograph of my morally bankrupt body was worthy of being nominated for Grammy, which was well documented robbed by Ricky Martin and the hips restless. Unfortunately, none of the sequences can live up to the original expectation (unlike the godfather series that improved with each boost and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
