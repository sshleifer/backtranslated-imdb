This independent film was one of the best films at the long film festival I saw there. I liked it. There were many things that were wonderful about the film. Moreover, I had the opportunity for the crew and crew to meet a tremendous amount. I thought that Avi did a great job in his role. Ricky Ullman was quite right for his role as a Disney actor. He was amazed by his talent to be able to move from a young teen comedy to an adult role with no problems. The film's talent was absolutely amazing because cinematography was so wonderful you wanted to see an independent film, He really should see him. I think Mr. Grover would be very proud to make such a presentation at his festival and that his parents loved the film a lot when he won the favorite audience award they went to and I saw it again. This was really a great film that was dark, funny, sad and truly emotional. I'm really very excited about this film and I do not want to spoil it for anyone and just really amazed it, I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go to places and I hope to see them work more of them in the future.
