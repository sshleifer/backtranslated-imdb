This is a comedy of morality, so sometimes a bitter touch of bitterness occurs, but lightness relieves all irony and paradoxical flows until one sudden moment will stop your heart and change everything. <br /> <br />, written and beautifully directed, is a fully sparkling gem, with beautiful representation by everyone. Jean-Louis Trentigant is fabulous as usual, and Raymond Schneider is a pearl, perfect and glowing, not to be missed. Really wonderful movie !!
