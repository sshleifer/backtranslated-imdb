Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thriller movies of 2005. A great plot. Great development. Great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films, apart from "Scream" and "A Nightmare at Elm Street". This can be the best. This plot is one of the best things in the film and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) is a struggling hotel manager, and climbs up to the Red Eye late to Los Angeles. You do not know that it was followed by Jackson Rappner (Murphy). They have two drinks and end up sitting together on board. Later she reveals to her that the assassin was sent to kill the Internal Security Company who is staying at the Lisa Hotel. What does this have to do with Lisa? Well, she had to move his room to the upper wing so they could bomb him, if Rivner did not kill her father (Brian Cox). The development of the story and its introduction really gives you more zing and the side characters and side jokes really add to it. Overall, definitely one of the best thriller movies of 2005. Definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 4 stars
