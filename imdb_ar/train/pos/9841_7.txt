I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with "real" actors and landscapes can not - although the effects of the computer are changing more and more. They can push the spelling boundaries ("the Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), the scene ("Aladdin"), or reality ("The Story of the Game"). There are some good examples of this in the "ice age", such as when we see a herd of extinct mammals now migrating across the countryside, talking like old friends. Such scenes I am happy to see, where we feel familiar and strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although Ice Age is not as good as the best animated movie of all time, it's a really fun movie. Relax, enjoy the intended historical monuments, beautiful backdrops and laughter. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred the angry Mammoth, Mr., the lazy laziness, and Diego, a silent tiger, while taking a baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. In the way, of course, they have a lot of problems. It also appeared throughout the Scrat trip, which is the most unfortunate rodent in history, which desperately tries to bury the corpse for the winter: in the glaciers, at the top of the dead trees, in the icy caves. His opening scene is classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some personal building moments thrown out, but some scenes, like changing nappy or dodo, are hilarious, pets are good looking. There is a very moving moment too, when the cave paintings of the Mammoth appear in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> It's not something to watch, but it's good for an enjoyable hour or so. <br /> 7/10
