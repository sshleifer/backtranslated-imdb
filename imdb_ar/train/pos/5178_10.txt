Before Tuscan Sky, I saw the performance of Dian Lin tender in the movie Lark. The camp is invited to their youth camp and experienced as adults. It seems that everyone who comes back looking for something has lost it, making it very realistic. Maybe you had to be a cart to really get it, but to quote one character I noticed that all her clothes were wet "This is a very good camp!" From practical jokes and fighting to their friends, to the dreadful lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it's great. Once the exciting activities are now seen as mundane. The cast casts the best two-dimensional roles and makes them certified. Bill Baxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Ms. Brad Paisley (perhaps when she first fell for her!) Beautiful scenery, bright colors and comedic music (including Halo Moda versions) and the comic adaptation of the famous director Sam Remy makes this movie you can drag again and again like search About an old friend.
