*** You may not think of this spoiler, but I prefer to be careful of neglect *** I have never seen this movie when I was young. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it again and again. <br /> <br /> For the little Elaine Woods in her life, she was a wonderful voice for Sindrella; very attractive; very reasonable. The music really fit the film perfectly. The acting was fantastic. I love rats !! You really "hated" Mrs. Tremin and sisters sisters; they were just awful. Cartoonists portray well-behaved behavior. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, especially if you're in love stories. I have seen my daughter about 25 times and I'm still excited.
