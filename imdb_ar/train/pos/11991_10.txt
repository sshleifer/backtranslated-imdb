Ah, Talespin! What can I say that has not already been said about this wonderful show? nothing! This is by far one of the most well written programs I've ever encountered, direct work or animation. The newer things are too immersive for my taste, and some "mature" things I have to get rid of. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are very attractive and reasonable. Some of them can stretch up to an hour or two for a movie. The episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very exciting while still enjoyable for children and adults alike. Then there are pure comedy episodes like Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck, where the focus is on fun. I can laugh at some tears myself in some of the options chosen. <br /> <br /> The appearance of drama is largely lacking in most of today's performances (at least those not specifically targeted), especially in cartoons. In the "Stormy Weather" episode, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides he will join Joe's circus, but Palo thinks it will be very dangerous. In the biggest battle in this episode, Baloo screams in Kit to get away from Daring Dan, whose scream kit is "No! You can not tell me what to do! And bury his face in his pillow. The next day he leaves to circus the air. This kind of drama is rare in a caricature, and we would be very welcome in those created at present. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth. Baloo is pretty much the way it is in The Jungle Book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a shrewd businesswomen who rarely have her ideas about getting good money in practice. Molly is a nice little girl, but you can not let this fool you. It can be real hell sometimes. Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. He does not trust adults much to his liking, and he has a tendency to cut ties. He saw his expression in looting and lightning when he grabbed the hook of wrestling: it seemed as if he was ready to put it right through the pirates. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is the drama associated with the very real chemistry among the characters that make this exhibition number 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well illustrated in All's Whale That End Whale when Baloo takes Kit's word because Seymour misuses animals in his aquarium rather than standing up with other adults. The relationship between Palo and Piki is also realistic, since Palo's motivation for action comes from wanting to buy ol 'Sea Duck, not necessarily wanting to help Rebecca. But there is something to tell me that if he regains the duck, he will still work in Rebecca. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other aircraft in the series, is designed in real life. The functions of the aircraft do not change once during the serial (such continuity is also difficult to access). Unlike most other superlatives of other cartoons, there is no single weapon on board (unless you return the mango!), Rather than That's the skill of a great pilot skilled at getting out of trouble. Hard to think of a hero car does not contain a type of gun tower or laser gun or even a pistol somewhere on board. The fact that they use their heads to get rid of problems is hard to find in a cartoon these days. Plus it's just a fantastic design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon movie. Start. interval. Definitely worth all ten stars!
