I did not expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised, because it was light, funny and very well noted. The central trio of deadly motorcyclists was surprisingly popular as they stumbled and landed during their drug-centered trip to Wales. The humor was nice and wonderful, as were the three characters (witness sympathy with the shopkeeper of the little old lady). The countryside was completely captured in Wales, and the soundtrack was well chosen. It was written intelligently and carefully, with great attention to detail - I did not see such a realistic picture of alternative culture - I felt I was with them. Very light in a fun-filled touch - not what you might expect from a movie about drivers and drugs. A joy on all fronts, and difficult to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall, the unexpected treasure of the film.
