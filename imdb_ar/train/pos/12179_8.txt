I happened to see this movie by chance a few days ago while the channels were flipping. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting film. In "A Guy Thing," Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle colleague, who is about to marry his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) and settle in a non-challenging middle-class life. We first meet Paul at the bachelor party, where he does not want to engage in any of the normal bachelor party activities his colleagues (surprisingly few) encourage, if he is a bit chakya and has a lot of feelings with his friends soon and the conflict. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is that the next morning of the night he sleeps with a naked dancer around him, and phones his mother-in-law to tell him that Karen is on her way. Oh, the dancer around the halo is the cousin of Karen Becky (Julia Steeles). <br /> <br /> From this small, harmful atmosphere of potential problems, the Great Oak grows out of frenzied misfortune, while Paul destroys misfortune to adventure, and tries to cover up what he did while keeping up with his appearance as a good and always family-oriented man, Very excited about their next marriage. His efforts to ensure that Karen is still wiser about any possible error on his part, which ridicules Paul closer and closer to the fun-loving Becky, forcing him to wonder whether he really wants the life that seems to have been assigned to him. . The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth seeing.
