I found this movie to be a magician. I thought the characters had evolved since I saw, and I found myself caring for these people. This is a piece of time that I think happened during the Depression. The single mother, known as the city stripping (has a reason to be), puts an ad in the "spouse" paper. Christopher Reeve plays former city players looking for work. He sees the ad and goes out to see it. She rents it. I had a few laughs as their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their place. Everything went well. He needs to work so he does not want to bother her. She needs his help, but she does not want to get the upper hand. They dance about the fact that they start to need each other. Things start to warm up ... ... big bang. I will not spoil this by telling you what is happening. But the goal of the decision is absolutely wonderful. I found that the story is very reasonable at the time it occurs. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories out there. The younger generation may not get it, but if you're over 40, I think you'll love it. If you like Christopher Reeve in "somewhere in time" you'll like this place too.
