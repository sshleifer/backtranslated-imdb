This is a unique and bold film. It's lively, with highly sophisticated characters. Offers very good. <br /> <br /> I love managers who do not fear asking the public to think ... <br /> <br /> Brett Carr dares to look inside and ask questions and drill under the surface. By virtue of the nature of the film, it practically requires that the viewer be seen internally as well. It may take some courage to do so. I can see how some people can find it very closely. However, I found it interesting, much more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original film director with a vision. I am curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Watch it.
