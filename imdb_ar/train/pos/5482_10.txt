This is an amazing film. In addition to showing real footage of the main events of the failed coup d'Ã©tat to overthrow Chavez, we present a background picture of a divided society. It seems that many wealthy people have a choice with the democratic people's choice, and are willing to use the army to change the system. "Be careful what you say before your servants" Cash comment. The president of the country's largest oil company appoints a new president, with the support of the United States, and young Irish filmmakers portray the camera. A wonderful film to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documents on how to deal with the media, the use of force, for the benefit of big companies, against the interests of the democratic desires of the people. Installation stuff.
