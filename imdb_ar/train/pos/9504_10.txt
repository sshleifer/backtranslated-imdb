As many people know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican Cinema, fortunately during the late 1990s and early 21st century, great films such as La Lili de Herodis, Pago California, Amoris Perros and Yue Tu appeared in Mamá También, and of course El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba. El Coronel ... is a wonderful film that recounts the classic story of Gabrielle Garcia Marquez by eliminating the elements of magical realism and replacing it with the raw reality that lives in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel, who are waiting for their pensions, but with more than half the population Mexico, living in absolute poverty. The characters of the film are classic characters in Mexican society, such as the national colonel, the cold and ambitious priest, the hypocrites, but at the same time, the faithful child, the tolerant and sick wife, the hidden homosexuality, etc. Movie, is a must to see if you want to learn more about Mexican society, especially, if you want to watch a wonderful movie, by one of the best filmmakers in Mexico
