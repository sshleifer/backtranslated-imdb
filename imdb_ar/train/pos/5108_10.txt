This is my favorite movie all the time. I used to have my movie Friday night with pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this film for the first time with my aunt Brand and Sister Chasity. I was in second grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sisi was my new best friend. I have read a lot of comments about why Bud Sissy left and how Sissy should "learn to act". But let's go back and look at this for one second: SPOILER - my interpretation of the film now, not when I was eight years old. Bud & Sissy's relationship turns out to be the worst because she cheats on Gili in the bull ride. They get into a huge battle. Bugs tries to get Sissy angry by asking Pam to dance. Then Cissie thinks the two mistakes will really come true and asks her whether she needs "any help." They are all in the dance hall acting like fools when Bud asks about Pam, "When will you take me home and rape me?" "When you're ready for cowboys," says Pam. Bud then goes home with Pam to her home in downtown Houston. Which he bought for him with his oil money and "all this means." Bud is the one who cheats in Sisi. Sissi waits for Brod when he returns home the next day. Sisi is the person who leaves the buds. Then, it's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and wins out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my explanation. Everyone I have is sure! I like this film. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I got a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
