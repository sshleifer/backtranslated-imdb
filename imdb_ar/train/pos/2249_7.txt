I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a very positive and true picture of the LDS faith. I think rephrasing this epic journey across the plains will be useful, because many people today do not know the experiences and persecution of the early Mormon Church. It is an amazing story of strong and dedicated people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the most disturbing part of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me a great deal) was the filming of Brigham Young as one who was "deceived" by church members deliberately believing that he had been summoned To be the successor of Joseph Kalnabi. Although I understand the tragic causes of this line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are a historical fact, while Brigham and many members of the church understood and firmly believed that he had been summoned to lead a church. Brigham was not deceived by the knowledge of saints. Instead he led them confidently with inspiration. This point is important to Mormons because it depends on an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks of the prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspiring prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you like this statement, I just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham thinks himself.
