The film, recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is inspiring and moving. A famous leader, forced to retire by illness, returns to a small village from his birth to become the choir leader, and finally found in his death music. Drawing on the Swedish features of preserving things within the self and the isolated nature of a small Swedish village, this film develops all its characters well. She was beautifully directed, acted and sang, brought tears to many eyes, and smiles to all. Hope you find the distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, look for him!
