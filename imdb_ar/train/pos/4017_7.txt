This is a very memorable Western spaghetti. She has a wonderful story, interesting characters, some very good acting, especially from Nerala Rosalba. Her role as a wicked villain in this film is really classic. She steals every scene in her, and expresses her face and eyes so much, even when she does not speak. Its performance is very reasonable. I've managed to be quite charming without being superior to the top (there's no mistake in being above the top). Mark Damon is amazingly good in this film as well. <br /> <br /> The music score is excellent, and the song is the type that will be played continuously in your head for several days after watching the movie, whether you like it or not. There are a few parts that are very entertaining. I particularly like the part where Rosalba Neri takes off in front of the parrot. There are also lots of amazing gun games that were well done. <br /> <br /> Maybe I will give this movie 8 or 9 stars if it is not for two. The first is a silly bar room brawl that happens about 25 minutes in the film. This is one of the most ridiculous battles I've ever seen in a movie. It is very badly designed and looks more like a dance of bad musical than any kind of real battle. You might be able to overlook this if it's a comedy Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but it's a more dangerous Western film, and the fight needs to be more realistic. The other thing that bothered me about this film was his cowardly Mexican girlfriend in Yuma. I think it was supposed to be a relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and it was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Toko when you need it? <br /> <br /> Everything that has been said, let me assure everyone who read this that Johnny Day is a classic Western macaroni despite the flaws I mentioned, and all lovers of this genre need to watch this movie.
