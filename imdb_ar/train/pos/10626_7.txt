This is a decent little flick in Michigan, about a man who was haunted by his past, with his abusive father's husband (Gunnar Hansen) and a large uneducated well. In fact, it's very crazy, but it does try to be very clear. He also got a footnote, his little devil and his angel. Satan does not say one word, but he does not have to, Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel is wheeled in this, as Eric is busy with things that make him feel better, like "liberating" people who decide what they need, mostly beautiful girls. This is a decent picture of madness, and you're someone for you at some point to see what's going on, but overall, I watched this from beginning to end focusing on the film because it certainly retained my interest. It's a little lacking in some areas, but nothing I can really put my finger on it. A good effort is worth seeing if you love intrusive clicks.
