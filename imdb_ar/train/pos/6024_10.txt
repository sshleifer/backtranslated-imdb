I saw ZP when it was first released and I found it very disappointed. It looked like a forced text and arch and highly fake '60s. It's a very advance and ridiculous policy. And let's face it, you're still under the weight of a love known as BLOWUP: and still do not bother her completely. Now "love" is twisted with all the nostalgia you provoke, okay. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time and time marches were nice with ZP and time was a teacher to me. I visit this movie almost every ten years and improve with age. The ZP is its own "experience" and is only related to BLOWUP through its creator, the great master Antonioni, the great late, <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, it was good to see the pristine at all printed in the right size (Enormous), restored by an Italian cultural agency known for good art work when they see it and know the importance of maintaining such beauty in good condition. To this day I remember the moments that emerged from the audience when the first shot of the Valley of Death appeared. It was like thousands of visual shocks Anthony had deliberately set to bring us to a new level of awareness. Indeed the following from this point is a completely different kind of "place". <br /> <br /> What is surprising to me is how this film appears on its own. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time I saw them --- in the early 1980s - I began to feel affection for the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. While these two people seemed to be the smart shadow version of Olivia and Zephreyle Leonifer (read: Romeo and Juliet), they were busy now - especially the girl in her passive insistence. It took its time. . . To live. Everything, everything dies around. <br /> <br /> On stage, the reality light actually erases the new "fun" that has been found. I guessed that the power of Anthony's vision had already worked inside me. "Over time, the 1980s responded with" "Uh-Huh" and I cherished my love secretly, majestically and jealously. <br /> <br /> But, that is what good art means inside you. And if you want to be her way and "love" you again: And you will get a "change." <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies decided to show ZP in the March lineup, and ZP must be seen on a giant screen so that That really takes you to the built environment But, hey, even sometimes, the profile of the beloved was not in the image of a newspaper better than not taking a look at all. <br /> <br /> Today, the ZP was withdrawn in a mysterious way and was replaced by a stranger from Allisis Restaurant. < br> <br /> <br /> So, it is still very "difficult", "very worrying" and "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe so, as with all good works of art, where He lives everything that dies around him. <br /> <br /> Peace.
