This is not a bad film. This is not very funny, but it is interesting and fun. Have a few funny moments. Cher performs well <br /> <br /> in a role that completely contradicts her real life. Their performance <br /> <br /> alone is worth seeing. If this movie has been shown <br /> <br /> today it will not be nominated, but by the standards of the 1980s, <br /> <br /> was excellent.
