The title of the film is somewhat exaggerated, which may lead to some unrealistic expectations. Frankly, there is very little "street panic" that can be seen here. In fact, very few people in the film know that there is a killer on the specialist may spread the plague to everyone and anyone who encounters him. Having said that, what we have here is a very good story with a level of suspense that starts anyway reasonably (because, unlike people "on the streets", the viewer knows what is going on) and this director Elia Kazan builds up very deliberately. When looking for a plague victim, one of the most interesting side-effects of the growing relationship between Dr. Reid (Richard Widmark) and police captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two do not like each other, although they must work together. In the end, they have established a true bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job though. <br /> <br /> All of the shows were great to a great extent. Both Widmark and Douglas were wonderful, and I was very impressed with Jack Palance's very early look and playing his "heavy" role model. I found very little to criticize here. Barbara Bill Gedis may have encountered a small apartment like Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not central to the story. All in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10
