The acting in this film was wonderful. As amateur fugitives, I found very few errors. As a human, I touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you may think they are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, did not leave anything to her performance. Young actors playing Rocket Boys showed a talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired the love / eternal hatred between father and son so that it felt real. If you do not get a lump in your throat or hear tears when this first successful rocket rises or when the father and son check the conditions, check your pulse (maybe dead).
