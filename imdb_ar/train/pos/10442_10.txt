This is really one of the best movies about love I've ever seen. Directly followed by "No Sunset", which is technically not another film at all, as it revolves around the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is a "love" in the real world. Well, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the prospects in the film. When reading other reviews, it's a pleasure to know how many other crazy people on dialogue-based movies also. This is what makes "before sunrise" very good. The dialogue is perfect. It's very real, very attractive and funny. It is not surprising that Jesse and Celine fall in love, because you will fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the cafe, where they pretend to be their best friends, while pretending to be their best friend. she's perfect. Brings you back to the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, you should watch "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before the Sunset." If you are like me, you see the movie "Sunset" first, it's hard to get rid of the feeling of pity And grief over the little lovers throughout the entire show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the greatest romantic film in my books is great acting, excellent script, and beautiful sites.
