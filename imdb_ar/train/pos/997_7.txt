I have to agree with most other jobs. Was it a comedy? drama? For me, he leaned slightly toward the comedian side. I could have been a great film without comedy and was fascinated by horror. Jimmy continues to escape to Julio and his name. In New York, how often do you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how Robert Pasteurley could dig the Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Again, comedy or drama? But it was still a special amusing Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberley Elise, and she is certainly a beautiful actress and she seems to take her craftmanship. She is a young actress who will be viable.
