Although I love Kurt Fonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I did not know that. The only reason I saw Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I saw "Hero Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was wonderful, but the plot was. There were relatively few political conspiracies and more emphasis on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio comments with hidden US secret messages, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turned out, Americans) toward the Jews or Hitler. What carries greater weight, or service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is more obvious because these words are not spoken at all, not even narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learns to hide his feelings completely so that he does not open up, even in his memoirs. It is almost impossible to portray the internal conflict of this character - but with the help of representation and excellent photography, this film is run by him. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as humor or cynical use of romantic cliches (such as the White Christmas song), which make them different from regular American films. I recommend it to anyone who is bored of Hollywood spy films.
