This is not a technical film, it's a major entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful people are effective and working. I found it very entertaining. It's not supposed to be an intellectual catalyst, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chase are very funny and just a sauces. Definitely worth the lease. <br /> <br /> So, in short, I recommend checking out Friday night entertainment with your boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it!) <br /> <br /> The bad guys are also good. Fini, a great Korean, the hereditary man of heroes. The bad guys are too bad.
