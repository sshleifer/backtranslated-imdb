The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was proceeding at an excellent pace, Peru's effects were accomplished brilliantly, and the story of the basic love triangle takes place and sheds the science fiction element into it. I can identify many of the characters and their rational logical motives within the story. <br /> <br /> The action of the camera was fantastic, the sound clear and precise, the background music that was perfectly selected for the effect, the firefighters singing, the unforgettable, talented, unbeatable anomalies, brilliantly crafted sets, and special effects performed with a skilled talent. <br /> <br /> I am perplexed about how a small carnival in a fully stocked lot can be powered by a single lamp outlet. This seems impossible at the very least. The battle between the brothers near the end of the film was fascinating. The presence of Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a very impressive touch as he played a semi-dangerous role in Carney's well.
