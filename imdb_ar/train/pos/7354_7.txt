I watched this movie for the first time in more than 25 years on British television and I could only see it again last week on a copy of a DVD purchased from ebay. I remember her musical sequence, color, and gorgeous wardrobe and her clothes, but the plot was weaker than the previous film Anna Nigel / Michael Wilding in Park Lane and Mimet did not stand well over the years. But Michael Wilding's joy in the film, the magician, funny, debonair, seems to be great fun at the top of his form. Worth watching him alone. Anna Nigel appears slightly beside him, and very old for her part, but by the late 1940s, their film partnership was entrenched with the advent of cinema for the public. Spring in Park Lane achieved the highest success in 1947 and was a big money maker. Wilding wrote in his autobiography at length his great appreciation for Herbert Wilcox, director and promoter of the London film series.
