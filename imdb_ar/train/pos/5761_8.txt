I swear that zombie was killed twice, and continued to return. We have been given this film 8. Let's face it, and this is exactly what other reviewers say, namely "Easy to Use Camera". Hey, hey, hey, welcome to making an indie macro movie. The fact that Todd Gates got over 700 zombies to appear in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, the story contains loopholes, yes, we see the same zombie over and over, but who really cares? Take it for its own sake, a fun and enjoyable horror film, share it with your buds, or explore people you really care about. O people, I suppose you all loved the rubbish blocks like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace, supporting the independent film industry!
