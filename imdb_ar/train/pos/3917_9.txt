I first saw this film when it was released in the United States in 1984. I've seen it a lot, many times since then. What surprises me in the film is the integration of the art of rehearsal into the lives of the characters and vice versa. During the film, the two intertwine and sometimes one is not sure whether the person is watching the characters' lives or a scene of rehearsal. This continues until the climax of the film. After all these years, I and my friends still love to discuss whether "Carmen" has been challenged or not. From the reactions of other characters, even murder in an upscale fashion, it is open to debate. Combining the passion for dance, the quality of acting, the love of art, and the brilliance of all performances to create a wonderful film, once again, Willow blends the line between life and art.
