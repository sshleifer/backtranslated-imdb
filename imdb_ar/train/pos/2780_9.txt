Wonderful movie, I loved it. Â· Large editing and sound usage. Embodies the true sense of Indian life, yet we can all communicate. He chose well cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so that you care about them all and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great and the trend really works as everyone starts naturally and naturally. You can only help access Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the tubular walk and body position of each of the leading ladies is very convincing as a person playing football.
