Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking Masterclass in acting / directing / filming / editing / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally released. I only saw it for the first time in two years, but it has fully survived the test of time, and I have seen it many times since then. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is wonderful, from the moving performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this film well, I still feel comfortable every time Voight flashes one of its patheticly painful appearances, or Hoffman coughs in his deadly and fateful way) to the stunning cinema and wonderful sequence of dreams. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to risk making visually interesting and audiovisual films like this one. Midnight cowboys must be required in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
