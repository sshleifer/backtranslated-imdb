Like many here arose with Scooby Doo. Unlike many who have done here, I love this show! I think it has been done very well and think through. Everything about it is portrayed as accidental does not mean to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with one bad guy trying to get better than a good guy. Using the well-known characters of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it is much easier to attract the audience with a sarcastic humor from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There were always side-shows from Scooby-Doo that bothered the fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts of the 1980s. These separate elements were in place: they allowed the sale of new content, the creation of new fans and the retention of Scooby-Doo goods on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get an idea!" Is not suited to this traditional role, but perhaps what I always wanted to be shorts is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy: a full-featured theatrical show focusing on the best / favorite characters of Scooby-Doo! Good features for viewing: animation, sounds, attention to detail, villains, relationship "best friend" between Shaggy and Scooby Doo, persistent humor! Bad features: None, although the refurbished mystery machine is very close sometimes. <br /> <br /> Warner Bros. Animation One of the most intelligent cartoons in a long time!
