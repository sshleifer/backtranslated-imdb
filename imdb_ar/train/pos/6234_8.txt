This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between the two is very nice, funny and very intelligent. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; as if I put all my eggs in one basket and let us face music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the film that gave me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose that he will always occupy a special place in my heart (sorry for passionate, but I'm a woman, so) in all this film gets 8/10 of me. The choreography was fantastic, and the fact that the game of the game "Lucille Ball" makes it even more wonderful.
