Another wonderful taste of what should be the film super hero after Batman: Dead End, which only helps stimulate our taste buds and leaves us want more! This is what a real supernatural film should look like and feel like! So tough this is fanfilm of some kind. Attention to detail, personality and work is undoubtedly genuine. Although this production is limited in resources, it is ashamed to produce films of extraordinary dimensions with a large budget and stocked with stars. Here the main characters and supportive act and look like real-life people. Finally, Superman actually looks "cool" and looks like the real thing! Batman, in the way they should be, without rupturing body armor and rubber-coated bullets to hide hordes of paid actors that do not offer. I just hope that some reasonable implementation tools from Warner Bros. will give OK to produce a full modification of this gem. I do not care if it's about the theater or directly to the DVD, and I will not be too tired to watch it. Only the piece of land itself deserves the hard earned dough for this purpose. I hope that the "big characters" in the Marvel & DC productions will take a look and see how a super hero film will look well. No more failure "Batman & Robin", or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these young directors and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero of the film, just to make it a "bomb" in the theaters. Mr. Kolora ... we need more directors like you!
