This film is awesome for three main reasons. It's aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. There is a dark color feature throughout the film with extraordinary fashion and exquisite collections. Photography that seems very expensive (and probably not) complements the appearance. I always enjoy these stories about groups of good / lonely people who meet and become family. Sometimes the cliches fall in but this one does not. This group of actors represents well-flawed characters, but they are very beloved. Alan Larkin is the best (between him and the logo and theme film Road, I could not help but remember my favorite film last year "Miss Sunshine"?). I've discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, the impressive actor, and have been a bit perturbed by the performance of Til Schweiger at times. The opening scene, all scenes where they fail tricks very funny. There is a mixture of humor and passion throughout the film. I love the end very much. And of course everything about the magician's theme. The good magician makes the audience look at where he wants them, to create an illusion. What happens exactly is what the film director does and that's why they call it the magic of the film.
