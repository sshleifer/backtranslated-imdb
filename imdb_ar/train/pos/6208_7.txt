In 1997, Henry Lowe, the low-end comedy, was a safe choice for films that no one bothered to return to. Strolling walk (Thomas Jay Ryan) wandering around the city. His obsessed behavior and fantasies inspire him to collect obsessed garbage (James Orbaniac) to write poems, while Henry sincerely tries to drop the man's sister (Parker Bossi). As the poet digs, Henry refuses. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story. Harold and Maude's Ghost were supposed to quote higher than ever possibilities on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Parker Posey does not represent the semi-official Queen of the Indies for nothing. So when the writer / director Hal Hartley came up with a new rendition of his film, a film was born. Although we have joined the same characters for many years, they are in a completely different kind of dark comedy; this one is overcome by spyware! Perhaps Henry was an international spy - perhaps a double or even a triple agent - for years before interviewing others. He is either dead or in hiding from the agents and authorities of many countries. Everyone wants an incoherent magazine that may contain only coded secrets that can destabilize countries and economies. Fei Bossi is either the wife he left to leave, or his widow, depending on who tells the truth. Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or hotly contested magazines include a game of jumping from the world to successful and multinational people at every turn. She never knows who believes or trusts. Nor do we. <br /> <br /> As we sponsor these unlikely characters on the territory of Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan, Hartley's text retorts the ironic joke of his first appearance, avoiding a threatening distraction in exposing them to physical danger. His ridiculous wonders of paranoia, hypocrisy alliances and musical chairs of today's geography begin to collapse towards the end. However, first movie enthusiasts will be pleasantly surprised by the ways in which Hartley recycling methods. (5/18/07)
