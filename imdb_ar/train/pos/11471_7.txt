I'm a big fan of cinema and I watched this movie because I heard how interesting it is. I can honestly say it was really interesting. The two main actors are wonderful, the film is not boring at all, and the concept behind it (though clearly inspired by the murders in Columbine and the homicide films of the killers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really detract from the realism seen in the first hour or so, and the end does not really end at all. A shaky camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema, that's something. But I still think the film is very good and the director Ben Kucio deserves some credit.
