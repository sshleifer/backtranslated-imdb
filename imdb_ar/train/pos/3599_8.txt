This movie is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first three minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, and their motives are entirely believable. The dialog is new, which is very real. Unique positions for characters are not at all cliched or penetrated. So climax, that is. Then it seemed as if the movie went off a bit and got a little clap and was unreasonable. But I do not want to encourage people to watch this film. The first 3/4 of it is truly fantastic. 8. There are some great shows here. Check out this movie.
