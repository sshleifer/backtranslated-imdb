As a conversion to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much of my new religious history as possible. I was invited to attend a screening of this film with my children, young people and other young women as well as their families in our pavilion. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the historic church village located there. We had reservations at the visitor center to watch this movie. Since my film was limited to a few documentaries of the church, I was intrigued. The only "full-length animation" of the church I saw was "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were well written and well formed. <br /> <br /> Initially, the missionary passed through tissue that many people had moved so deeply to tears through this movie. I thought "ok ... but it takes a lot to make me cry." Imagine my surprise when I found myself crying! It is truly an inspiring and inspiring testimony to Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Watch it and believe it is a powerful message!
