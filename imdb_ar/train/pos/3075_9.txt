Wonderful film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, love. Messi is such a great actor. It was a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who appears to be part of a nervous sexual body but does not have the pieces needed to work with him at the level called by the script. But he is a good actor so much that he has fallen to the level of making the viewer work. I highly salute Tracy Olman as a neglected wife. Who knows? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look longer (and even smaller in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Messi's portrayal of the only situation his character can not be careful about is not perfect.
