I am a fan of Hull Hartley's films, especially Henry Bean's 1997. "Fay Grim" is a sequel to this film, with a similar style and humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Faye Grimm (who played a good role by the famous Parker Bossi) is trying to track the notes of her missing husband and finds herself caught up in plots and espionage. The cast (most of the people from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum, Safron Burroughs, and a much-welcomed return from beloved Elena Lewinson in the 1990s) are excellent and the film has a lot of surprises. The director claims that this is part of the "Star Wars" trilogy, such as "Empire Strikes Back" for the series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I hope I do not have to wait another 10 years for that.
