This was one of the first CREEPY movies I saw ... I was about 5 years old at the time. He scared me good! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. She had to clean my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eyes looked like the smell of mint! Now this is a movie! Hey it's time it was a wonderful film. The head sitting on the tabletop was as real as it used to be. If you have 5 it is very scary! Children are now spoiled days of special effects that appear too much and leave nothing to the imagination of your mind. Your mind can imagine things more terrifying than special effects! (IMO)
