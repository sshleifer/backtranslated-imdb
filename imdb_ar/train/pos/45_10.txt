Home Room was a great movie if you had any drama in your life. Keeps you wanting to see more. I wonder what secret Alicia hides. I think I watched this movie six times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually do not cry on movies but this made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like this one. All in all I thought it was a wonderful movie. The more you see it, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that made me cry when I got a diploma, because it was named after her daughter. My heart felt as if it had crashed after that. And how her new girlfriend came to comfort her when she did not get her salary yet. I love it so much.
