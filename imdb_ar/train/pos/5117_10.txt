Very few films had an impact on American culture the way Urban Cowboy did. Praise be to God was temporary. But UCLA is almost one season as one of those clicks that when the channels roll at 3:00 am, you can not close your eyes ... The top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but this is next to the point. I remember hitting the Urban Cowboy theaters and overnight, the highton was opening at every corner, and the men were wearing cowboy hats with their bouncy loafers, and if you did not know how to do two steps, you would be socially stunned! I personally think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me in the wake of SatNiteFever. Who was Thank? It's already very reasonable. Sound is great. Too bad Charlene Tilton, of the famous Dallas TV fame ruined the reason Johnny's career told me that the guy was fantastic. The show's Seeler is Scott Glenn as a former covert cowboy. I do not face anything against former cowboys like quirks, but I always envy what I feel is the biggest power line of all time .... "The package in S * # t!" Kind of like Clint "Make my day." And watching him slap Sisi is the closest thing I'll see in my fantasy Julia Roberts up ..... as I said, beautiful. 9/10
