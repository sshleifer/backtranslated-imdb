This film is very interesting, and has a great collection of actors such as William H. Macy who always perform this kind of roles, and perhaps most of his actors, Fargo; George Clooney is a very good actor who displays his comedic work in the Cohen Brothers' ? " Which leads to one of my favorite movies at all! But it was hard to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. My city lacks good places where you can buy some good movies. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster but they do not know it by their original name, so maybe it would be a little easier to find out if I have the name they launched in Mexico, does someone know it ?, because I can not remember!
