I sucker for movies like this. Movies that bring you back and allow you to restore your childhood. I have grown up now and I have many responsibilities as adults, mortgage, dogs, wife and a large number of others. I enjoy my life, but it is not as innocent and humble as it was when I was 12 years old. Indian summer Mike Binder knows this and explores this as he was at the age of twelve. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and more enjoyable. It brings you back to a time when you were worried about your first kiss and wondering if you could end the marathon in the camp was important. Indian Indian is a wonderful movie and you should watch it at least once a year so you can sit and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as children's friends are summoned to Camp Tamakawa by their former Camp Counselor, Uncle Lu. Uncle Lee played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is the kind of man who is the patriarch of the group. It is also known and includes the true spirit of the Father's personality and the person who understands simple things in life. He has a difficult time with today's children who need a walk-in device in their ears when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakawa. It is a camp that roams through the camp, leaving gradual colors given to them by God and water as far as the eye can see. The old man longs for the old days and asks the two former camps to return to the camp to see who will take over the camp. While they are all together again, we recognize their experiences and their plight, and a new love may arise between them. <br /> <br /> With adults returning to the camp, it was not long before they acted like children again as a typical camp prank is played back. They take toilet paper from stalls, put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All this is done with joy, and with representatives such as Pollak and Paxton, all these things are very funny. <br /> <br /> But as far as joy is concerned, we can explore some of the most intense feelings that anyone can relate to. In one of my favorite audiences, Kevin Pollack and Elizabeth Perkins look out over the bay where they used to rowing in their childhood. Pollack can not overcome his small size, and Perkins finally told him that the Gulf was not even smaller, but bigger. Do not knock this point at home, but do it skillfully. We all grow up, we all move, and unfortunately we can not live as we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the longer they are. <br /> <br /> Indian Indian is a character-driven film, beautifully written by Mike Binder, who has already attended Camp Tamakwa camp (as did Sam Raimi, who played the stick in the film) and his fond memories and vivid experiences of the film. There are many moving scenes and there are many fun scenes too. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it, which is a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
