Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than his predecessor. The director knew what he was working on and took the constraints of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It is a fun film that is technically sound and representative. The performers do not take themselves seriously, and everyone seems to be in a joke this time and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more comfortable in front of the camera and not as harsh as in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie a lot and strongly recommended it. Just like his first film, he is directed at a certain audience (I strongly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this stage of his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highjly recommended.
