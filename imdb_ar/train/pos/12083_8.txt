The second feature relates a young woman in London desperate for a job, happy to accept a secretarial job with an elderly woman and her son. The excitement about people being held in a house against their will makes me always a little uneasy - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this rather elegant film is not angry or scared. He is out of reach and unlikely, but not willingly, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. This rewording in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved to be unwise, because the elements of the plot are not modern. Julia Ross is very compact (very short in 65 minutes!) But she stays in good track until she climbs too high and feels a little dirty. *** from ****
