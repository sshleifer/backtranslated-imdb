Currently on the new METOO schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, immediately after "Maverick" and before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if you actually watched a episode of it when it was originally, but I'm really intrigued. Strange, unusual and surreal stories lie in mythical West. Type of "bare city" for Westerners. <br /> <br /> The stars are there: Dan Doria, Lille Beetger, Brian Donleaf, McDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as Mexican left), Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Perry Jr. , Margaret Chapman, and even Ann Robinson ("World War"), Gloria Talbot ("I Married a Beast from Outer Space") ran eight seasons, more than 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is a wonderful manager of the Favory Generation Trail, the toughest guy ever, with the samurai honor code, and the only right balance between toughness and openness. I would like to vote for the President on any given day. (Note: he had an interesting autobiography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood's young man is absolutely amazing as his right-winger, Rudy Yates. Also, the veteran Western actor and character of rural music (the one-eyed "One-Eye, One-Century", "Fly Purple People") is a veteran scout, Beth Nolan. Paul Brenner is the most unusual personality in the cook that can be called "wishbone". <br /> <br /> Then there is this wonderful song song, performed by Frankie Lin Immortal. (Between that and "Maverick" theme, I have Western songs of a special character throughout the day). <br /> <br /> I look forward to each episode; I gather the entire group. It always ensures a good time (not to mention the moo ving experience), where one is waiting to see if the boys will have complications before the announcement. <br /> <br /> "Rollin", rollin ', Rollin "."
