I nominated this and BABYLON 5 as the best scientific television series. Both arise in my mind because, unlike the earlier STAR TREK series, there is a steady evolution in conspiracies and personalities. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, it was a good offer, but there was no theme or comprehensive chart linking all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch the shows out of sequence completely without having difficulty understanding what is going on. This was not the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its huge battles that lasted every final season) and other TREK shows, where there was more of the bigger story that united it. This coherence appears to have evolved as a concept in BABYLON 5 and this was further felt by Study Group 1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like a family or a long narrative slowly forming. Sure, there were some "hidden" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but they were very few and far apart, and were also very funny. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the funny thing, I liked that SG-1 kept the mood from time to time and was not dangerously dangerous. In this way, I enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a wonderfully wonderful character and Homer Simpson's love - it's very bad that he slowly faded from the series in subsequent seasons. <br /> <br /> To truly estimate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how the plots work intricately. This coherence gives the show exceptional survival power. If you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, science fiction is probably not for you.
