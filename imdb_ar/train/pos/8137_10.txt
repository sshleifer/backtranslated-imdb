If you like CB4, you have no idea what you're missing if you do not see this movie yet. This movie is very crazy, and includes a lot more about the hip-hop industry than any other parody movie ... Unfortunately this movie was not released on DVD because it's one movie that everyone has ever seen and loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and want to hip hop and you're used to some old school artists, find out this definitley movie. There are not many video rental places with copies, but if you come across a place you will not be disappointed.
