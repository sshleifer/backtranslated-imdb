Photography is fun and the environment is very realistic. I loved it boldly addressing the tough social social misconceptions of mainland China in the 1930s and more basic human questions - I felt that I could get a real sense of time and recreate it even in wonderful footage of traditional Chinese theater and in pure pictures of living on the streets . It looked worth the experience. The intertwined role of Buddhism is probably the truest - in terms of the inferior, philosophical, and perhaps the most effective aspect I have seen in the Chinese film. The casting is wonderful. Photos are memorable. The representation is strong enough. Childish but objective but still rich enough to carry the vehicle of his expression.
