I do not agree with the previous comment about this film. I thought it was nice and enjoyable and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap whore to be cool. You can be smart, wonderful and stylish at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast is good and the story was good for the target audience. All in all my wife, daughter (10) and I think it was every good film. Definitely recommend it. He also encouraged my daughter to start reading Nancy Drew's original secrets which I'm sure she will love as much as Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for this film than to raise interest in this classic series.
