Despite the passage of many people unfortunately, the scene of the celebration hall is still alive and continues in their heritage. Still some alive and well, the Octavia is brighter and more beautiful than ever, and the Ninja follows has been very accomplished and provides great support to the LGBT community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just passed last year for natural reasons, God's mercy on them. After the death of Angie Carmen became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza (she was in the beach scene) and she looks more beautiful and more. Some balls have special categories for those who passed, so all of them are at peace. There is currently another project under way known as "How do I look?" , You can check the site at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
