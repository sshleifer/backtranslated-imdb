Stanley and Iris show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to become educated and realize its potential. For the iris, is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance performed by Robert de Niro and Jean Fonda together, starting and stopping, before they have both the skills and the courage to firmly trust each other and move on. In this sense, it provides us with a good view about life, and then be reliable. Unlike some other reviewers, the characters that were introduced were found to be compatible with the entire image. The support template is also carefully chosen and adds depth of character to which the key characters give additional meaning of supporting presentations. All in all Excellent movie. The best thing to take from him is hope.
