Paulie looks like the most saccharine, lemon, and emotional trash you can find at any time, but it's actually much better than you'd expect. It was easily possible to determine the tone in the entire film plot, but in fact in most other departments, the film is charming. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. I bought a little girl with speech difficulties, and Pauli became her best friend and went with her everywhere. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy classes, and eventually becomes a very smart speaker. However, Paulie is sent by the little girl's mother as he spends the rest of the film trying to get from New York City to Los Angeles to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> So, why does this terrible sounding film succeed relatively well? First, it has some impressive moving effects and admiration. Second (and much more importantly) that she has the courage to adopt her ridiculous premise and tells a truly touching story, many humor often without having to worry about obvious flaws in the story story. Thirdly, she has many amazingly powerful performances, including Jay Mohr as a cynical assailant, Jenna Rowlands as a great lady, and Shish Marin (yes, Chek Marin who smokes the drug!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be classy, ​​but Paulie is a vocal entertainment for children of all ages.
