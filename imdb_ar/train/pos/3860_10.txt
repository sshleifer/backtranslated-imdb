In the Netherlands, Gerard (Geron Krabi) lectures. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Rene Soutendijk) and having sex with her (by imagining she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but sees the picture of her close friend Christine Hermann (Tom Hoffman) and decides to stay for his experience. Then things become strange. <br /> <br /> A large X-rated art house in the United States in 1983. Why was it classified as X? Let's see ... there is suffocation, full frontal nudity for females and males, castration, mutilation, sex, scene in a church with a cross will hit most people, sexy gay scene in a basement ... and all that comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after the "letters". Spetters were attacked by critics because it was an extreme sexual sequence and was denounced as garbage. So Verhoeven was filled with a very clear film, thinking that critics thought it was an art and praised. He was right! Critics liked that the film did not realize that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It was beautifully filmed by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there are many symbols and hidden "hidden" layers in the dialogue that never get bored. All the wonderful acting - Krabbe plays a completely despicable character, but (somehow) has his rooting; Soutendijk is just amazing to look at and play her role in perfection - the small smile she offers when Gerrard agrees to stay with her chilling; Hoffman is very handsome with a great body - Worth the credit to do the church sequence and go with Krabi in the basement. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are easily insulted or have a weak heart, but if you love extreme movies that defy the comic (like me) this is you! 10 along the way.
