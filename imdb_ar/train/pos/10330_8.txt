This is actually a trilogy of 3 short stories of Somerset Mojam. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. 17 years later, Albert Foreman was dismissed from his work in the church because he could not read or write. So what does he do? Of course, opened a store for tobacco! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, who was in fact a story I read to the school six years ago and forgotten immediately, until I heard the familiar introduction. Last 15 minutes one, also very good. It was better for the film than for me, but then maybe it was because I was just 14 years old the last time, the third part was almost lost. Approximately an hour in length, it simply pulls. Not so bad, but not as fast and hurt as in the second. I watched the first quarter hour and then moved forward to the last quarter hour, and found that it still makes sense and I did not check the thing! <br /> <br /> In general, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
