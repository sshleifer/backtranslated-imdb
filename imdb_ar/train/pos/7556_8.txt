Well, this was a good good episode. Much better than the balance you get. <br /> <br /> The camera work is great. The best yet. I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are fantastic, and the guest (minus the helpless victims) plays a role. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is that many things are not explained. Why does sex change? What is the purpose? Are they foreigners? what type? Why did they not reappear in subsequent legends? <br /> <br /> I give this episode three stars. One of my favorites so far, but the holes in the plot bother me. Still ... will not let her ruin my entertainment.
