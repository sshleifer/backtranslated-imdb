Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to watch. It was a very deep feeling and he had a lot of humor that makes you suck you completely. It is very much like real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, a cocky teenager, but with a healthy heart finally deals with love in all the right places that deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with the old-fashioned grandmother, and the girl he wants to use already uses. I recommend people watching this movie because it will be like you see a real family. This is how much the film feels. I felt one minute when Victor's grandmother was throwing the victor at a simple thing. Victor was really upset and did not believe she would do anything like that. He made me feel real sorry for him because he was real. Overall I give this movie B +
