After all these years, I still consider this series the best example of documentary filmmaking in World War II. Interviews with many participants from all countries distinguish this from any other project. It would be great to watch a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) On this subject and try to collect information from veterans before they all go. With modern technology to improve footage of ancient archives and a lot of information that has been discovered since 1974 when the world was produced in war, an updated version of this series will be welcome. History provided some good performances dealing with many aspects of World War II, but a wide range like World At War has not been successful since the original. If you are interested in this era do not miss this series. Display required.
