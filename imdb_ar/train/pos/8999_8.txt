These films do not make any tonnage efforts to hide their true type - Campy B movie. I will tell you at the beginning of the definition of campy definition. You must also give the meaning of cheese recipe. But the two meet in this film in ways that make you go, "Hmmm ... that's so stupid!" Then you laugh. For example, there is a scene back in the "16th century in Japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the front of the temple. In the background of the temple, there are many tourists looking from away in slippers and shorts. Hmmm ... Haha! I could not stop laughing. The representation moves from decent to probable to my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to dig to some extent because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays which are fantastic. Her time in the film was very short. I have also seen Brian Yamasaki in many plays on the islands during my visits and he is also better in the theater than in this film. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie, if you do not have something to do on the evening of the week.
