Wang Bianlian is an ancient street performer known as the "King of Masks" for mastering the art of changing Sichuan. Liang is a famous opera opera of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is concerned that precious art does not have to die with Wang so he sows the crown seed in Wang's mind. The film revolves around biases, male dominance, artistic status, values ​​and most importantly warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film enough. The whole movie is in episodes. Everything is important. It's a long, well-edited story with only 91 minutes of film length. Complete satisfaction. For five minutes, it's a technical film, the next five minutes is a sad film, and five minutes, it's an exciting film. She just changed her temperament as the protagonist changed his face. The last scene on the rope is unusual. The story and the scenario are flawless. The actors are fantastic. Both of my protagonists are artists who can tell you the way they performed. Very dazzling. He was not nominated for the Oscars. That year, the English Patient won the Oscar for Best Film, and won the Coolia Prize for the foreign film. "Culia" was fine, and around "patient English", the better. Watch it 9/10.
