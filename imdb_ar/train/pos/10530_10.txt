What a delightful movie ... <br /> <br /> This film is accompanied by Oscar-winning RACHEL PORTMAN, and this film remains a pure joy worth seeing more than once a year. <br /> <br /> An incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Tony Collett was as wonderful as Harriet Smith. <br /> <br /> The character that stole the movie was Miss !!! She was fascinated by watching, and found himself at the edge of his seat just hanging on it with every word and laughing hysterically. One of the most beloved characters I've ever encountered. From one of the opening scenes when she thanked Mr. Woodhouse for sending him "the wonderful pork tasty pork ... pork, mother !!!" She screams in her violent face and hears very faintly of the poison, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Felida Lo), who looks sad and misguided. <br /> <br /> Comics that will be avoided by Ima Sourat Miss Bates the same fateful in one scene really shine in the promenade when Emma humiliates Miss Bates who cruelly transfers her to her heart. Then we see poor Miss Bates stumbling and about to cry, one can only crush her but feel that his heart has broken off on her behalf. It's a classic scene, revamped and played again ... <br /> <br /> The ending is completely with "Sense & Sensibility" and offers one of the greatest lessons in life on how to marry one's best friend ... <br /> <br> /> I hope this movie will please you all as much as I love myself. <br /> <br /> I like it!
