From a musical point of view, Irving Berlin gave Fred Esther and Jenger Rogers another musical play after Top Hat if possible. Although in such a case of the circuit of Jerome Kern Roberta where they were, the fleet kept Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Heliard. A former vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget ginger Rogers his former partner. But now they are on vacation on the beach. Fred and Ginger take their right where they left, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's harried sister Harriet who blooms in real beauty. But Randy is the love model 'em and let' s sailor em. <br /> <br /> Once again, Irving Berlin wrote a success story that is fully supervised. Ginger gets some really loud sounds with Let Yourself Go, which she and Fred are looking forward to later. But the real success in the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, a number that was completed in the Navy show. Astaire first sings and then the couple dances later, Let's Let the Music and Dance is one of the best romantic characters ever written on the screen. Their dance on this is absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, he may ask a few younger people than he was. But they will know immediately when I mention her with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. This is true of Uzi and Harriet. It is a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she became just illiterate for David and Ricky on television. Then again she did not retain her name. <br /> <br /> Ozzie or Harriet did not sing on television. Ozzie was a pale tradition of Rudy Valley as a singer, but Harriet could have a real tone. She sings Get her behind me The devil and the moon I'm here, but where are you, with a real feeling and class. I advise you to see "Follow the Fleet" if there is no other reason but to hear a post from Harriet Helyard is incredibly forgotten today.
