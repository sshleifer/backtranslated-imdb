This film seems to have received bad criticism for some reason. Perhaps only by the mass masses. Anyway, this is actually a very interesting film. The film is a low-cost science film that actually works, because of an interesting story and great scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If there are any science fiction lovers reading this, I would really recommend this film if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The setting includes countries that are going to go to war with GIGANTIC machines in which entire countries invest all their money! The world was divided into provinces. Anyone can challenge anyone else in the war, or rather a "robotic duel." The way of war is cleaner than nuclear war, because everyone is wearing these breath masks. Surely a movie makes you think. Smart effects, well written and good for the huge budget. <br /> <br /> I like to like movies that have small budgets and are already working.
