Green Eyes is a wonderful movie. In today's context to support our troops, it is interesting that this film showed disrespect for soldiers who received their duty, during this period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam War left us with something to remember and learn from. Jean was very proud of this film, and earned the credits he earned from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not being shown often, or at all. This movie is the kind of movie that needs to be shown on TV every year, just like Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man towards his lost son is fully moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. rocky
