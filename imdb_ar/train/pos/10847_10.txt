I am 60 years old, guitarist, (lead / cadence), and over the past forty years, I have been in four teams, everything there, battles, mistakes, rotten food, worst housing, always travel, little or no money, Drunk or high. But clubs, fans and music made it worth it! Just like exotic fruit! I have become very old for me now, arthritis in my hands and hips does not mean more swing, but for the length of that video, everything is back and everything was there! Birds, fights, wine! I was young again! It is like the voice of Billy Connolly, God loves the seventy things! Rock forever!
