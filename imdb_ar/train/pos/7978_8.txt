This movie contains the only element that all films of revenge must possess and this is the true passion. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are a lot of emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is very captivating. The plot on paper looks like garbage that is often thrown in the faces of the masses but should not be wrong, this film is strong. Washington is always doing great. <br /> <br /> The plot is short: the man suffers from depression, a little girl bring him life, kidnaps children, wants man revenge. It does not sound like anything special but much superior to any other similar movie out there. For a moment, TAKEN is a similar movie but when you compare them, you win MAN ON FIRE. The characters are attractive and they all perform wonderfully and manage it beautifully. Mexico City feels like it is alive, and it looks like Mexico City, smelling of Mexico City. Everything is brilliantly portrayed. The style of direction was something you enjoyed and brought to the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you will come out every year to see again or a movie you will enjoy family and friends to watch. From start to finish you root the main protagonist, making it a roller journey. There are enough actions to keep you happy, there is enough evolution of personality to satisfy you and then there is Washington to give a smile to your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
