Anyone watching this movie will agree. This film was directed at the days when the importance of the plot and the authenticity of the subject matter was important. <br /> <br /> Jan Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter stole the lights. Ritter is at the highest level as a "Moe" informant and lives in the Bowery section of New York City, where she works as a New York City police red pigeon. <br /> <br /> The only other film in which Peters saw is "Niagara", which certainly proves her ability to act here, complete with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is an appropriate threat, being an anti-hero who has to distinguish what is right, despite the need for money. <br /> <br /> Photography is great. Neon, metro station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!) The harbor hut where Widmore live is passing. Excellent use of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; many of the flavors and delicacies are taken in the city here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.
