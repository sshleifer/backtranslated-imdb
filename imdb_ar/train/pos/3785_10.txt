This film is very underestimated. It's very innovative, creative and smart. It's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first film. But the film was forgotten when it was first shown, and has been ignored more with the passing of the years. "Billus Ted's Bogus Journey" was also bombed at the box office, while the first one was very successful and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie was just released too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted seemed already "so 1980s". Although the 1980s were only two years old at the time, the musical landscape and musical style of children has changed radically with rap bands, hip-hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Grunge and Seattle Sound. Bill and Ted with Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses, along with the 80s old style, seemed unfamiliar and back in 1991, and I think that's one of the big reasons why the film was blown up at the box office. No one but surfers still say things like "Excellent!" And "fake!" In 1991. The movie "Gremlins 2", which also appeared in the early nineties of the last century suffered a similar to that it was a good film was bombed at the box office because it was very related to the eighties. The transition from the 1980s to the 1990s was a much faster change now with the 1980s and 1980s. 1991 was not like 1988 or 1989, while 2002 and 2001 still looked like 1995 or 1996. If an "excellent adventure" was released only in 1988, However, instead of 1989, a "fake flight" was issued quickly and issued in 1989, and is likely to be received in the same manner as the first.
