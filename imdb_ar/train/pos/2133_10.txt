I've lost the number of times I've seen this film - I probably know all the dialogue back - yet I've been drawn to it over and over again. <br /> <br /> In Jimmy, a young Jimmy Stewart in Hungary plays the qualified single "Karlik" who becomes the secret admirer of the innocent Margaret Solvan "Clara". Karlik becomes a close friend of Clara, and in working together Klara trusts Karelik about the content of his messages. It is clear that Karlik is besieged with Clara - but he is unable to make his feelings known while he is in competition with the "pen friend". Confused? Well it will not be - this story has a sweet and almost sweet ending - but we all know it's the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other noteworthy personalities are that Frank Morgan plays his usual role, this time the owner of the store "Hugo Matushik", Felix Presart as "Perovic", a close friend of Karlik. Joseph Childcrawt as an arrogant female "Vadas" - played so well that you can only hate him from the start. <br /> <br /> Finally William Tracy, who has managed to endear himself to all of us through his novice apprentice to a small shop "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently redesigned as "Got Mail" starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I doubt that the younger audience does not agree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area during Christmas, I suggest that you pour yourself a nice glass of wine and put a record on fire and put a box of Kleenex easy to use.
