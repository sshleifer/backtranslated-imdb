The first of two modifications made by Jim Thompson in 1990 (the other two are the most famous of GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK contains all the hallmarks of Thompson: Dangerous women, game trust, characters that are not either as bleak as others think they are being, or not being not harmful. <br /> <br /> Jason Patrick is a wonderful former boxer who is not qualified for this sport for life because of an episode in the ring (James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire to color the back story) and the unprecedented Rachel Ward channel also provides Great performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the film: the giant giant giant giant giant giant giant (Bud Bud) cleverly manages each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it ready to suck in the void.
