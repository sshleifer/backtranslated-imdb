Yes, it's flawed - especially if you're in Hollywood movies that require a lot of influences, a story or plot that is purely amusing or fanciful, and you can not think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg Films are for smart filmmakers, and Insignificance is an ideal example. <br /> <br /> Profiles are fantastic, and the story is excellent, but like all Nic Roeg movies - I've thought about every aspect of a reality that never came before. His films always make you think, and I personally like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> So do not expect to get away from watching this movie and feel happy, because you will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's excellent.
