Do not believe all the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes, it's made cheaply. Yes, Gore is laughable. And yes, acting is substandard. However, this is an example of a school book for the early slippery flick, and if this is the "thing" (my king!) You will enjoy it. There are good enough aspects to this film to make up for flaws. For one, the result by Christopher Young is then unknown is very creepy and completely violent dialect. The end is a welcome break from the optimistic endings expected for most films. Last but not least, the setting is which made the film for me. The filmmakers could do a much better job of "dressing" the group to make it more believable as one of the college's residences. However, if you can overlook this flaw, the setting is wonderful. Four of his colleagues are alone in a huge abandoned and condemned building just waiting to be demolished ... It responds to possibility. When you watch, let your imagination do some work and enjoy this movie as much as you enjoy it.
