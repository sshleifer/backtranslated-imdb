This film contrasts with baseball, and runs counter to what I expect in a sports movie: a sport with an authentic appearance, believable characters and the original storyline. While the "Angels Abroad" failed miserably in the first category, they succeeded beautifully in the last two categories. Angels tells the story of Roger and JP, two Anaheim boys who love baseball but are looking for a family, with the woebegone Angels franchise, struggling to attract the masses and win games. Inspired by his father's murderous promise that they will only be a family when the angels win the flag, Roger asks for some heavenly help, and he gets it in the form of sedentary spirits bent against the downward spiral of concession. When George Knox begins the melted short director (portrayed by Danny Glover) in believing what Roger sees, the team suddenly has the hope of changing their season - and Roger and JP find something they believe in. Good performance, Tony Danza, plays the role of a washed jug, well well, although ZERO has a clear idea of ​​how to get rid of the windup!
