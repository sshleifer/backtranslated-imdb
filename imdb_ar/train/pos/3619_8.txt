Although Disney has done its best, it's a fun movie to follow your dreams. I was surprised that he did not beat me excessively; I played this fair film. Dennis Quid was very good at this role, which says nothing about a sports movie. I can not remember the number of sports films that had a few quirks that bother me; here, everyone looks at the part. This film is amazingly good, and I expect it will perform amazing works because it is a G-movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. On the contrary, this film has been a great success.
