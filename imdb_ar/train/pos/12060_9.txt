I really miss the production of good old Spooky movies. If Ismail Murchant and James Evori were commissioned to produce such a film, it might be the film, except for the absence of an internationally known drawer group. This is one of those movies you see on your own in a dark evening with pizza and some popcorn, so you do not cost yourself to bother the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, author Susan Hill and Nigel Kneil, John Bunker's top production design, John Dale's Art Direction and excellent actors to make me tremble and feel isolated even though I live in one of the world's most populous cities at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave it a "9" of "10" because they were with production and budget limitations for the TV, and really pulled out of the awesome program.
