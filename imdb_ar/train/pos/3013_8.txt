The talented investigator Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a case of a purported suicide that has good reason to doubt it is something much more, a fairly complex homicide! <br /> <br /> As far as mysterious murder films go, they do not get much better than this movie. Full of suspicious characters, all linked to the dog show and all have very good reasons to kill the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe, it is really hard to discover this person or wrap it around him but the boy, it proves to be wonderful to see him unfold before us. Even police, courts and lawyers are colored, add characters that add a level of unexpected bold realism to that person's actions, and modify the overall fun factor. I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the criminal investigation judge (played by Etienne Gerardo), who always seemed to have brazenly and timidly intercepted the discovery of dead bodies or men during the time of his employment. Also Eugene Ballet Sergeant. Heath welcomes the welcome, often a late play on his account, a critical comment during the Vance investigation. I can not think of any proper criticism to give this film in fact but it may not have been well dated. The film does not prevent it from being just a good watch though. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one puzzle. Highly recommend bid!
