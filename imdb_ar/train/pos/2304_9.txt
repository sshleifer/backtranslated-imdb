I think this movie was very good. It happens in the middle of 1950, everything seemed to be accurate to me. It was well cast and certified. I do not usually care about this type of film, because they do not have any depth, but I felt that this film has deviated in the characters and can feel how they felt, and you really know them and care about them. He brought me back to my youth and let me remember a more innocent time. This movie can be enjoyed by both males and females and all age groups. After the film ended I wished I had the second part. I wanted to know what happened to Danny and her family. This film is bound to be classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when you're on TV or rent it ...
