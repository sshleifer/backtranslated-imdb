This hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny according to its own terms and also very funny unintentionally). Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One is given to pinup poses and fun comments where you go. The other has risen to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those little predatory sensual lips. And so as not to give up anything, they are worse than others. <br /> <br /> All three sisters played starry roles. The man who stumbles in their lives is played by John Brumfield. He had something of a profession. <br /> <br /> This day seems like the first porno to be marketed at all. Well, of course not the first but most active at the time. <br /> <br /> Girls wear as little as possible and do not forget the members of the public: Bromfield shows up and shaves with an electric razor - which fetish was this? - Naked breasts. He also appears wailing as he wears a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There's a real conspiracy here too: Girl curses, see, curse. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can look like suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it was introduced. It may have been made in additional drives. Somehow, I was wrong, I felt that ordinary male audience was not the main goal here. Women are wearing thin clothes. They often look like hard covers from cups like a police detective or jackets from Dime novels. <br /> <br /> But the man seems to be the focus. Not everyone loves him in the film, but all the girls love him. I think the public is also dedicated. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and with its own conditions too.
