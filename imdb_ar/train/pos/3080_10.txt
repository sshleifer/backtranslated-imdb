I have complained to ABC of canceling six degrees. If enough people do the same thing, it may be enough to bring back this wonderful show to life !! Go to the official website and the rest is simple enough. I do not understand why this offer was canceled. What a wonderful show, cast and characters. The whole concept controls the viewing! I am surprised that my favorite program ended after just one series. why is that? Six great grades, it's better than many other TV shows out there! I even heard that they were stopping him from a friend. This did not happen to me.
