When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands on the edge of a high terrace above the city, seems hypnotized and is expected to come close to his death, he immediately reminded me of a similar scene in another film produced nine years later, "The Green Woman" Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) similarly threw himself into space during his sleep. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes have survived these attempts to kill unscrupulous criminals. When will they learn that you can not hide the minds of great imaginary investigators?
