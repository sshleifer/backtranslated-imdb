If anyone asks if cinema is a form of art, you can do worse than direct them to this film. <br /> <br /> The story of a bomber pilot who is doomed to failure by his heavenly captain in English fog during the Second World War and his subsequent brushings with heavenly powers (or in his head) with David Nevin and Kim Hunter's pain and touching is unbelievably played - Especially in the opening scenes when the convicted pilot (Neven) describes his ordeal to the ground-based radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The sensation of the other world is increasing Jack Cardiff's images and stunning production designs. <br /> <br /> The upper touches extend to the sky shots that appear in black and white scenes and the floor presented in Technicolor - this is what the heavenly Mosul (Marius GÃ¶ring) said. <br /> <br /> Not only is the high point in the British cinema, but the high point in the cinema, period.
