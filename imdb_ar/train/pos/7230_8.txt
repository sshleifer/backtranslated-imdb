The "invisible mouse" is a wonderful and wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoon. It is characterized by usual cat and mouse chases and fights, but in a different way this time. Jerry is accidentally in an invisible bottle of ink and is obviously very happy about this because he realizes that he can prepare, frighten, torture and confuse him. <br /> <br /> Since it is strange, it is also nice and funny to see what we can not see: Jerry is invisible. It's fun to see things flying in the air without seeing who does it (we know who, does not it?) - it's like those things that had their own lives or even ghosts. It's fun to see Jerry eating some candy and fruit while he is invisible. I really like that automated music that is played when it is not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes in this shortcut are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and criticizes him and even when Tom tries to criticize him with a frying pan. Jerry writes "I missed". I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, to become visible again with a happy look on his face. <br /> <br /> In general, this short contains the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some very nice artwork.
