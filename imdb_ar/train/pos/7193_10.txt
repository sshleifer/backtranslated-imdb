Allah! Zorro has been the subject of almost as many films as Tarzan, and probably has been around many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my favorites, and as mentioned earlier, it is one of the best 5 audio series. Strangely enough, this production was produced in the year of the Waterfall of 1939. * By the time of this production in 39, Zoro was truly known for his literary character and film (Pulp). The film begins with a small note about the history of Mexico's struggle for power from the European monarchy, Spain. The story calls for comparison with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the legendary San Mindelito district and its council. Benito Juarez discusses the relationship between the gold mine and the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must arrive in Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Uncle told Diego Vega that he had organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the golden convoys. Oro the mob, "insulting" himself and defying Don Francisco in a duel with swords, without running without Frasienescu. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the swordsman, covered in dark dark clothes, fights the sword and, after sculpting Z 'on the evil face, sends him to the Hereafter. Don Francisco, with the deadly breath of Ramon (William Corson), announces that Zoro is the son of his sister from Los Angeles. He also tries to find out the real identity of Don del Oro, but expires before completing the statement. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diego in Hacienda in Don Francisco, where Diego Ramonister (also a wing for Don Francisco) is disappointed with his timid act. "A FOP !!" , As advertised. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon flee to join a volunteer meeting. When they ask, "Who will lead us without Francisco's death now?" , Declares Ramon "Zoro, we are the Zoro Combat Corps!" Well, there is a big battle with the Legion, now dressed in gray, with masks and heads, to protect the Golden Train. Zoro then appears trapped in a man-made avalanche dedicated to the convoy, when he knows the end of the first chapter well. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was a lot of writing for a single chapter, but like most other series, the opening is longer and has a lot of ground to put the story line. Let us just give you enough to say that there are 11 chapters well and well filled and filled with the following procedures. <br /> <br /> ZORRO's FORING LEGION contains all the elements that are made to achieve the highest cliffhanger. We have an unknown evil leader that raises a problem among different groups. There are a number of suspects as to who was behind the mask of Don Del Oro. We had soldiers, white dissidents, hostile Indians, Corps. <br /> <br /> In short, it is safe to say that there is everything one can want, and then some, in this series. Incidentally, they choose wisely not to make representatives influence any Mexican dialects. <br /> <br /> As for what is just here that makes the ZFL distinct from the rest? What makes them different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it contains a more detailed and exciting musical score, which emphasizes the drama and movement on the screen. The opening theme even appears in the Flamenco guitar show in Cantina in the first chapter. This may be the only time that such highly specialized innovation has appeared in the serial audio track. <br /> <br /> However, there is another feature that really puts Fighting Legion in front of everyone else. This means that the film is not only a heroic musical theme, but it also includes sports songs, yes, the Filarists sing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It works really well and adds to the feelings we feel from the show. <br /> <br /> When the series was first shown on our local television (circa 1955), the band immediately identified the voice of Red Hadley as belonging to Captain Bradock of RACKET SQUAD, the television series. Mr. Hadley had a very deep and distinctive voice. *** He also took the role very well. His suit especially the elongated mask was very good and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip. A kind of simple irony occurs in an interview with Benito Juarez (Carlton Young) in front of the San Miguelito Council, where Juárez was about 18 years old at this time (1824), and although he may later have been the greatest individual figure in Mexico's history , But it certainly has not achieved this leadership yet. Perhaps his inclusion in the story was to take advantage of the JUAREZ version of Warner Brothers' JUAREZ that year, starring Paul Moni as the star. <br /> <br /> This is not the only choice for me as the best 5 audio series, but also my favorite movie is Zorro. <br /> <br /> * Reminds us of the great crop of the best flight movies that year, what happens with THE WIND, MR.MITH moves to Washington, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE MAGIC WITNESS, Mice, Men, Million BC , Zenobia, we want all our mothers to be counted among the outputs that year. <br /> <br /> Again, Juárez did not ascend to any national significance until about 1850, after about 25 years. Political subdivisions are also referred to as "provinces" in the story. In fact, they are called "states". As we call the United States of America, they also call the South of the border the name of the Czech Republic in the United States. <br /> <br /> *** Red Hadley was featured in some pictures "A" where his voice is being used for a rich tune for good effect. A witness to his novel at home on 92nd Street (1945) and Guadalcanal (1945).
