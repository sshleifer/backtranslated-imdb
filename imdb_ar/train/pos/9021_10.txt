I and my sister all 3 series of Tenko and I agree that this is one of the best BBC series ever. The entire group was very convincing in the parts they filmed, and although the third series was somewhat slower, it was an attractive sight and evenings that would not be the same without them. No doubt we will see it again because it is a series that will never get sick from seeing it. Excellent presentation and full BBC markings for such a great series and cast rate in all sections. Anyone will recommend this series although some age limits should be considered for some adult material. Very grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and video.
