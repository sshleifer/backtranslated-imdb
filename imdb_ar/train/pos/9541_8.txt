Wow, this is actually some horror / Gore Asian beautiful, crazy film crazy. This wonderful Japanese festival reminded me a little bit of Tetsu, but in this case with all the blood and courage, there is a strange love story. It is hard to imagine how they dreamed of this visually stunning film, with some unique alien creatures infecting humans with parasites, turning them into a partial machine or thinking cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after they have controlled the human is that they need to kill each other and eat the other. Hmmm, Yum Yum. This is likely to be called industrial stains or something like that, with a great soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also borrowed a bit from Carpenter's "The Thing" in designing creatures and their effects. I would like to put this in a category that must have wounds, because there is a non-stop massacre and some are very good. This must be for the stones, because you do not even need to read subtitles, visual images alone are enough for a mental journey. The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body reminds me of a little embryo of Frank Henluter films, another tribute to some excellent good films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a very fun game for the centuries, no doubt, and I just loved it.
