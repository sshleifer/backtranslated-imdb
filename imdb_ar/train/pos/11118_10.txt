The genre of gangs has now become a common theme, often parodyed. In the past, the series is the culmination of previous clichés used in this genre, thankfully that the book has advanced in this flaw by creating realism that has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic epic crime whose contents are profoundly self-explanatory, with subtle nuances, a sense of humor, and inconsistent violence. The protagonist, Tony Soprano, is seen as a public hazard fraught with fear and moral values ​​by his crew. However, Tony is one of two people, one of whom is better, while the other is against sin and resentment. Without any obstacles or contradictions, I still strongly believe that the Soprano has the best combination of modern memory. All the things that have been contemplated can make a detailed statement about the series, but I will not do that. If there is any visual dictionary in the global consumerism, look for these definitions, ambiguous, relentless, epic, uncompromising, and you will smile the giant views that crashed in the soprano.
