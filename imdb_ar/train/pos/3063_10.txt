The first filmmaker (Promel) assembled a small but powerful team to look at the world from a middle aged man, middle class of depression and his conflict with his relationship with his father. In less than 90 minutes, this film presents an incredibly interesting variation in human nature. David Dorfman is the son of William H. Messi, 6 years old, is the most refreshing little actor I've ever seen. Messi's wonderful part seems almost written for him as a self-torture outlet struggling to break the reins of his father and his work. It's always wonderful to see Donald Sutherland, who is as wonderful as the cruel father of Messi. The Alternative Soundtrack is worth it to hear the director explain how he chose the film, the locations, and the film. The Dolby 2 core sound is suitable for this movie and is well recorded. Cinematography creates mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any orange film or observer of human nature will enjoy this especially if it is a lover of contradiction.
