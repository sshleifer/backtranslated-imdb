I have become very fond of Olives in the past few weeks and I was thrilled to discover these gems. I've always found it wonderful when I watch a movie where I do not have to put my finger on the remote control if nudity is stripped of its ugly head. <br /> <br /> The Divorce of Lady X is so enchanting to the last scene, and it must be a real delight for viewers back in 1938. I just wish that today people can accept and love the real humor instead of talking horrible trash people now call it funny . <br /> <br /> The Divorce of Lady X is worth anyone's time.
