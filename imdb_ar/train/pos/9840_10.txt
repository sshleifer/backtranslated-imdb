Born again Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man can come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the head of a little girl <br /> <br /> Revenge will get < For murder, he met <br /> <br /> by the person who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me a very low classical story was born again. A loop forms part of the X-files for me before I start watching them. I had seen some slides before when the show started for the first time and I was too young to watch it like parts of Jersey Devil, but I remember specifically watching this episode when I was eleven years old and I got out of the scene exactly where the man is suffocated to death by bus and Then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I can not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the ring has its own halo now about the horror factor that has since grown to enjoy it. Just let me look at some obvious flaws in the plot, such as why a girl had to wait until she was nine years old before her former life began to take revenge. Or what she was doing just sitting randomly on a bus in the middle of the night. You think her parents were worried. Perhaps they did not see this part of the story. Was it with mental stimulation? Unlike really adding a curry to the already scary story, there was no good explanation for it. But even with small flaws, in my opinion it is a classic episode and there is no reason why I do not like it. 10 out of 10.
