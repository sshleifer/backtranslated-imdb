"My Home Notorious" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Haroon <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mall, Chris Bauer, Lilly Taylor, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn < br>> MPAA rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some languages) <br /> <br /> It seems that all the celebrities these days are getting autobiography about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biomes are very impressive right now. "My Notorious Home Page" is the latest release on DVD. The Gretchen Mol is the world's most famous model, the Bettie Page and has been filmed in black and white with some color quotations. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland," this film will not be the only one to watch the movie at the Oscars this year. This film lacks the emotional resonance that is presented in another biography, and most of the most dramatic moments in Beethie Beige's life are ignored or only suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad film. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a very entertaining and entertaining film - a powerful film work. This film focuses more on erotic page career and fine line between sexual activity and pornography. He was filmed with enthusiasm and care, and the direction of Mary Haroun depicts the shape and appearance of the time period where most filmmakers only dream. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by the mall). Whether you know it as an icon ?? Or as a simple porn star? You know her. She was a woman who had a profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than was appropriate at that particular time. Now, most people know it as one of the first sex symbols in America - a myth of many models, especially Playboy models and other adult magazines. She lived at a time when only one inch of the meat down the trash could catch a person, and Beige's model of bondage was the only thing that drove the American public into a fuss. In fact, the photos released a thorough Senate inquiry into the common decency and the difference between harmless and pornographic films. <br /> <br /> The performances at the notorious "The Bettie Page" are very impressive with the Gritchen Mall. Its performance as Bettie Page is simply fantastic. I understand that when this role was announced, many people were skeptical. Its name is not a name that jumps right away when I think of fantastic shows. Now, you will. She managed the whole role and attracted me through her very weak and attractive performance. David Strathorn's new "Good Night and Good Luck" last year, where he presented one of the best performances of 2005. Here, he performs well yet another post that is of little use. I was shocked at how limited it was on screen, but quantity quality is always the most important aspect of any good film. The only performance I saw from Lily Taylor was in The Haunting (1999). Although most people ignored the film, I found it an interesting, if not shallow, horror film, and I always thought Taylor was quite credible as Neil Nili's emotional film. Here, Taylor gives another reliable performance. They offer very poor performance and provide perfect performance to complement Gretchen Mol's performance. <br /> <br /> After typing and doing everything, I realized that my "notorious home page" could not be compared to other biologists, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line." It is incomparable to them because it tells the story of a woman and her career, from start to finish. Her personal life is implied for a short time, but its effect on the world is the fact of it. We watch the film and realize that the page will finally emerge and we know the impact of its decisions. But we rarely show the impact it will have on her personal life. She is a woman who has never looked back and can constantly reinvent herself. After all, the adult model was transformed into Christian missionary. This movie does not further dramatize anything. It could have included imaginary moments of hysterical lamination and begging God to forgive her. It would have been possible to show the page as it ran and screamed in the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of its past, but it did not. "My Notorious Home Page" tells a simple story that is rare today. Fortunately, it is completely refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final thought: "The Notorious Famous Page" is a comfortable movie with a very great cinematic. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (a)
