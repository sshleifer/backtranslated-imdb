I just saw "Valentine's Day" and I must say it was the best italic film I've seen in years. Contrary to the recent trend of horror novels in the 1990s, this film is more concerned than self-mockery. For those who hate the "cry", there is no single reference to the "horror rules" in this film (although the old rules of bright films apply here). <br /> <br /> This is a perfect combination of the 1980s and 1990s. You can get the elegance, cinematography, and good representation of the 1990s movies and the frenzy of the flick in the 1980s. I think the year 2001 will finally give horror fans the kind of movies they longed for. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out as a fun character. You can tell that she likes her role, and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this film.
