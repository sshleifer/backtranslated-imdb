Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston I was very skeptical the first time I saw this movie. I mean, what a conceptual nightmare. Jim Carrey plays God? There is nothing sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is hardly sacred, but it is also not sacred, at least not to a large extent. Yes, Jim Carrey enjoys the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I will give you the lowest level. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is overwhelmed by his luck and feels a lack of success in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Aniston), and you can tell the bats that they love each other, but the relationship on the ground is somewhat shaky. <br /> <br /> Bruce then gets hit by a bullet in the announcer, only to be robbed by Ivan Baxter. Obviously not, Bruce shares his ideas with the world through television in a comic way and certainly deserves his dismissal. <br /> <br /> He complains a lot about God and precedes him later, Bruce gets a page. After a while, he is fed up with communication, so he responds and goes to Omni Presents Building (Heh). There he meets God (Freeman), a boss, an electrician, and a Janitor in the building. I found this very amusing. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is an electrician, and Jesus Christ is the doorman. think about it. Coach, clear. An electrician, a man who keeps everything working. Janetor, the man who cleans the mess left by the world. Wow. <br /> <br /> In any case, Bruce suspects that he has already met God, but when God grants Bruce His powers and gives him the chance to play God, he begins to believe a little. I wonder why. Use blatant abuse of power to gain personal gain and abuse of enemies. <br /> <br /> Since this is Hollywood, it is clear that Bruce is finally aware, learning his lesson and starting to use his powers for the benefit of the world. In the end God screams to take her and prays that his will will be fulfilled, not Bruce's will. <br /> <br /> Since it is Jim Carrie, the movie is very enjoyable and there are definitely some very entertaining moments in it. The film is not a perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it's definitely a good try. Many of the statements in the film can be thought of as provocative and provocative, and I salute Tom Shadiak for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> So, although it's far from perfect, it's certainly a funniest movie with little thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth seeing or two)
