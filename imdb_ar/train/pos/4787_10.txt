David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles together in the wrong way. It's interesting to look at it and think about it, but they really do not care about you. Art may always mean the most creative thing. <br /> <br /> The straight story is not one of David Lynch's typical films. There is nothing typical about them anyway. It is an Odyssey across the American countryside. A real journey in life Alvin Street took the grass mower to get to his brothers' house. Ride 300 miles from Lorenz, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin makes his brother sick because of his previous crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film, Richard Farnsworth appeared beautiful. He brings Alvin straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow and slow is consistent with the slow journey of Alvin towards perception. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin meets a confused little girl. She is pregnant and decided to escape from her condition. After listening to Alvin talking about the family she is reviewing. <br /> <br /> Later on, two thousand astonished women witness the death of a gazelle in her car. She complains that she killed many people and foliage. Alvin feels bad but clever enough to cook some cherished meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, the lawn mower loses its two thousand brakes and kills it. A nice man and his wife allowed him to stay in the courtyard while he was stationary. They even allowed him to call his sweet but slow daughter, which was well played by Sissy Spike, who is haunted by a terrible tragedy in her past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to pay Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin backs down with thanks. <br /> <br /> While waiting for Alvin, he also goes to a bar with a gentle old man discussing the harshness of the war and the cost of their lives. Even Alvin recognizes a fatal mistake he committed as a hunter chasing him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin is also facing two disgruntled brothers who have mended the mower. Talking to them at the price wisely calls for higher labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate each other as he learns from his mistakes with his brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin left the man's yard, he took his hat to him. The man told him that it was an honor for me to stay, and asked Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. She is honest because she is very honest and true. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can no longer help to participate in it. We want Alvin to reach his brothers. We want him to correct. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. His last film and performance was amazing. You can only understand his pride, listen to his wisdom, and finally feel his pain. One gets along with him like the man who has his back yard to stay in. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, Alvin Street and his brother and Richard Farnsworth sit together in a bar. I can photograph them discussing their lives, their remorse, their hopes and their joys. As Alvin says in the film, "I and my brother used to look at the stars." Well, I know they all have the best view at home.
