Amazing ... <br /> <br /> At first I was not keen to watch Pinjar because I thought this would be another film that would scold partition and show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was completely wrong. Pinjar is a heart-beating, emotional and intelligent film without any obvious flaws. I was haunted by it after watching it. I stayed on my mind for a long time. The themes, pain, loss and emotion were all very real. <br /> <br /> It's really a masterpiece we rarely see in Bollywood these days. She has no biases or biases and has given the section a human story. Here, no one country is portrayed as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis, good Indians and Pakistanis. Excellent cinematography and music are sly and meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and hurtful. Everything about the film was amazing ... and taking acting was my breath. They were all portrayed perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in seeing a really thought-provoking movie ... no more research. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. Amazing can not describe how excellent it is.
