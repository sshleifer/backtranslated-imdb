A strange, intelligent and wonderful picture of family life! Author Andrew Marshall wrote something funny, scary and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be fooled by the 2 kind personality of jubilant children and billions. The display has a dark side, and sometimes it may be chilling. This is the good thing about the show, it's not just a simple comic play where each character is a two-dimensional comic device (as with My Family). Instead, the characters are fully rounded people who show the complete roller coaster of human emotions. The occasional dark moments like Bill is supposed to be haunted by a curse while Ben wakes up in a quaint village with two examples of the show taking a dark surrealism that helps add a little depth. Of course the show is very funny, content to make you smile. It is a real shame that Eureka Video has stopped releasing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is the last one to get in-store loops.
