I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not lead someone who has a strong style of cinematic presence. It may not be easy to present a Chinese fictional image to the public. The director has tried to re-tell the classic fairy tales of Mount Zu, and this is what he has presented. <br /> <br /> Legend of Zu really improved from one in 1983. From this new millennium update, we can see Tsui Hark's view of the Zu Mountains. Stunning visual designs, epic movement and fantastic imagination are well done. Keep me glued through the whole picture. Cast with wonderful acting is fine. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird? <br /> <br /> The downside now is that people will certainly be confused with the broad storyline that was shortened to a 95-minute film. The scheme may not have a great relationship between the characters, but by re-watching the movie, you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not much physical fighting, as well as those who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, and that hand-fought lives will not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this beautiful stylish picture. It may have a thin story, but what a look at the film "Time & Tide" presented by Tsui Hark, we felt confused by the plot too, but it was really a wonderful and neat thing. Tsui Hark always attracts something different to Hong Kong. Cinema. Some American audiences may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie, because this is not the "crouching tiger", the Hidden Dragon, this is a brand new genre. Although they may not be a masterpiece, they are really much better special effects than the Storm Riders. This is really worth checking out.
