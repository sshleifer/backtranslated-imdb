Less than true film tells the story of a young musician caught in an escalating spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to watch, while Maurice Day is depicted as a woman-hater, the prince as a knight. In the game (motorcycle), she is still invited to hit a woman twice as part of the scenario. Being able to do so and still stands out as a flawed but justified hero is credited with writing. An ego-free prince in this film does not portray himself as a narcissistic man who beats women, but his most famous song was conceived by his father, Wendy and Lisa. In addition, two of his works - Computer Blue (arguably the weakest track of the album) and Darling Nikki - are presented as songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to Princely ego is a card listing Apollonia (slightly shorter than Prince) as 5'6. <br /> <br /> The semi-complete cast is a band members playing themselves (and reviewers who have identified actors according to conditions never seen in other films, they are completely lacking point), and perform their tasks quite well under the direction. Morris Day gets the most praise for beloved pork, although Jerome Benton should be credited for wearing it well, especially his play, which is fun. Day and Benton goes even further to make the routine of Abbott and Costello funny, which requires some doing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Prince. While admitting bias, I actually think he is a good actor in terms of his ability to portray a low-level version of himself. Acting is not his profession, it was a film made for entertainment, so anyone points out that the man who plays a key role is not Robert Dineiro and that thinking that he is creating a point has been deceived. I do not want this review to be a scathing attack on others' comments, but even this film, which has a low budget and is darkened. How can a film about domestic violence be filmed? With full top lights and CGI dinosaurs walking in the frame? <br /> <br /> The film is almost a perfect shot of Neon and narrow necktie? So remember that it was already made in a world of wrinkled wrinkles and tiny creatures, and this is not some recreation. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, he sees it at its height, and sad to realize that although he will make some beautiful albums, he will not pick up that level again.
