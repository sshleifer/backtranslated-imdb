I have seen this film criticizing the statement, "If you can overcome ethics ..." This misses the goal. Ethics is in the conscience of the beholder, as it was. It is a respectable movie and a standard murder mystery, but with a distinctive touch appearing midway. The decision leaves the viewer wondering, "What would you do in this position?" I have to believe that this is exactly what the film director is referring to. To this end, to the end of entertainment for the public, the film succeeded. I also love the way in which violence is never on stage, but away from the camera. We know what has just happened; it does not serve us, then rubs in our faces, as is the case today with contemporary blood and clothing. Besides, violence is not the goal. The key point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, which is intelligently resolved, albeit worrisome.
