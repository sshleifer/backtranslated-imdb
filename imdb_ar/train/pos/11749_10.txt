Finally, we get a television series where we see the talent of acting! The first episode was excellent! He gave us the text a bit more than usual, yes, there is still "I am not your father - I am your father and Abigud who tricked me!" Nonsense but the script allowed representatives to feel and actually live those real moments rather than to explain to us what would be the case - much like a television soap. <br /> <br /> Also, the camera's work gave us a bit more than usual, there was no boring footage of the repeated angles for hours, but there were no "shots within shots or crap of a hand-held camera" to add the "artistic edge" gave us what We needed to see as well as some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /> <br /> There was not too much acting or melodramatic because they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked something in the drama and was very relevant. It was convenient to be exposed to real and very nice works to allow our country to see how talented our representatives are when they have real text, a real chance! Thank you Tony Tills, Sam Miller, Channel Ten and all cast and crew work! Please follow up on what you do, your efforts are highly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
