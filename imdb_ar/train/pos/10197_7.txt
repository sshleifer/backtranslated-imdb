Well, it's been a long time and I've been reviewing the final film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) took second place at the recent Manila Metro Festival. As expected, did not perform very well at the box office as it was very difficult for participating filmmakers, especially that MMFF is the season when many families come out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see a film that was not in Filipino or English being displayed on screen. I think Cesar Montano did a good job as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as a major star and was able to express the wide range of emotions required for the film. The young actress Rebecca Lusterio also performed well. She has done a wonderful job portraying Bikai, the younger sister of Duroy. I hope to see it in many future film projects that might venture into other types. I think the fact that this film was in its local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera footage in the movie has been done very well. The scene was made breathtaking, although I feel that if the effort seemed less different. <br /> <br /> From the story's point of view, I felt that the writers could have delved into the life of the less famous characters. I will certainly not be interested in the story of this film.
