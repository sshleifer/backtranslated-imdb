Please, your future book, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a bold and original story created for the big screen movies. Bold, because the script make a step down many fantasy movies safely avoid - step into something new, creative and bold. Just when you think "Oh, I've seen this before" or "I'm sure that's what will happen now" - StarDust will make an unexpected transformation and involve you more and more in the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are wonderful - even the smallest part is performed with such a talent that I am so appalled by the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is wonderful and leads with this energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he is in. Michelle Pfeifer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danis is a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving star, Evin. Other big names play prominent roles. I had the fill of everyone trying to do his best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he invented for the universe - simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in preview today, one day before the official release, and hope it has a great success. There is a lot of humor, but also tense moments as well as beautiful tender scenes. A look at the eyes of Yvaine, "the trivialities" of Captain Shakespeare, a passion for charming Lamia - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the first entertainment film of 2007, watched and enjoyed it <br /> < > 11/10 - Wonderful <br /> <br /> Peace and Love
