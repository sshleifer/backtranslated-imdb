This is one of the most precious stones that have been neglected in Hollywood. - A British fighter from the Second World War whose plane was about to collapse, has a radio connection with a young American woman relaxing the courageous pilot, knowing that within minutes he will die. For some reason, the man who must be dead, walks away from the ruins and finally learns that he was supposed to reach paradise. When a reporter is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to paradise, the man refuses and asks to have his "day in court" to plead his case. The man argues that his position has changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he fell in love and became another person, worthy of the opportunity to live in it. <br /> <br /> The "Heavenly Stadium" is a cinematic pleasure! The "jury declaration of peers" is a specific point of departure. The story, fantastic as it sounds, is an attractive story and will keep you up to speed for almost two hours of play. The last scene is simply beautiful and requires a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my top 10 favorites at all and has the highest recommendation!
