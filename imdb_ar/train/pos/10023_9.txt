After watching several Villaronga films, I had a clear opinion about him - he focuses heavily on the personal side of the characters, and forgets the rhythm of the film. That's why, although there are good critics, his films have not caught wide public attention. The ARO follows the same line, but it really improves the rhythm, especially at the end of the film. Frankly, I have grown during the first part, because although the first part gives the necessary information, it is really slow. However, the second part is very wonderful and makes the entire film the best film produced by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
