The only reason for this movie coincidence is that it is on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it even though you will not like it as well as the most famous film. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a rogue man and his companion. The film begins very early, but it becomes more dramatic as Coop first plans to use his daughter to blackmail a large sum of money from his sister's husband but when she meets the girl and see the discipline she will undergo with his brother in law chooses to keep it. However, he faces the problem of staying on the straight and narrow path, so the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley is still able to steal the scenes they have. There is little music in this, and Shirley has only one song. However, this is a fun treat and worth watching with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
