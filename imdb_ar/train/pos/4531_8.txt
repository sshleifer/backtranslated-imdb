This Claver movie shows love through the ages. The film consists of Keaton looking for the love of a lady in the Stone Age, and in ancient Rome and at present (1920). In all three cases, he is the usual cowardly buster who is fighting against Wallace Berry in order to love his lady. Of the three time periods, I think I liked the Roman better although I admit it was probably the most unusual. I liked the scenes with the lion who was obviously wearing a costume as well as the exotic buggy race in the snow - but what I enjoyed so much was seeing all the amazing acrobatics in Keaton. However, all three time periods were a good old fashioned fun and the film, though not at its best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. check it out!
