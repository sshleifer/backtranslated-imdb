It may be a remake of an autumn 1987 story eleven years later, as claimed by director Maple Cheung. Maple employs rock music as a way in this film to express her personal position in life, where love, desire and frustration play very important roles. Rock music may not be the best way to convey deep feelings, yet it is not very appropriate to make use of them because the life of underground rock musicians is more intense than normal life. The director focuses on portraying gentle affection and absolute vanity for life rather than just rock music. Love between father, son, lovers and friends is delivered accurately and impressively through good performance. Mabel does not try to beautify rock musicians as artists at all, but is trying to reproduce real life on the screen, making great efforts of years of work in this project and gathering information in Beijing underground bars. > Daniel has given the best performance in all his films so far. His innate fascination and reservation fits perfectly with the blue temperament of the film.
