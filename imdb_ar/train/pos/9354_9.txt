As a person who never gave up Adam Sandler in terms of talent, like him and many other comic actors like him, I participated in Reign Over Me. I expect a great film, not only because of his presence in the film but because I thought she looked very good overall. Even the person who already thought that Sandler could deliver dramatic performance effectively writes here that I was surprised by how terrified he is. It will make you cry, especially in its sudden and unexpected monologue. The amazing in his role is that it is hard to say that we have seen before. We've seen a lot of emotionally disfigured characters, a lot of mentally retarded people, a lot of singles, and a lot of self-centered zealots, but Charlie Veneman of Sandler is not one of them. They may taste in some ways, but their personality is unpredictable and completely individual. It is a great pleasure to attract the audience before him emotionally and deal with him in every way possible by someone whose problems, mentality and provocations are quite different from most of the characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle offers an interesting performance performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most natural person in the world, so much so that you will not find many characters like him, or at least anyone who is played the way Alan Johnson, whose name is even on the assembly line. Cheadle is adept at being funny, sloppy, intelligent and stupid, as many ordinary people do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors and actresses who have barely done anything in a moment reign in smaller but perfectly colored roles. Jada Pinkett Smith is a very fine middle class wife, Donald Sutherland is a patient but sudden judge and Robert Klein is the smelted Sandler smelter. <br /> <br /> The text of Mike Binder is very impressive because he says something very profound about the wonders of communication in all its manifestations. It is more accurate than Babylon, for example, and enjoys the idealism closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is concerned only with its images rather than just the style. This film surprised me as a kind of response to the kitchen laundry style of the 1970s. Cinematography was popular and immutable, but that was his charm. It was not about our attraction to the camera itself and the glittering gloss that would have diluted its stories that way. <br /> <br /> Music, which plays a key role in the film and its title, is a very powerful one. Near the beginning, you feel like you're somewhere else around the soundtrack of Little Miss Sunshine, but you'll soon realize that you're more than that. In fact, the film is full of a lot of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is a major statement, not only for the community but also for the film itself. It goes without saying that even Blancman's manager is capable of wonders.
