I loved the charming Sabrina Teen and I saw every single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6 pm every night and wait until it came on the Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left high school the show started to fall back. The series must have been best when they were friendly to Valerie (I'm not sure about that). From there, the next series (friends with Dreama) was really good, but when I left high school, it did not seem right. It seems that all the main characters have left, which means that he did not have much of the old "glitter", but the first series that was in the college Sabrina is still relatively good and watch, but when her aunt moves and move Sabrina in their home is just not true. She is no longer a teenager, so the display name is incorrect, and without showing Hilda, Zelda and Josh, this does not seem to be true, especially when Sabrina marries someone who is not Harvey. Thank God, the last five minutes of the last episode came to accompany her. All in all, I still love watching the old episodes of Sperrena "The Teenage Witch", but I think the writers have taken it too far and should have let Sabrina leave high school. Because after this exhibition certainly lost some of the magic
