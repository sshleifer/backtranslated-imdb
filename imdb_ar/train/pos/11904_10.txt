I gave it 10, because everyone seemed to like them and was not supposed to. The reason I bother you is to add a personal note about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Homicidal" and "Tingler" (the version with an intelligent color sequence where everything except black and white blood) several times and "The House On Haunted Hill" several times. <br /> <br /> So I'm not old enough to see them when Castle was on his way to the tricks of a man review, so I can appreciate them for their merit. Although most of them pass it as a second class, schlocky, hammy, etc., I think they do it harm. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Murder" is a real shock and works today - the "The Tingler" hypothesis, while silly, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a triumph. Having used Frank Lloyd Wright's house as an exterior, Vincent Bryce is wonderful and solid actors, plus good grades and production values ​​- when I first saw her in a late-night show in the late 1960s, I produced a reaction from the audience that I had never seen before Since then. <br /> <br /> The heroine was alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading now) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> With no telegraph of what will happen, the camera slowly pulls back, forcing the audience to switch their gaze to ... I do not say more (my "spoiler" above just covers this movie). <br /> <br /> The main point is, I think this trick was accurate - not coincidentally - and when that happened, the full audience said (including the bulk of the guys!) It took a crowd around TEN MINUTES to cool down. <br /> <br /> Now this is the best cinematic industry. A cheerful display man may have been, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned are a good film. Castle Hitchcock may not be, but it was not Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's quirks and forget about TALENT. So I hope this documentary has been recognized. I look forward to seeing that.
