From the excellent representation of very influential actors, to a script that is very intelligently (and highly quoteable), from grand cinematography to the beautiful music of Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers rare film experiences: an impossible experience to find a fault in any region. <br /> <br /> There were several comparisons with Braveheart, which were issued the same year. With all due respect to Mel Gibson, Braveheart surprised me more than the conscious and preaching epic of Rob Roy's competitors as the kind of film I wanted to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy grabs and embraces his tightly revised novel. Do not miss a single scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has an ideal balance between dramatic tension, movement and even humor. Characters are well immersed. They convey the slang and the behaviors they establish in their original surroundings. <br /> <br /> Moreover, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we all see in modern films. <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope Rob Roby will prevail, we realize that his problems are the product of his pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most vile villains in the history of cinema, but there are moments when we can understand how his life events have turned into what he has become. Rob Roy uses a level of personal development that makes his story more believable and more consistent. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a wonderful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword battles ever designed by spectators and a climatic end worthy of all tense anticipation.
