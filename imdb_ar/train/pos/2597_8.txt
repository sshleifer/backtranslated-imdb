Ulysses should not be compared to a novel, it is two different entities. However, the film is still able to preserve the many elements that made the book work, but because it is an optical medium, it is harder to pull the stream of consciousness. I think this is the best film they can make with materials ... It's someone who routinely disturbs that movies are not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the film is still amusing.
