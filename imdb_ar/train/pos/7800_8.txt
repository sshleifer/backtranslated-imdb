I first saw this film when I was 13 years old. It blew me away, and in many ways, is still going on now. But I'm less inclined to see it as a historical piece now. There is little effort to study and interact with racism - and thus fails to realize that the most powerful weapon against racism is its fundamental understanding of those who commit it. What we get instead is schizophrenia - on the one hand, beko and woods in a panoramic 3D rainbow vision - on the other hand, two figures with dimensions are portrayed as an insignificant evil. <br /> <br /> All this makes a great story a movie, but what worries me is that people see the picture as "accurate".
