I was expecting this to be the same kind of mess as it was in the former Blaise Modesty movie, which is why I left it unattended for a long time, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Away from being sequential to silly gun battles and car / boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how to become a pretty girl as harsh as a nail, not to overstate or justify anything. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the budget has actually helped the restrictions: less time and effort has been spent to find even more stupid ways for men to pretend to die and devote more to making the film worth watching. Hell, the biggest gun battle going on outside the screen - and the scene you hear is best for background noise, adding to the thrill - who will win? Who dies? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as great as Monica Vetti, but few, and certainly have all the ounces of the class and fire needed for the success of the character - her face, hair and long slim body could be lifted straight from the comic strip drawings. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a bad Belizean man, he made the character interesting and fun to watch - even pet (and I doubt I would think of dealing with many imaginary psychopaths as drinking friends). I can not think of one of Hollywood's former Hollywood waiters who could have pulled the ball out of it well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Tops always die, in the end (there are no spoilers there!) It's really good, because all the girls who have spent their time sweating on this handsome, disgusting, large piece can now settle Normally for us we are ordinary Valentines.
