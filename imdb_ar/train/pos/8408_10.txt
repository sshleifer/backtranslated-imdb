"It was not me! It was, er, my twin brother Robert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he finally faces Sally. I've used this line dozens of times over the years (nobody has believed it yet). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best films ever for absolute pleasure and unreliability. Stephen Oliver was ideal for the Dogan part, so much so that he was at the Malibu Beach in 1978 with the same character (not nearly screen time). <br /> <br /> Stools! "is another line of age.This classic movie certainly deserves the price of admission.
