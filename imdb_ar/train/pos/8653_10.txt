I just finished watching the movie "California" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You think that with the latest wave of serial killer films, "California" will be in some of the previous films worth mentioning but not do that. Maybe if this movie was shown sometime between 1996-1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" is very different from most of the serial killer films released in the late 1990s. He has an almost completely different atmosphere from most serial killer films today, such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer films have shown a killer, but that person always stands behind the mask or we never see enough of them to know anything about them. The film "California" is a movie that is already trying to break through this barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. Trying to answer questions like, "Why do they do things, do they have something that happened in the past, do they make them feel superior or strong, or do they like to provoke murder?" These are some of the things that Californians are trying to answer but also Leave us room to try to discover things ourselves. Brad Pitt always gives the impression of Grays early. When we meet for the first time at the beginning of the film, we see that it is obviously a disturbed individual. When we see it for the first time, it is late at night. Maybe early drunk. Then we see him pick up a rock, throw it over a bridge, and then land on the windshield of a passing car. House fierce in this film. It's always good to see him play spiritually or really bad people. It is funny that this later leads to playing the real color as in the "12 Monkeys" and that it will be on the other end of the spectrum in the "Seven" of David Venture.
