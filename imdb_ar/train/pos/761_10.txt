I just want to say that it is among all the classic hip-hop films seen such as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin, Style Wars and others ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among other films. When I ask other people about their understanding, BEAT STREET seems to emerge more. But still, ranked the lowest for all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if say, 5 points is the belt). I like musical performances, parting the bric makes me want to turn, and Ramo makes me throw a piece ... Come on, it's a classic game !!!
