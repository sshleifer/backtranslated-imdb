I first saw this film during the International Film Studies course. I am an "unconventional" student, and perhaps because of the years in which I have accumulated or have been worthy of wisdom, I appreciate the slow and inert speed of the narrative of the film. The story is rich in heat and dust in the arid climate, a deep psychological story full of multi-layered symbolism and a clear reflection of the "other" in a land that one does not understand. The understanding that comes comes fraught with memories that are unresolved and the self-being of the outside person. It was produced almost 20 years ago and is a pioneer in a number of other international films exploring colonial subjects in colonial settings, which do not know the nuances of the cultures in which they entered. There are a lot of works that have been filmed lavishly --- and heavily funded --- the works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochina, there is no place in Africa, the two in comparison probably makes Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline infusion or extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and accurate. However, it is a good film worth watching.
