The costumes and make-up were great, and there were some extraordinarily funny lines, and Jim Cary's role was. Carrey did as well as possible in light of the rather disappointing scriptwriting. Sure, this was often a children's film, but if you spend so much money on a movie, you should at least give the story enough body to transcend Dr Seuss's body. I was expecting more from Ron Howard. It is worth watching, but lacks the qualities necessary to become a major classic, by any measure.
