It's a short film from David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it got all the "components of Lynchian"! It is mysterious, dark, indecisive, strange, strange. Before the blond girl starts to talk, it is a bit scary! Exceptional soundtrack to create this strange atmosphere because it is wicked and also mysterious? <br /> <br /> About the same setting, it does not have "traditional" red curtains, but has purple walls, giving it an equal impact. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked up in a dark room crying for help; then another girl starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there because of her mistake ?? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? It's ended without a solution, and Lynch's good movie should end! <br /> <br /> It's a big shortcut, though some amateur acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their representation could have been better in this brief.
