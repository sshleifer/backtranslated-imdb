I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I have not seen any reviews, etc. It was fun and a little 'romp'. I do not know why you did not make a splash more than you did. As the story goes on, I can relate to some aspects of Paul Reiser's personality, and I can see "my father" in the character of Volk. It made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listened to my grandparents too. If you enjoy movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. "Sleeping", in my opinion, is one of those stories that feel good. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal differences, but nothing was surpassed. I would say that the rates are at least 8, maybe higher.
