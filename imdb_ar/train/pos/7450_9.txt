This is the best in the series "Faerie Tale Theater" by Shelly Duval. The Ugly Sisters are a great quality comedy relief, and Ir Arden is the incarnation of the evil paternal wife. Jennifer Belles is doing an excellent job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with the charming Prince Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays the role of the mythical godmother well, although I'm not sure I liked to describe the "South Lady" with some lines. Steve Martin's satisfaction for comedy as a Royal Orchestra conductor is Martin's ideal, but it is misplaced in the show's flow. <br /> <br /> As usual in the series, there are many sarcastic comments made to older children aged 15 and above. With two small bumps, the show flows well and lives happily ever after. Children up to 8 years of age will continue to see it after the parents are finally tired - I've found that the number of impressions is three times greater in a day.
