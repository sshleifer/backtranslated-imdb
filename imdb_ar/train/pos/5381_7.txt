For a low budget film this was really good. I put this much higher than your average film b. Sean and Corinne delivered them in this film, and did not show the camera shy. Watch out for the veil of Jean and Jared. I did not think the producers would think about it, but the contestants deserve it a lot. <br /> <br /> I look forward to sharing Shawn and Corin more in the film entertainment industry. Shawn's personality seemed very real, and the character of Correnne was very erotic and at the core. It is well connected with the sequence of work and implemented with confidence. It was a wonderful idea to imagine Billy Zanni as a clever and clever villain. His on-screen appeal is always a pleasure to see. The chemistry between Zain's character and Zen was good. The work sequences were not full of cheese and they seemed to be connected throughout the film. Of course there were flaws, but this comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good film due to the budget and the fact that it was set up for TV. Shawn and Corwin did a good job considering they were new to the game. I hope that Jane, Jared and the rest of the actors will get a chance to join the stars involved in the success of the entertainment.
