I commend the photos that have tried something different. Many films look like a re-listing of old ideas, which is why I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film was set immediately after the Second World War and appears to be a shortage of rations and post-war to be driving London's "barmy" population. The film focuses on a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They are also tired of not being able to buy what they want but can not see any way out. This is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter formally called this neighborhood as a sovereign state hundreds of years ago! Through this document, they cause that they can bypass all rations and coupons and live life as they wish, because it turns out that they are in fact not British nationals! Where the film goes from there and how the crisis was ultimately resolved, something you'll need to see for yourself. Leave it to the minds of Ealing Studios to come up with such brilliant gems!
