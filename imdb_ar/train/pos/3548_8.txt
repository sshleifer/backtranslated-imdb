I saw this version of the movie "Frank Wes" for the man and the doll for the third time with my mother who has not seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. She thought the Havana sequence where Simmons and Brando were dancing over the storm was excellent. Those were impressive to me and were the highlight of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankowitz, this film that grew up as a story of Donne Ronnon takes some time with the slow rhythm of non-musical scenes at first but it attracts you after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivienne Blaine was not convincing to me but she still enjoyed her charm, especially during the "Sue Me" number. I also love Stubby Kaye's "Sit, You Shake the Boat" and Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a full play, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical but it's definitely a very good movie.
