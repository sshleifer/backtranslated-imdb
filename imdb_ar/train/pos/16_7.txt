I found this romantic story / drama to have a nice end and a pretty general feeling of it. It is not a Holmark Hall of Fame film, where pre-marital sleep was "normal" behavior, but as stars Gene Fonda and Robert De Niro, I was expecting a more rough film, at least in terms of language. <br /> <br /> The most distinctive part of the film is to illustrate how difficult it is to learn to read and write when they are already adults. This is a great subject for the film and includes some moving scenes, but frankly, the film is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's still a fairly light story, and I'd be happy to recommend it.
