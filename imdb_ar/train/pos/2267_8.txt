I have not read the novel, or anything else by Kurt vonigut, but now I intend to start. This holds you from the first frame, and does not leave until the end balances begin to rotate. By taking places you do not expect, the plot is interesting all the time. Speed ​​is fast, nothing lasts long, and it does an ideal job to balance unpredictable fluctuations and allow the viewer to process what we saw. It is good talking and thoughtful. I have never seen a film that I feel I can compare to this in particular. It's intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. The acting is excellent, my nolly shines perfectly, and Goodman once again proves that he does not have to go for laughs, and that Lee and Erkin are committed. Can continue, really ... no role is treated with less than stellar performance. The editing and cinematography are fantastic, and all the pictures are fantastic, with two of those unforgettable and amazing. I will go to other films directed by Keith Gordon, in addition to two other related films, through the author of the books. There is one scene of sexual activity, and a lot of disturbing content and anxiety in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it's not nice. 10/08
