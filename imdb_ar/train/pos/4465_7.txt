ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM music that is enjoyed by fans of this genre, but I will not make it with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musical works by Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kelly and Sinatra play Jo Brady and Clarence Dolittle, two sailors on a Hollywood vacation chugging up a young boy (Dean Stockwell) to his charming little aunt (Katharine Grayson), a struggling actress who works as an add-on to MGM. Although both men are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually expresses her preference for Joe but Clarence later comments with a waitress (Pamela Breton) learning that he is from his hometown in Brooklyn. The thin plot of paper leaves room for a number of wonderful musical numbers, including "We Hate to Leave," and Joe and Clarence's praise for his fellow sailors as they leave the ship; Grason's angry rendition of Gallusi; "Fall in Love Too Easy" A number unfortunately deleted from some of the film's publications), and "The Worry Song", a fictional dance played by Kelly with the Jerry the Mouse cartoon by Tom and Jerry fame. Kelly also performs a kind of fictional ballet to kiss gangs that rival pirate pirates later pirates. Kelly at its peak here, in a strong and energetic performance earned him his only Oscar nomination for the best actor and the shy personality of Sinatra here is very exciting. An entertaining conversion for MGM musical fans.
