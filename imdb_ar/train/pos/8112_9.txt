Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wills make this extraordinary film, with the ambition and the hard field to find today. They predicted World War II, the way Great Britain was attacked, and the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. They change the timing; in the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are many things that are qualitatively correct and spectacular. So we see a helicopter (the oldest film). <br /> <br /> The unforgettable giant planes and the future merit of Roman-looking scientists with bubble helmets: If you can see the ridiculous costumes that the state of architecture may appreciate from a masters of the 30s, Will's vision of a rational society, interesting reflections About the nature of power, John Cabal as a model of adventurous and innovative human forms, who chooses to form reality rather than to be shaped. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspire such a final monologue to John Cabal.
