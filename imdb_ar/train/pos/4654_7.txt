It revolves around the misappropriation of Peter Ostinov, who sneaks into a British company, Texa Kun or something like that, pretending to be a computer expert and security expert. Secretly learns to penetrate the computer, while admiring the boss, Karl Malden, enmity with his rival in the office, Bob Newhart, and the love of his incompetent secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some of the details of the work are somewhat ambiguous for those eyes that are not business oriented, but they are reasonable enough and I have a general idea. Ostinov, Peter Peter, establishes false companies in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses a Texa-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz institutions. Of course, foreign companies are not composed of the same, Ostinov, the titles is a loft for an abandoned artist in Paris, a barber shop in Rome, a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I did not think I wanted it in the first few minutes because it seemed to be on the slow side. I was expecting something faster and more furious, like "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". But this film hints at a good blessing as it comes to appreciate the least important humor in conspiracy, characterization and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Many of the relatively gentle gags may be abandoned, but here are some of the most prominent examples. <br /> <br /> Austinov to Minister Smith: "Let me own these companies." Smith: "What assets?" Ostinov: "Small female donkeys." Now, nothing is made of this small exchange. There is a quick shortcut and no delay for any laugh, which is appropriate because the individual's reaction is likely to be more smile than laughter. <br /> <br /> Ostinov is looking for the magnificent upper stage in Paris. It's covered with spider filaments. The bricks are scattered and some of the plates of the former occupants have been left. The owner does not speak English and Austenov does not know French. Ostinov points to a child-like painting of a naked woman with a chuckle, "Ah, a famous family, eh?" Laughs of the owner also laughs, he responds: "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ostinov: "Oh-Annie, so that's her name!" Owner: "Oui?" Ostinov: "Friendly accord!" (Mes amis, if those are mistaken, je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) In Hots for Maggie Smith is supposed to drive her to her house but tell her he is walking the "scenic road". There is an instant sequence of suggestive traffic signs. "caution." "Lai before." "Give Way." "Yield." Ends with "STOP / CHILDREN" inevitable. There is another montage when the scheme of Ustinov is about to be discovered by the board - foggy on the roof, police cars, farewell from Maggie, ending with a signal: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe more one. I still can not beat Malden as president, and I firmly declare: "I never hurt about decisions", then I understand a handful of pills and wash them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The acting is undoubtedly fine. It's Bob Newhart's best role, for example. He did not have so many, not that his group was not limited, but he is perfect in this part. It is clear that the musical result of Laurie Johnson made a lot of effort. She seems to have written a brief concerto for the nai. Austenov's passion is music and his foreign institutions are headed by fake names such as Claude Debussy and Giaconno Rossini. The president of the fictional Stuttgart is a person named Schmidt, an unnatural Klner. Maggie Smith is beautiful, sexy, bourgeois, and turns out she is not nearly as stupid as she looks. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, in its quiet way, but do not expect comic fireworks.
