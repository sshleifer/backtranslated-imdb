The most famous episode of Colombo by Steven Spielberg is likely to be one of his early films. Jack Cassidy's role should be seen as a killer who kills his writing partner to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will later appear in Colombo. After all, Colombo meets with Jack Cassidy. He is a mystery writer who plans to perform the perfect murder. After his first assassination, his next victim will be the owner of the nuisance shop / widow who will buy him money. Instead of losing more money, kill them. It is very entertaining to see Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's intimacy as Colombo makes him sail after watching this episode over and over again over the years. What forgets television today about the success of the years is that people will want to watch shows again and again if they like characters. It's not about who does it, why and why, but Colombo's knowledge and admiration are so popular.
