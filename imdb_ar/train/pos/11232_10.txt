Well, then the first few seasons took some time to move on with the special effects, but from the start, Hidden Frontier has provided good story lines and consistently good performances, and has always been ready for the mistakes they made. People are advised to see the newer episodes first, so they can see how good the presentation is, and how much they have changed since the first episodes. The cast has a warm friendship and shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> The flow of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with the fans also attests to the show, as story lines move from strength to strength. The exhibition has pushed barriers to the different lines of story - depression, drug addiction, and homosexuality - and this may have rubbed a few people in the wrong way, but that was Star Trek and what was going on around him. He depicts these lines of story in a smart and emotional way, and deals with them skillfully and smoothly. <br /> <br /> Yes, they have used some characters from the history of Trek, but they have achieved justice for them - characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who have not been used extensively in the show, have been reborn in New Frontier books, Their surprise after a while, when Peter David is heading towards the wild imagination versus serious science fiction, HF shows those characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows the public to interact with chat rooms and forums and can identify the people involved. They let the blowers in each episode, so that the fans can see the laughter they have, because they are people who do it in their spare time, with dedication that would make many professional actors in shock! <br /> <br /> This series, now near its end after 7 years, has achieved such limited resources - nothing less than amazing - bringing people together and inspiring others to do the same. HF will live long after its end, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
