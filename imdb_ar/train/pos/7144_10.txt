I've seen the film holes and say it should be the best movie of the year. He brings out the child in everyone. I mean who will come up with the idea of ​​having two boys digging holes as punishment for them? Lewis is cynical. Although the film was different from the book, it was good. For example Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest there. The weight of wisdom and length of wisdom but ZigZag / Reiki was longer and slower / Theodore was larger. X-ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the youngest boys but it was not. The only thing I did not like about the film was that the memories of the past were fairly convincing and long. I'd see more of the present than the past but that's my only opinion. I especially liked the boys' work though. Such as Squid / Alan played by Jake M. Smith was supposed to be a temperamental and difficult child. Jake M. Smith did this and did a great job as did all the actors in the holes. So I would say that if you have seen holes so far, you should definitely see that when you come out again or you will lose complete pleasure.
