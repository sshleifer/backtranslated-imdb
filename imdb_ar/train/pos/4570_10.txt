Even if you do not know anything at all about Ireland, you should love "my left foot" (especially the performance of Daniel DeLay Lewis in it). Christie Brown plays cerebral palsy. Because of this, he spent most of his life renouncing. Even when you try to warn people about something, they just laugh at it. The light in the dark for him is that he controls one part of the body: his left foot. He uses this supplement to formulate and write poetry, leading him to prominence. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day Lewis and director Jim Sheridan performed very well in this collaboration, and in subsequent collaboration: "In the Name of the Father" (but "Boxer" was unnecessary). "My left foot" makes you feel in several ways: sad or optimistic or something else. But in any case, Danielle Dae Lewis made a lifetime performance here. A wonderful movie in every sense of the word.
