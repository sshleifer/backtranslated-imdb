"Now in a sunny climate in India, where I used to spend my time as a soldier in the service of Her Majesty the Queen ..." Thus goes the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which Gunga Din is based. If you're lucky enough to watch this legendary classic game, you'll enjoy the movies the way they make it; Taken from the screenplay of a well-known novelist and poet, this is the story of a humble Indian named Gunga Deen (Sam Jaffee) who worked as a "young monster" during the British occupation of India during the 18th century. The greatest wish is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of the British Calvari band threatened with death by the infamous blood cult of Cali called "Thuggee". Three particular soldiers stand out in this company and are known for their bravery and comradeship. The first is handsome and debonair, Carrie Grant plays the sergeant. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as a brave sergeant. Finally, there are MacShane Douglas and Fairbanks Jr. as a sergeant. Thomas Ballantine. The three soldiers and their fellow soldiers surround a group of mountaineers, led by their fanatical leader, the "teacher" (Eduardo Cianelli). Amid the chaos of war, is the brave boy who hopes to get a place in the army by playing the trumpet he found. A strong story for an old black and white film needs a little bang for anyone looking to enjoy the classic. ****
