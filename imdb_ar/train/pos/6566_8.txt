Have you ever wondered where the ideas of romantic novels and other published articles come from? According to Jake Speed, they rely on real people, and live the adventures they write about and publish. This film is a high quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and light clothing at worst. Language is also not a problem, jokes are funny at all levels. This is a look of Austin Powers on the Indian Jones, without the strange instincts of Michael Myers. I strongly recommend this film to children in the range 10 to 15.
