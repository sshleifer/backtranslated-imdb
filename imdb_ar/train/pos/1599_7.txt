"Moonstruck" is a beautiful little movie directed by the wonderful cashier, Norman Jayson (in the heat of the night, the violin on the roof, the hurricane). The movie is wonderful on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has an impressive love story, and best of all is a fun comedy. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked most about the film was the relative unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicholas Cage seems a stranger to most of the movie, evil ... Well, Sher seems always a little strange. <br /> <br /> In general, it's fun and easy to recommend. <br /> 7.7 out of 10
