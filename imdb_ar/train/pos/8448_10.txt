I've always loved the movie "Murder: Life on the Street," so when I heard there was a reunion film, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Allow me to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the strongest two hours of TV I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but it was a pleasure to see Andre Brager back, because the relationship between Pembelton and Bayliss was always the most powerful part of a wonderful show.
