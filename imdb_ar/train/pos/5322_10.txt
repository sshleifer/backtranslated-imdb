The film is a real dark lighthouse and a very graphic film, a nice story for a man seeking redemption, which perhaps left her too late. Visually, there are some spectacular and technically amazing scenes as to what can be done with the lowest possible budget. Complete signs of Gareth Maxwell Roberts and his team, I look forward to the new project with new ideas although it is hoped that more British actors are wonderful. Lisa Ray looked beautiful and had never seen her before and hope to see her again in the future. All subject to interesting sex, drugs and violence. bring it. I would definitely say to hire this one and check it out if you are in the mood for a quasi-mood fit.
