This film had exciting actors, who did not have a mat on the list of actors, but the actors in the film did a good job. I'm glad because we have films like B, this story is basic, the actors are essential as well as the way they perform it, you do not need a million dollar budget to make a movie just a mix of the list of ordinary actors and a basic plot. I loved the way the street was for themselves, and that there was no other person and what I was interesting was that they did not close the cafe to adjust the equipment and they did it all from the police station. Arnold Foslow and Michael Madsen did a great job of portraying roles in the hostage situation. This was a wonderful film and I hope to be like it in the near future.
