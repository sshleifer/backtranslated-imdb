Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - It's Disney's first animated science adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I like to snoop), but it made me curious for the first time when I heard it was described. <br /> <br /> * - The preview often looked great. It is clear that it was "very hidden" according to some critics after it happened. <br /> <br /> - This seems to be so bad that Disney said: "Screw, let's re-issue Spy Kids." <br /> <br /> So, with all that was said, how is the movie <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm fond of the moving imagination that involves moving music and special effects that are rampant anyway, but Atlantis goes all out. In "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that they are almost the best animated program, perhaps not memorable (except, perhaps for the ship's medical officer), the plot is a bit boring, The conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Here's the controversy that is spreading The "failure" (as in "Just", for example, is about 500 million or something; I know the cartoonists who were killed to see fifteen dollars of this film) compared to the popularity of "partner" and "monsters" I have no idea what the Disney movie will be like ... I do not know what the Disney movie will be like. , But I do not think it is after the picture.
