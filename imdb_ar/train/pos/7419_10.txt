Based on the preview I saw, I went to the "Shower" I expect a sweet little comedy; what I found was a deeply moving drama of family life in some of the most lush photographs I had ever seen. In addition, subsequent meditation made me appreciate the sudden cuts of past viewers (in the arid rural areas of northern China and in the high Tibetan plain): memory does not work much? One moment I'm here, next I'm in a scene from the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> I not only strongly recommend this film, but will put it between the two or three of the best films I've seen in 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, two years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States under the name "Do We Dance?" (Japanese). As with the "shower", the preview did not provide the slightest indication of the depth of the film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit full of funny moments). Is there a fear, on the part of distributors, of the emergence of "important" or "deep" films to attract viewers in the United States?
