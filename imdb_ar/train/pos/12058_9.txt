Awesome horror film gives you chills as soon as you have a loan with him. The atmosphere is very creepy and sleek, and the result is chilling, but the best in the film is the performances. It is rare to be afraid of performances and this powerful film plays an important role in the fear factor. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and draws your attention since the first minutes. Although black women do not have much screen time, they do the necessary things to calm the audience in some wonderful scenes. Dialog boxes are highly descriptive and make your imagination work, and when it becomes really scary. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, watch this on the stage is a completely different but scary experience like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and is aimed at people who want to be afraid.
