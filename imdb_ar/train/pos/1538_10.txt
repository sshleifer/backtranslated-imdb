This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live a few miles from the village where the story took place and I know how things are going on in Sweden. The film tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and the product wants people who watch the film to be more open and care about your friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or any other country) you are likely to get to know this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
