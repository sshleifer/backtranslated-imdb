This was one of the best episodes of all time. The officer, Sean Cooper, was killed in his patrol car in 68. The condemned man at the state prison revealed that he had stolen a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case was reopened on the assumption that he had been corrupted as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Further investigation as a police officer and a human being reveals a veteran involved in forbidden love. This kind of love was a shame and at least something to hide at the time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love I personally support, he was still a policeman and human being should have been killed for that. The audio track was excellent (makes me watch DVR), and the selective use of color-black and white to emphasize one object or give a special feeling to the scene is particularly attractive. I have to watch this one in a repeat!
