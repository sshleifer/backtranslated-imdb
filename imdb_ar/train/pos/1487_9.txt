"Casomai" is a brilliant story that depicts the story of a young couple running into mysterious waters of marriage. The story is very reasonable in the narrative of the alien vision between forgetfulness and constant interference by others, which is fairly typical in Italy (one wonders if these events are different elsewhere). Baffiniano and Daltrey were good at writing, and this is one of the strong points in the film. Representation by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and gripping. The character of the friendly priest is funny and attractive. All in all, the film is really worth and probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
