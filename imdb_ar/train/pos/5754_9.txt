I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight. I must find the characters round, because they left an impression in my mind that went on for a long time after the film ended. In the end, it was sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie again recently and found that the plot was very simple, personal, two-dimensional ... I think it's kind of movies that you can only with the innocence of a small child ... pity .. . <br /> <br /> I recommend this one to all parents you are with young children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can not tell you whether the translation is good or not.)
