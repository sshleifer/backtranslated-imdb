It's a great streamlined film that explores a subject, and gives each viewer something different to take from him. The hypothesis is simple: a famous, unnamed actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to find a future role by visiting a store and seeing people. He is especially interested in the Treasurer in the "10 Items or Less" (Paz Vega) corridor, which finds a friendly, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play brilliantly and attend the solid dimension of characters in a personal study. It is not a traditional personal study; they represent entire worlds. The life of the treasurer lives in a "tough and frustrating real world," while the actor is so engrossed in his imagination that he can not perform simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He easily admits that he puts his face to him when he speaks to people, and shows the full point of looking for real people that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for his work. . We see the reverse process as well. Several characters recognize "he" and point out how he inspired them in his roles in the film. <br /> <br /> The favorite song of the treasurer of "Basar No Barcelona", about how the girl refuses to hide behind the beauty and instead prefer to pay (for example: doing honest work) for the passage of the boat, can not be better chosen. This is paralleled by the character of Vega, the only employee in the store who has any brains or ambition, and is willing to work hard to succeed. (This is a great ambition for someone like Paz Vega.) It's a weird little movie, probably produced equally. If you do not mind slowing down the pace of the "talk" approach, this movie will be amusing. Characters are quite contrasted, and effective behavior makes them gracious. nice watch.
