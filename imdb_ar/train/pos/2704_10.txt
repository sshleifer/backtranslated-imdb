I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation received by this film. Once again, Billy Zan proves that he is more than just a beautiful Hollywood boy in a silent performance that combines the clawing of the spider with the lament of its worth. This film is described as a silent silent film, where there is a lot of music and sound. She has the speed of mania and is full of brilliant creativity that Ed Wood finally began to appreciate. Look at the list of actors, and realize that everyone shines. There is no one just to show their faces. I think they are all in the film to show their appreciation of Wood, and to have a broad physical representation that many have not seen these days. <br /> <br /> But today, reviewers are trying to guess what is going on to become much more successful than what appears in any aesthetic appreciation of a film. IWUETDID does not have a clear target audience. It was mostly made of wood text. Even after his death, his modern social parasites sent him another serious blow, depriving the world of minor classics. This very entertaining and experimental film is really worth living, at least on a DVD.
