But the rest of us, who love a good emotional story and this is the lock to get you to cry .. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Holsey is as wonderful as Dominique, a mentally slow garbage man who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, a doctor who works very long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's agenda, Dominique alone is a lot of time and tends to make dubious calls to judgment. He really just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing, and make his brother proud of him. Stop in the church to pray at some time and express his feelings openly and well enough to make you cry before the film begins. <br /> <br /> Is not about to give up anything here, but the film involves a lot of sad and sad. Those who are not afraid of these things will have days in the field with this beautiful story, their loving personalities and a wonderful song I can not quote here, which has nothing to do with the film at all, but oddly appropriate ... but you hear it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Holsey would be nominated for this film, because it was for Amadeus that I thought it might give him the inner track to really win. There is no such luck. Liotta is equally good but has less emotional impact, but he does later. All I can say about Jimmy Lee Curtis is that she does not have a big part here, but it was good to give her name to a small drama in Pittsburgh for two brothers who will never forget them.
