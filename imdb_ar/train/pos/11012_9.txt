I was not sure at first if I was watching a documentary, a commercial, or a dramatic show. I think that given the production time, it was a combination of the three. <br /> <br /> It is recognized that the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had a feeling that there would be some interesting scenes with the continuation of the movie. We were able to see what seemed to be realistic training systems and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this movie was together for me is closer to the end. The viewer was realistic (at least as I realized) I had not encountered much before. You can put yourself at work and imagine the ideas of young fighters. This was mixed up with the usual problems of portraying acceptable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think the real Japanese actors would be seldom. In 1943 when the war was waged with Japan. It was also interesting to explore the Japanese with regard to the assistance provided by the United States to Japan in the past years.
