It's a great movie for everyone but the youngest, although access to young people has been mixed (at least in the printout I've seen) with some unfortunate English-language ownership! It is almost impossible to guess which part of the film during his time period - no modern technique is displayed, not even the Chinese bike everywhere, just a terrible almost monochrome life, contrasting with the dazzling life of the Sichuan Opera Show and ceremonial fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers point to their impending departure to the theater of war, this may be at any time in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly saw a motor car - in the late 1930s, early in the 1940s - and realized that we were watching China on the brink of massive unrest, and that most of the world we were about to drift into the catastrophe of World War Second and the Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> Making a central person's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions is more emotional. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues of vital importance to date, both within China and in other parts of the world: inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade, for various purposes, in young children; Society is unjust; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> I may read a lot in this film; but I do not think so! I also think it is scandalous not to show films of this kind in the UK often, while slag is eliminated as high quality materials. <br /> <br /> But do not proceed ....
