There are movies, there are movies. Movies are often not just "candy" cinematography, while films are real works of art. Fraulein Doktor is definitely in good standing at the end. As most of the viewers, I was very impressed with the scenes of the battles, but the impact of the central character is what I think is the best quality film. Having done everything possible to serve her as the real daughter of Deutschland, while she was in the throes of morphine addiction, Fraulin's death was treated with great courage by the German High Command despite all her efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is in the back seat of the Mercedes-Benz may be on its own, abandoned and receding, one of the harshest images of many "spies" in life. Only the emotional pain offered by Richard Burton in the spy who came from the cold is approaching. Fraulein Doktor is a much deeper film than one might realize when watching it on its own. I just hope that its producers see it as suitable for release on DVD so that those who have never experienced it before, and those who have seen it again (perhaps again and again) can enjoy this extraordinary animation.
