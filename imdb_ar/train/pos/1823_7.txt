I remember watching this movie with my friends when I was 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I did not watch it anymore. The other day, I went to babysitting and my uncle never saw "all the dogs go to heaven," so we rented each of the movies and saw them together and he really liked them. Many memories came back again to watch this movie again and I must admit I cried a bit. I am 22 years old and the end is still up to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most influential animated films, and I was frankly shocked by this 5.8 rating, and I think this film will bring back good memories to others as well. I admit that the animation was a bit typical but the story is very charming and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog being killed by another dog for gambling, Karps. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to earth with an hour that can not stop criticizing or that this is the end of his life again. When he and his close friend Aichi search for Karvis and spy on him, they discover how Carves gets all his money, and he has a little orphan girl talking to the animals and discovering who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann Marie, and makes fake promises in order to get the money. But he ended up learning that perhaps he should put Ann Marie first in front of himself when Carvis returns to him with vengeance. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family movie, not Disney, but this is an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention that it is very nice and touching. I know it's ironic and some people call me crazy, but this film for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How did they not? They are just love, and I think I will cry again. But anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
