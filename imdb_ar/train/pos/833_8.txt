First, let me say that the director has some wonderful uses for titles in his founding footage. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this film, but I have to say besides Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kenner is very weak. Brosnan melts in this character so well that it is hard to remember that this is the same person who played the bond. As his group and depth illustrate as representative. It is a kind of independent flick and it was really good to see it especially with all the mainstream movies that are flooding the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well placed. The twist in the middle felt like it was particularly good. I also liked how characters literally explode. Often we have in these cartoons of people who do not represent real characters but they mock stereotypes ... I like the different ways that this film follows. I'm thinking of side-effects when I'm thinking about this film but I think this is more viewable and a better film in general ...
