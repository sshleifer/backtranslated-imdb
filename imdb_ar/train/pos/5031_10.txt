This movie is beautifully designed! There are no drawbacks. Not in group design, lighting, sounds, and plot. Text is a call to a complex game where participants have a simple task. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at his best in this role. His behaviors, and the infections used in his voice tones are without error. Each shot done accurately! Surprises appear one by one when the film reaches the first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a very well polished gem. It's not for the simple mind.
