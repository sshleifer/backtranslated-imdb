I myself am a child in the heart, that means I love watching animation, I still do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, it was still my favorite. I thought it was a man. It was a great "new" show on TV. What my father said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember seeing him when I was younger." I admire, "Dad, the mistakes were not so much younger." So I think he's definitely happy for more than one generation, maybe 3. I love this show It's great for kids and adults, well, everyone. It's very funny, my husband and I, in our 20s, love to watch programs, and we do not mind rebooting. This exhibition brings back a lot of memories, those happy ones. I love your Christmas too with Tweety like Tyne Tim, it's nice. I can not choose my favorite character Looney Tunes, because they have changed over the years. When I was young the bugs were of course, Porky and Pig. Baby is great, I've always loved him. In fact, I must say there is all my favorite. I give this offer 10 out of 10, because it is a wonderful show for all ages, very funny, incredible voice acting, and the only drawback is that unfortunately it ended, two decades ago, but a great rerun!
