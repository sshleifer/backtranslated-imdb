Among the three versions of this plot, I love them all, I have three copies on VHS, plus a copy of this version on DVD. There is enough variation in the scripts to make the three games amusing and re-viewed. In addition, has any other film been reproduced three times with all these stars in each? Of course the main stars in these stars are wonderful, but the supporting actors are also wonderful. I particularly like William Tracy like Pepi. He was so wild in the scene that I looked for other films in it. He appeared in many, but most of them are unavailable. As other comments, I also say - buy this one.
