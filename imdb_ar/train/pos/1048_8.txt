For Muslim women in West Africa, marital life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community may not explicitly acknowledge such behavior, but on an equal footing, they may not be ready yet to see it as criminal, a position that can, of course, continue. Fortunately, the text of Cameroonian law is equality for all. This documentary follows the real-life exploits of many women working in the Cameroonian legal system as they try to secure justice for a number of women and children. What stands out (apart from the lively central story) is how, though informal, the courts are actually progressive in practice, if the case is actually purchased. The program also offers a fascinating look at the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which appears (surprisingly horrifying in exceptional cases) to be surprisingly emotional and happy compared to those of Europe or North America. While acknowledging that this comment might be naive on my part, this attitude seems to have been captured in the pleasant, pleasant English they speak. In general, it's a wonderful little movie, and scenes are much more fun than you imagine.
