After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old professional science fiction situation, creatively wrapped in the form of a real original concept - and still can - at all - make it work. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Male actors are reasonably proficient in their careers. Most characters are drawn well, with special signals for the hero and his side kick is more than lovable. Most ring plots come palatable. So what could be wrong? What about the female characters and the ideal cosmetic actresses chosen to be photographed? <br /> <br /> Producers insist on portraying female characters in this almost good series in such a way that the final product seems misplaced. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> All episodes are dropped when the female or personal star appears on the screen. These actresses are all incredible in their roles, and you do not really have to see them to learn that they are unable to perform their acting duties. A blind person can say. Just listen to them talk. They present their dialogue with all the drama and the impact of a 16-year-old boy at a high school concert. Who will believe that these women are PhDs, senators, corporate executives, and doctors? <br /> <br /> In a harsh situation, if producers have the choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they choose - each time? Of course, the chain suffers. so sad!
