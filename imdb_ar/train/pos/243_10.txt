Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is fantastic, all the techniques (especially cinema) are sharp and the scenario is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is as wonderful as Edward '' Ned '' Kelly. He is held as a legendary outlaw, supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All motion sequences are at the point <br /> <br /> The movie is a sophisticated seat element that reaches the end. One of my favorite films from late legend Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of every film he starred in. No one is wrong here. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie in all respects.
