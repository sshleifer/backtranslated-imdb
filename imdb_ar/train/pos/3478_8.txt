These were actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought each episode had a great advantage, and the bad guys had a lot of creative thinking (and even very scary and believable as well). One of the best episodes of "I Left My Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea," "Ghoul, Bat, Ugly" and "When You Wish to Be a Star." If you have not seen these episodes before, please do so. This series was a mixed bag although there were other rings that did not seem to have the same kind of edge for them as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" And the "ransom of the President of Skopje". As with the series that preceded it, it was very well prepared, an interesting story and brilliantly painted. As everyone says though, it would have been much better than without Scrabby-du. The character was exhausted and distracted by the story that was told.
