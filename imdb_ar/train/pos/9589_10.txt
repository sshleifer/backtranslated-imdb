I grew up in New York City in the late 1980s / early 1990s, I can tell myself that this is one of the most important documentaries covered in covering this place in this period of time. La Madonna did not come up with the idea of ​​voting but that's where I got it! Instead of doing violent acts against each other or in violent cat fights, voting allowed people to "fight" in everything less than touching each other (implying automatic incapacity). Seeing this kind of talented / well-run "throw" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from the back of the day here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... All were celebrated with parables of some artifacts Such as the song Malcom McLaren "Deep in Vogue" ... it does not matter who you are or where you were because when you wandered through these doors in this "magic kingdom" somehow, you became part of something bigger than yourself / I was important / most importantly That is to create your movements and your imagination ... and anyone from anywhere can become a king (or queen) as it is. Words and intelligence were as sharp as moves on the ground. All the tension, excitement and magic of the urban energy is captured in New York City in this film. brilliant!!! Please version on DVD for the world to see !!! Thank you so much!
