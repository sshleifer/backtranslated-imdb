It's not easy to make a film with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international managers have met the challenge, everyone is not good, but some are boring. But in his being, "Paris, je t'aime" breathtaking, showing, as he said "love in fact," "love is everywhere," especially in the city of love. Here's a CV (I'll try to make it as free of spoiler as possible) from 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - A kind of tedious opening series, nothing really special about it. A man finds a place to wait for the car, sees a lot of strange couples walking next to him, wondering why he does not find a girl. Suddenly, a woman scares beside his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - Another boring sequence, about three teenage boys looking for some "piece of ass", when a Muslim suddenly trips the girl in front of them directly, and receives help from One of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart to it. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - This was a great disappointment! Although a love story between boys with an artistic background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant. In the end, all that comes after the Ulliel monologue is good, everything before it is just annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - An entertaining sequence of the Quinn brothers. Buscemi - even without saying a word - is enchanting and the whole sequence is just hilarious. This kept me hooked until the end, and that's what made you also addicted to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - A beautiful story too, even if the execution is poor, the heart is there. . It is the story of a Hispanic woman who, in the early morning, takes her child to take care of another child from the suburbs. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - This must be the strangest and strangest part of a full movie. A shampoo salesman arrives at a place like China Town in Paris. If I understand this correctly, the story revolves around inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - A really wonderful sequence. A man meets his wife in a restaurant to disperse her, so he can escape with his mistress. But the wife has some devastating news. Very beautiful, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - Sad sequence as well. Juliette Benoc plays a sad mother. One night, I woke up to hear her dead child. When she arrives at the site, the cowboys tell her she can give another goodbye to her baby. One of the best sectors! TOUR EIFFEL - It could have been two wonderful tunes, but although it has some nice cinematic tricks, the story is not interesting and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - It's really the original and great sequel, one of the best in the movie! A young girl and an old man discuss their future and fear of a certain man ... Quaron is doing a great directing job, and the actors are amazing! Quart de Infants Rogges - American actress (Jilinhal) falls in love with the drug dealer. A beautiful piece again, with the end of very sad PLACE DES FETES - A woman comes to a homeless man, begins to talk to her romantic ... because she loves his life. Beautiful, sad, horrible, romantic, ... Place des FÃªtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - A boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new excitement in their relationship ... Very uncommon and non-romantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - Bring some diversity into the film, QdlM is relief. A young man (Wood) finds a vampire who kills a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Madeleine is dark, frightening and strangely romantic. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - Another part of the descent. Directed by Wes Craven and with stars such as Mortimer and Sewell, could have been wonderful, but Per Lachis is just ordinary and not original at all. <br /> <br /> Voborg Saint Denis - Rumors are TRUE and Twyker's a beautiful short, stunning and well-done film. A blind man picks up the phone, and he hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) that she broke up. He thinks about their relationship. <br /> <br /> Latin Quartier - Although this part was directed by Depardieu and has stars such as Rolands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this part is one of the two. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry among the actors. <br /> <br /> Decree XIV - The last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. American tells her French class about her trip to Paris. Her French language is really awful, but at the end of the part, she realizes that Paris is much more than her eyesight. <br /> <br /> With Feist on the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, do not let me down at all, although some segments bored me with hell, the movie entity is awesome! A real cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
