A tight script, good guidance, excellent presentations, powerful cast and effective use of sites ... <br /> <br /> Paul McGinn offers detailed and accurate performance as a man at the center of a new investigation into a murder that may have just committed a similar homicide from Before. <br /> <br /> An interesting moral and emotional journey takes place with Ben Turner and intersects Amanda Burton's journey. They must pass ... who did what? <br /> <br /> The study of why, past and present alike, rather than WHO may have resulted in the most interesting Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who complains? <br /> <br />
