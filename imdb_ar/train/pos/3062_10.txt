I watched this movie a few months ago on the cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was great. It makes you care about his personality, even when he is doing the wrong thing, and NEVER CAMPBEL performs without a doubt the best performance I have seen this year. She is wonderful as a wise young girl beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just crawling as Messi's father, and John Ritter is fine when he shrinks in the middle of everything that happens. <br /> <br /> I hope this is in the theater because I feel it is a movie that should be seen by a wider audience. This is a shame, because it is best to customize most of the new films that entered the theater now. <br /> <br />
