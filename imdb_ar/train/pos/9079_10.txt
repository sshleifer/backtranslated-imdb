This exhibition will succeed because it appeals to all adults regardless of where they are in their relationship. As a married man 26 years ago, I sympathize with the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but presumably she knows it. I also enjoy his monotonous delivery. Do not get excited or too low. A beautiful band of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night lineup. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best to enjoy it in small doses. It also seems that he is older still wandering around in women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series evolves.
