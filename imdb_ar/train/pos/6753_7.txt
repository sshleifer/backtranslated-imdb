The classic Otto Preminger Noir acts as a lateral heart of the LAURA ... While this film is brilliant and features a high-resolution Clifton Webb, this film has become more frustrating. Dana Andrews is less than a good policeman who accidentally kills a guy just to be installed on a girl's father who loves her. The Preminger application keeps things moving so quickly that blanks in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is fine (less receptive than in the past) and the lovely and stunningly beautiful Jane Turney is amazingly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. Where the sidewalk ends, it must be a wonderful part and a great companion to the Berliner, which is equally transparent (also the Tierney Championship).
