I rarely came out of watching a movie with a warm and happy feeling. I felt like I was out with really good friends, I spent a wonderful time! I enjoyed this movie very much. The acting was wonderful, although I must mention Bill Nye in particular as giving flawless performance. Bill is an excellent actor and likes to see him in more films. Both Timothy Spall and Jimmy Neal are favorites and always prefer to see them perform such a strong performance. Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely gorgeous. The band performed superbly from all concerned. This is a refreshing experience to see a well written film, acting wonderfully and well.
