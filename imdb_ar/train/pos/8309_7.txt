It is always a wonderful surprise when it turns out that the film produced for television was amused like Little Richard. This is a very famous film about the rock and roll story, Little Richard, played by a representative named Leon I have never seen before, but he does a very good job. Like most television films, this is a little tame than if it were made for film, a shame because I'm sure there's a lot to see about Little Richard, who was controversial. Instead we see a lot of religious trash that is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoils a very promising career. All in all this movie is good and the representation is above average in a television movie. 7 of 10.
