This film is sexy, bold, and very good music. Moonwalker was supposed to coincide with Bad (1987). I have an excellent Bad.It (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson showing "Man in the Mirror" on stage, and then shows Michael's history, from his early days in Jackson 5 to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is very good (Badder is a musical video spoof of the bad video video of Bad the Single). It then displays a Speed ​​Demon video. The song and video are really very good. Which then appears. Then the movie shows Moonwalker. After a few minutes, he plays a smooth criminal in a club called Club 30. Like him when he does lean style, it's nice to see you bye.
