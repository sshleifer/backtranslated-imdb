This film is incredibly realistic and I feel it brings great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what is going on in the victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a wonderful job in her role for Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave film. This looks at rape from a different and more realistic perspective than any other film I have seen on the subject. The end is a bit late, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, because the chances of sending an attacker to jail for the crime are about 1%. It's good to see a film closer to reality than it dares to.
