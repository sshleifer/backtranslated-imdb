I did not meet one person (out of hundreds) who hated this film. I bet that anyone who votes on it is a trifling terrorist, or a victim of anyone. This movie has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan ...?" Then go to "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but it's my favorite one directed by Hayao Miyazaki. In any case, this one ranks among the top five. I have seen a lot of movies.
