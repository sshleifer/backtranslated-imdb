A longtime admirer of Bette Midler, I must say that her live concerts are my favorite. She raises her jokes and brings tears to her songs. A craftsman's rainbow of passion and talent, Bette shows us the best of her solid repertoire, as well as the new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Through generations of people offering something to everyone. The only and only Divine Singer here proves she is the most talented artist.
