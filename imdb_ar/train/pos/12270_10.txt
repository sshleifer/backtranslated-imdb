I've searched for this movie for years and it seems to be unavailable here in the US, so I bought a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young fishermen and three of their friends venture into a bear that has apparently killed many campers. What they found was that a former veterinarian in Vietnam became insane (killing some of his victims with a long metal fingernail glove and Freddie Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes on a picnic after a short argument with her boyfriend, and is killed. After a group found her body, they all hid in their tents waiting for daylight. As soon as the sun sets, they all try to get out of it, but they fall victim to one another. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not many bodies, but a few good murders, especially girls death. Men are killed in ways that are somewhat bloodless (blown up in the car, shot to death, or knife through the head). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a great film from the late 1980s. No new, well behaved, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.
