Director Samuel Fuller comes out with a wonderful visual collection: the cocky pickpocket accidentally picks up some microfilm from the women's wallet; it turns out to be a communist courier, now being watched by the police. The Noir Formula movie is all its glory - before the components become cliches - including waterfront languages, birds, saxophones on soundtracks, and one hell of a fiery fight. The performance of Richard Widmark and Jan Peters is right in the goal, and the sharp smartphone scenario is colorful. Fantastic Thelma Ritter received Oscar nomination for supporting knockout role as a "professional stool". Exciting, atmospheric, tough like nails. *** from ****
