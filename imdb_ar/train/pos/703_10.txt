I rated it just 10 years because I find it impressive how an 18-year-old can do with a video camera. It is not epic but very attractive and I never felt bored. If tens of millions of dollars were able to go to the myriad of bad films that were poured together, the director gave the same amount of money and watched what was happening. I know I will be lining up in the local cinema for her first major release. Damn good job, well worth the money. What a Scenario! Budget may be low, but it is more than half the main images I've seen recently. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, whether in writing or on screen. Her serious glory, can not wait to see more.
