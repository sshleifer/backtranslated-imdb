"Holly" is a film driven by the case, but it is neither manipulative nor overly emotional. In essence, it is a film-driven characters, which will not be nearly as successful without portraying the body of Patrick (Ron Livingstone), the soul lost with the progressive awakening conscience, and Holly will strong but ultimately exaggerate the Vietnamese girl. From vibrant websites and photography to even effective editing, everything is clear and true. It may postpone the classical result somewhat at first, but it is a first-class combination and emphasizes the impressive restraint shown all the time. This film, which raises many issues but offers few clear answers, eventually succeeds in raising awareness and compassion for Holly and many who share her ordeal. Glory to those who managed to get it.
