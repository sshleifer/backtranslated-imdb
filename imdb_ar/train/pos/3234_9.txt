I thought it was a very clever movie. I was very happy with it and could not really ask for more. I already have the film because I did not write it to someone ... what I should do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I enjoyed it. Also, the fact that I do not have many foreign films is the first. Now, I personally like Finnish stuff so, which certainly added to how much I enjoyed it. But overall, worth watching. However, if you do not try to understand the Finnish language or read "subtitles" bit, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> Certainly 9/10.
