This was necessary to watch the documentary when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely watching the repetition. I really sympathized with the main character of the film, because this is true, I have a milder condition than the skin problem it suffers from, EBD. This documentary is sad and enjoyable and sometimes about a boy suffering from a terrible skin disorder. Johnny Kennedy talks as a child (because of the loss of vocal muscle) and has never reached puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see his terrible condition, and they take off bandages. Johnny had a naughty sense of humor, so he was told from behind the grave when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and supporter Johnny, Neil McEndrew. He won the BAFTAs Award for Best Editing and Best New Director (Chronicle) and was nominated for the Best Sound Award (realistic) and the Flaherty Documentary Award. He was number 10 in the top 100 TV show of 2004. You should see the documentary!
