My favorite movie is "Imperialism" and one of the best adventure clicks of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold performance and clever fissures to satisfy all of the "movie makers". There are many memorable scenes - the three corporals and twenty policemen who are fighting hundreds of thugs. MacChesney & Cutter Give Bobby Coote a punch ("Save some elephants"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an exploratory"; Din Break a cutter from prison, with a thorn ("What do you think I'm trying to get out of? With the cutter sings and then gets angry, bold like copper - "Well, you're all in detention! "<br /> <br /> I can go on, but it's enough to say that I'm trying to capture this movie whenever it's turned on.For the adventurous and the generals on a chair, it's hard to imagine.
