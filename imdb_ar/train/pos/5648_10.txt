I recently purchased the entire American Gothic series on DVD and remembered it. I was very grateful to be able to show episodes for the first time that were never broadcast. I loved "Ring of Fire" especially stories I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is great because he is "wicked and sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a great player. I thought that Brenda Paki Selena Compass was wonderful in filming. In fact, the whole crew was fantastically talented and had a wonderful chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the network has sabotaged it (in collusion with an increasing body of censorship) because it is really designed. For adult viewing. A combination of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic romance and horror, he has presented great descriptions supported by genius-level acting. <br /> <br /> I had the most tremendous lust for Satan for once in a lifetime. Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck) lives the most spectacular "fallen angel" ever.
