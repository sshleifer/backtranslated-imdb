This long episode contains an astonishing amount of surprises, excitement, ambiguity and fears about the Battle of Sherlock Intelligence against Charles Augustus Milverton, a major blackmail. This is an excellent runtime for Jeremy Britt Holmes series. The usual Holmes gun film is shown as Inspector Lestrade and Ms. Hudson, although there is no Moriarty, only the greatest villain, Charles Augustus. The final twist is sexy. It's a special Sherlock movie, but we find that Holmes falls in love with a server, kissing, crying, and even stealing. This time with the episode "Boheme scandal" with Irene Adler, is the only result that Holmes loves. The best performance of Brett, along with Peter Cushing is the best Sherlock TV, while in the cinema forever Basil Rathbone. Brett plays the role of melancholy, reckless, reckless. Doctor Watson is not a funny, casual and unusual friend of Nigel Bruce, but he is a clever and cunning partner who is well embodied in Edward Hardwick, a perfect interview spot for Britt. The casting is superbly blunt, especially for Robert Hardy as bad bad. Hardy, who is known today as Cornelius Fudge at Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of professional life and has many successes such as the 10th Kingdom and Winston Churchill. In addition, secondary actors are shown with great performances, Nicolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The film enjoys a colorful atmosphere, and the streets of London and 221 Baker Street are well designed. The animated image is produced well by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It's a must see for fans of Arthur Conan Doyle.
