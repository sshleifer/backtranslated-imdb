I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year, and I overcame it. It is a rich and warm novel brought to the screen and behaved beautifully and well-directed. More than anything else, he reminded me of David Lane films, both in his ability to deal with a complex story, and his skills to create powerful scenes that affect you at different levels. The best film I've seen in years.
