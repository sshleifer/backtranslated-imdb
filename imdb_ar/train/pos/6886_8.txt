This is different from any other film, and the closest thing I can compare to is Woody Allen ... But as Woody Allen constantly fantasizes about human frailty, it seems that Brett Carr is trying to figure out a way to get to know her. A state of instability that paralyzes you and tends to define us for better or worse. In the case of le, this is the root cause of stuttering, which can be traced back to the single shock of the child's cover that is exposed through their flash appearance. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of strange nervous people in I think they all deserve a chance to salvation, although the diversity of human personality is what makes the world an intriguing place, so perhaps we should not fix our nervous illness too much We repair our noses or breasts. <br /> <br /> This is a film that was shot on a long bar, but the production values ​​are as huge as the film's range. I feel like a quirky gem for self-help market. I am really looking forward to seeing what this director is doing. After that, I can imagine a career like Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a man explodes like this, he explodes and makes "X MEN" and his humble stadium are quickly forgotten. ... X Men are a bunch of freaks if you remember correctly :)
