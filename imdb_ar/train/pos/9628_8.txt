Some of my favorite films for Laurel and Hardy have a very few plot. Instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and leave them joyful! Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest you can see boys working or cleaning the house. Here in the work of DIRTY WORK, most of the film looks like these two other films - Stan and Ollie are two chimney smokers and spend most of the movie trying (unsuccessfully) to clean up a crazy professor chimney. The movie "Olm" falls through the chimneys, the boys who make the house complete chaos and the crazy behaviors at Stanley, all working together to produce a very interesting film. The subplot is really weird to begin and end the movie. The professor seems to be a really crazy scientist and he works on a formula to make things smaller. Late in the film, I saw him making a duck in a duck and even a duck in an egg! Given that he leaves the boys alone in the room, is it surprising what happens next? While this sub-scheme was not necessary, it was good enough. What worked very well was the middle part. Do not give kids something exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the fun results. One of the best team films earns nearly 9.
