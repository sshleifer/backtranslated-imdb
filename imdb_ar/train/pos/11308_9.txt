TCM Keep me awake all the time ... They continue to come out with movies I have never heard of before ... Senso .... Now Ossessione ... Very early film for Visconti !! ... Wow ... The Italian version of The Postman Always Rings twice ... fantastic !! I have never heard of any of the good people who were excellent, Clara Kalamay, like Giovanna, especially Massimo Geroti in the role of Gino ... What a sensual man !! More muscular and attractive than anyone else on screen in 1943! His look was before his time ... Perhaps many male stars from the 1950s were inspired by that ... he should have been a great global star !! The film is much better than the version of Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and less glossy version of MGM (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner recall this white outfit? Who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and end very different ... I see her watching ... I will buy it !!
