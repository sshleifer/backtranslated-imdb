Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is the most wonderful of all, and there will not be one more gorgeous. It's visually stunning. This aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to produce a good film. This is a great movie. Not only has Tarzan classic halo, but also feel of the continuous epic. We are engaged with white hunters who are looking for ivory, someone in love with Jane, and the other, jerky stimulus may be his character one of the best definition and best examination in the history of cinema. A great flick action stands out as a classic. There is uncomfortable racism portrayed. However, Africans are portrayed as individuals, and in the end, two are more heroic than white fishermen, and so prominently. In fact, the unnamed person probably raises more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. The end is also one reason to enjoy this movie. The Great Lion attack is never repeated, and horror is well associated with the personal reactions more than the modern gore film which will lead to the depiction of the cartoons. If you leave anything outside, it is because I do not want the soil of the picture for those who have not seen it. But this is all you could want in a movie.
