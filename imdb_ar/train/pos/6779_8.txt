George Cuckour directed classic brood and irony. Ronald Coleman is distinguished at his best in this piece of Nawar for a representative who loses his roles. Anthony John (Coleman) famously led his wife Preita (Sien Hasso) away from his intense emotional temper and misguided behavior. But the two of us managed to keep working together to please their fans. Things start to change as John gets bored of his career; reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He delves into a character as a jealous and fighting man. He begins to walk a fine line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role and his life, eventually killing his mistress (Shelley Winters), but he has no memory of the wrong act. <br /> <br /> Coleman seems to be making no mistake in this role. Winter is very impressive as the young woman is determined to stay away from her harsh life. Also in the team: Edmund O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Witt Bissell.
