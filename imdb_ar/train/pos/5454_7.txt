This is one of the most daring films and the most important so-called "Pre-Code" produced in Hollywood during the 1930s. Unlike some pre-code films that sometimes worked on topics that were never allowed after 1934-5, this same film was completely immersed in a very cruel and entertaining plot from start to finish. Certainly, traditional ethics in the late 1930s and 1940s were not clear in this film, because the film revolves primarily around a collusive woman sleeping on the way to the top - and without apology along the way. All of this "broad" sex has enjoyed and used to every man who can help her get rich - something she has never seen in films produced two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Barbara Stanwyck acting in her father's language. In addition to being its president, he is also its leader and encourages her to sleep with a local government official to allow the illegal bar to work without punishment. Although it is not particularly clear here, it seems as though Papa is "renting" his daughter's body out for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after being raped and attacking this man almost by breaking a bottle of beer from his skull, Barbara has enough and heads for the big city. It does not hurt that the girl who exploded and killed her father, but she felt she was beating herself and had nothing to prove she was motivated to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the recession Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge bank. I started out as a freelance writer, but in a period that looked like only a few weeks, she slept on her way from one job to another - until she slept with the bank boss. His future son-in-law !!! All this ends in tragedy, but it seems that the Babs have not yet shaken by the death of these two men. In fact, after some time, I have been able to hint at the new CEO's life and again they are at the top (perhaps in more than one way). <br /> <br /> Now, so far, this is a wonderful film because it was brave and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% social role - a woman without morals or conscience - just wanting to squeeze as much life as she could, no matter who hurt him in the process. However, writers and brave producers "got rid" and thought it was important to deal with a compensatory end. Given that this woman was very evil and complicit, her change of heart in the end was a great disappointment and was severely criticized by the film. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - as again, the wicked person "sees the light" in some way and changes in the unconvincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try watching a woman with red head and frames. The BABY FACE is very much like a woman but does not contain any magical transformation at all - the leading woman is really an attractive woman! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very much like a woman with a red head, roles mirrored and the man plays (John Gilbert) a similar figure. Both are classic and slightly better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing masterpiece for a brief period of Hollywood movies and is often very flimsy, and in this light is worth seeing for Sinefels. Also surrounded by film lovers The Duke - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to see a young Wayne playing a traditional role.
