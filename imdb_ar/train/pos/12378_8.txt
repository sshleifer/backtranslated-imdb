In the hands of a more skilled director, this film was considered a masterpiece of horror. Although the direction of the winner of "Wish Death Wish" is just a grainy clip, the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The script comes out more than horror clich√©s on the back (many of them can not get rid of them)) including Chris Sarandon as a heroine who actually listens to her because she insists that weird things are going down. Borghes Meredith is delicious like a crazy crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner chases young Beverly Dangello as her naive and annoying lover. John Karadin checks on a chair. Watch out for a short veil from Chris and you are unknown at that time! This film is creepy and creative. Beautiful plot transformations, if a boy is predictable. Its climax, of which I will not give any details, is disturbing and impressive. Again, the best director could have done a lot of it, but it is quite satisfactory - at least for those who have the sensations of horror in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> If you like excessive modern imagination and excessive body production, you may have won this love. There is almost no gore. The direction is completely unobtrusive. The effects are few, although there are some tasty make-up near the finish - most of it is not actually a treat ... but maybe I've already said so much already. <br /> <br /> I rated this a little bit that might be justified above its quality, but I enjoyed it just like any 8 movie I've seen.
