This movie is great if you have a chance to see it, you have to run to see it. Although the film has nothing to do with the original origin since 1932, Pacino does a great job of playing Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way of him where he can say anything in any way and make it look great if you think Pulp Fiction was good with nasty words (if you see it), you should also see Scarface to see another angle in How can the representative say it. (It's quite sweet) <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very quickly over time, without keeping the real-time aspect ratio correct, it's still easy to follow, but you must Keep your eyes peeled at all times so you do not lose anything. Personally, I've found that watching this movie makes three hours look like a breeze, it's really wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the thoe films that were well represented and directed so that you do not just do it. I forgot that this movie was made in the 1980s but it actually makes you a bad guy ... "So Say Good Night O bad man "
