This was a very successful and very creative little American propaganda film, openly discussing the atrocities committed by the Nazis before the entire death camps were revealed. Although late 1944 and 1945 will reveal their horrors and horrors, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the truest film I have ever seen in Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the war (the film was produced in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this imaginary world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is not completely repented, and one person after another is the one who reveals the life of Grimm since 1919 in a series of memories of the past. At first, it seems that the film will be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes have been amazingly accomplished and certainly interest you and make the film look like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> In general, the film does a great job by looking at the movie mostly second-tier actors. There are many amazing scenes and performances - especially the scene of the very angry Jewish genocide to the end, which can only make you close to tears. It was also interesting that at the same point in the film, there were some creative scenes that used crucifixes in a way you might not notice at first. In general, it is a must for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film. <br /> <br /> For your information - this does not mean serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was referred to as "the paper hanger". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had earned from money by subtracting a background. This is actually not true - he was previously a "starving artist", a homeless person, and has served well in the German army in World War I. Terrible person, yes, but nothing to do with hanger!
