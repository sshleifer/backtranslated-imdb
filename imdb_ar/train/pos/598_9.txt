Heres a fun fact, you're a child in the movie, one in bed. :) I'm 19 years old now. My parents took me to try out this part, we lived in Texas at the time. My parents said I was crying when I was supposed to be happy and I would be happy when I was supposed to cry. I was all mixed up. A strange and funny fact I suppose .. nor am I a child actor. I livin "San Antonio, workin" in a green area. I graduated here in Texas but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This film is a wonderful movie, although it is a good concept. I have seen this several times in my 19 short years.
