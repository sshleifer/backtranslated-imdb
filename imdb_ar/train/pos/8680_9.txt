Metro Goldwyn Meyer is a very lost player in the short animation market. The market is dominated mainly by Loney Tunes and Mary Melodies, from Warner Bros. But MGM is also capable of releasing hidden jewels, such as "To Spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful season of the year. <br /> <br /> In the environment described here, spring does not spring from natural cycles, but is apocryphal. Who is it? By male elves living underground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they begin to work. They begin by cutting the rainbow rock columns, then scaling them into rubble and using these debris to turn them into colored liquids, which will be transported to the ground and carrying grass and flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the animation depicts spring fabrication, but the second part is slightly different. The old winter man returned trying to extend the winter by destroying the elves. So, from this point, we help in a battle between Elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music you've heard here is wonderfully wonderful. The chunky parts adhere to the head like a spot of ink on a sheet of paper. The second part of the melodies is full of excitement and fits perfectly with the movement. This is just great, Giorgio! Sequence animation is also a delight. The colors blend well and show all the small details in a huge, epic environment. The concept itself is wonderful. The characters' elves, as well as Old Man Winter, portray the cold and harsh emotions of the white season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message listed here. The battle seems to be lost to the commissions in the end, until one dwarf leaps into the movement and leads to the victory of the elves in the winter. So the point is: only one person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a lost classic of the short animation era. What's even more wonderful is that the manager of this cartoon debut here. Who is the director of "To Spring"? It's William Hanna certain ...
