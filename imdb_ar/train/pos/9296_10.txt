I like this film. It's eccentric, funny, violent, surreal, playing in the head of a crazy man, and certainly not an ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find the movie amusing, I think it's not just your taste, so writing a review is difficult. <br /> <br /> For reference, some of the other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (this only happened the second time). There are others, but my taste is certainly unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people do not tend to such kind of things. Do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters in this particular film are well placed, funny verbal humor, interesting attitudes, very good acting (as you would expect from actors), although the representation requirements provided by the script are not as high as Special. The overall package makes entertainment fun, funny, fun and violent.
