Giallo's interesting film reinforces this typical plot but is still an exciting and truly sadistic killer who obviously likes to chase his victims before killing them in hard ways. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who, one year ago, also made "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on it), the film begins very slowly, but in general, does not waste Time with sub-plots or unnecessary sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian joint production, but was shown in Germany by video only in a copy that was cut fifteen minutes from the plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least, the scenes of murder, which satisfy all the wound, are still intact, and the viewer still gets the motive behind the killer. But the Italian version with all the footage is still the version to look for, of course. <br /> <br /> Giallo, a convincing Jiallo with mandatory twists and red herring, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended and slightly superior to the other excitement mentioned above.
