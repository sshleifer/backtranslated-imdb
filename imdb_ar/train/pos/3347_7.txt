Robert Mitchum plays starring with Clint Tolinger in this short, harsh Western film: A Man with a Weapon. Tollinger is a professional tamer city - as when a city needs someone to save itself; it is the person who is brought to do it. Tollinger's latest echoes come as an accident: As he walks through the city looking for his former shot, he stumbles into a town played by a local Western gangster as a doll. But many city dwellers begin the day they rented Tollinger, where his way of cleaning up the town has become heavily taxed (suddenly the High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> The Man With The Gun begins as a strong western film, but it surprises you more and more as the film progresses. What begins as it can be forgotten and run from the mill ends the darkness and focuses on the character. The entire film was filmed very well and the actors were very fun. Mitchum is himself the usual excellent here at Man With The Gun - not one of his best performances, Mitchum still enjoys the presence of a young man and a classic and effective man in a high screen and he hits the lively and purposeful scenes and the shock film directly outside the park. "The Man with the Gun" is the beautiful West Mitchum and he deserves one time easily.
