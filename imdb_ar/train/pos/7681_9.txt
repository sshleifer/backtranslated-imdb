"Sex exploitation" is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I fear that any film on this subject will jump directly into scenes of explicit sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the public. After seeing both "trade" and "holly", one movie took me to really want to see a change in international law. The other felt a bad attempt to force me to cry for five minutes with emotional music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not think turning this issue to a Hollywood consumer is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt it and I should praise Holly's designs for her skillful but powerful involvement with the terrible conditions these children are unfortunately forced to endure. "Trade" between the scenes of serious and stupid scenes with the death of a cat coming after the images representing children who are forced to commit some of the appalling acts. I found this unengaging and sometimes offensive to the case. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not participate in a film about trafficking in children. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to watch a strong film, it actually means something I would suggest saving money on a movie ticket for "Holly".
