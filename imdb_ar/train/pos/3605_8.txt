Girlfight uses a well-known formula as someone pointed out, however, I have seen a lot of movies that do not do it well or are not credible. I think it is ultimately easier for a woman to sympathize with a character and to feel more affected by the film in this way. <br /> <br /> The movie encourages both mentally and physically even if your life and environment are completely different and I think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this. Although it took me five years to start boxing and sports in general, it was only this film that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> So the plot is familiar / common. The actors are good. But the ideas she can raise are what make her above average in my opinion. I have left a great impression on me and I know that I am not the only one.
