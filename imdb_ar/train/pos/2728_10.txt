Simply one of the best at all! The adaptation of Richard Brooks to Truman Cabot's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. A stunning black-and-white cinematography (which should have won the Oscars), and got great results from Quincy Jones and a huge performance by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as Kaklan compete oddly. This film was 0 to 4 at the Oscars and was not nominated for even the best film while Dr. Dolittle was. Go and conclude! <br /> <br /> Although you do not recognize the Clutter family as you know it in the book, it was better to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain tracking process in tracking down these guys. John Forsythe is as impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
