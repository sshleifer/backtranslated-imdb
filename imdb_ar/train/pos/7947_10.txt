I have seen this movie several times through my hood so that to this day I can re-see all the dialogue. When I see him now, he makes me feel happy and still laughing. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they could play the main role of a feature film. However, I watch it now, and noted with regret that it is not a masterpiece I thought it was before. But I prefer to remember my feelings about it when I was younger watching it on the VHS on my grip TV that would cloud the image in yellow. And taking into account that it's a children's film, that's why I'm still definitely introducing it 10/10.
