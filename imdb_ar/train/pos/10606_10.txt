I just finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet little movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" shows. It simply takes you to the lives of people living in a small village in the back of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas performs well like Raymond Tucker, the only young man who finds a child abandoned in the forest. Tooker's research about the child's parents taking him on a trip would have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Leicester, a fraudulent fraudster with a hidden motive. David plays the bad guy to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film than the eye sees. Filmed at a location in North Carolina and with the great audio track of traditional music, it is worth watching.
