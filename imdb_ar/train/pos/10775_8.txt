A beautiful film with fantastic soundtrack that stretches across the rock landscape of the 1970s and 1980s. Radiofreccia describes Gela, describing life in a small village near Correggio (the birthplace of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), and describes the lives and problems of young people related to the world. It is reminiscent of Trainspotting, with little Italian touch.
