This may contain the spoiler, so be careful. <br /> <br /> If there are 200,000 or two million people, is there a difference? I sometimes feel very angry about the apparent indifference of a small number of Americans, but I have to remember that many people here in the United States have not been raised or brought up to take care of anything outside their comfort zone. God helped us what we did. After the relative ease of what we did with Native Americans, and indifference to the horrors of racial slavery, you believed that our hearts and spirits had grown in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But now I see that it is fine as long as our goals are justifiable for us. How then, can we look at any dictator and other terrible government and believe that we are doing a good job somehow to impose our will? We are contradictory and hypocritical, and I am ashamed of that. I feel sad for the affected people. They deserve justice and their homes. If this is done in my American name for my supposed security, I do not want that. I condemn these actions, and I hope our global community understands that many Americans believe that the US government is a deceptive train. No one is above the law. I want my return, as well as the Chagos Islands. No matter what people publish on their computers, no one in his heart can deny that they would not be willing to give up their place of birth to some bombs and helicopter gunships. We can not stand idly by, not to mention the forced and unfair expulsion from our homes. "No one of us, the British and the Americans alike, forgets what is going on around us." It is not a fallacy that a simpler, more natural civilization is less respectful of their rights - and when we turn our backs on fundamental human rights and our dignity for the year 2000, Men.
