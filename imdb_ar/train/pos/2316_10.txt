I watched this movie by chance, by curiosity trailer on TV. I like it when I discover such films, and minor stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, the "man in the moon" has some ridiculous moments, especially in the first characterization of Danny, with its intimate relationship with the innocent and loving. It's really a beautiful and moving love story with three high points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who kept her promises in the film world, the beautiful film of Old Leon Freddie Francis and the wonderful result of James Newton Howard, which is really the spirit of the film. His subjects (which deserve Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have transformed the music scenario.
