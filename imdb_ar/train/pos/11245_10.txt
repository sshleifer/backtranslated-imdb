I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980 and I thought it would be one of "Classic Movie". This movie is a wonderful look at the music industry with a wonderful collection of artists. This is one film that must be within the group of everyone and any film that wants to enter the music industry. I can not wait to be available on a DVD.
