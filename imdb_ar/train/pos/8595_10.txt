I can admit that the script is not good, it contains some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to enjoy some fun. First of all, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland, and Eva Longoria.) Michael Douglas proves that he still gets it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a cheating wife Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria play the dynamic duo, adding their talent Stunning to bet, secondly, this movie is the most fun I've been through for years in Theodore, it's easy and simple, if you want to go to the cinema, a lot of fun to see, the keeper.
