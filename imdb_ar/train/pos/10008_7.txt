As you know, Robin Williams, peace be upon him, constantly shoots his foot recently with all this stupid comedy done by this decade (perhaps except for "Death to Hug", which was bombed when he came out but now is a classic cult). His recent dramas were wonderful, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour of Pictures". The "Night Listener", despite the medium reviews and the quick DVD version, is among his best works, this period. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary story, although it does not include a serial killer or anyone else that is physically serious for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a real case of fraud that has not yet been formally confirmed. In high school, I read a biography of a child named Anthony Godeby Johnson, who suffered terrible abuse and was infected with AIDS as a result. I was touched by the story until I read online reports that Johnson might not be there. When I saw this film, the blurred feelings Robin Williams had brilliantly appeared in my mind. <br /> <br /> Tony Collett is likely to perform her best dramatic performance, such as "The Social Worker". Her role was far from that she had in films like "Little Miss Sunshine". So there were times when I looked at the camera where I thought she was staring at me. It takes a big role to play these roles, and this less important (well-reviewed) role makes Tony Collett one of the best actresses in this generation and has not been nominated for the Academy Award (as of 2008). It is unbelievable that there is at least one woman in this world like this, and this is very scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good dark film I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unstable, because this film makes you feel strange at the end.
