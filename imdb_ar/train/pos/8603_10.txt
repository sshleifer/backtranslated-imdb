The film is fiction. The story line is thin, but it serves as a structure on which some wonderful songs sings and sings beautifully. (I still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people can sing this well.) Some very clever dialogues. Fashion has made me feel like I've been watching a high fashion show since 1942. <br /> <br /> The movies are designed to serve different purposes. This one is designed for entertainment and it certainly does not. If I have one negative comment, Nelson Eide will be so big that it is unreliable. Some close friends made me uncomfortable. But he can still sing and sing beautifully. However, Janet Macdonald was as wonderful as she always was. They make a wonderful angel. <br /> <br /> This type is ahead of my time long, and I'm new to Janet Macdonald / Nelson Eddie's movies and related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love classic rock music that fills most modern films, there is no doubt that this music is simply more memorable, more fun, and better crafted. The stars in this film are more talented than the stars I see in cinemas today. Janet Macdonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I do not know why many other posters apologize for your admiration of this film and in general this set of films. They say he is a historian and tries to explain why he is. And those who do not like it say it is not very good but compared to what? I think this film will undoubtedly be amusing when you forget a lot of other movies. There is a lot of quality in everything in this film because it can not be remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates wonderful talent, wonderful beauty and great music.
