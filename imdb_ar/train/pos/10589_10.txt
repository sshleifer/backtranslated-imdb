I enjoyed Blongstreet, which followed the steps of a successful television series by Raymond Pour, and was meant to rival it. But this offer was canceled after one season because it was decided - I think wrongly - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Bowers Ironside. <br /> <br /> I might add that the demo version of this presentation was especially well done and very memorable. I hope to show a bunch of Longstreet programs. <br /> <br /> The authors should note that this story idea has been explored here only briefly and that much can and should be done to show the play of disability and its interaction on television.
