The last season of the roller coaster russan ride was madness. This last episode does what a previous comment says, it tells us that as far as we think we know the characters we did not know. Roseanne returns to the first season and tells us that this show was a delivery of her life. She says in this last episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he was present. Mark and David married opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As events occurred in her life, she changed her writings. We do not all hope we can do that. Not all of us enjoy a moment of time. We hope that we can use the eraser and change as we wish. That's what I did with the whole episode. In another comment, I would like to say that I do not feel cheated. In my opinion, the family is real. I have changed the way events happened in their lives. A + Ends to A + view!
