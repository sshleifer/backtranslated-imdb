_Waterdance_ explores a wide range of aspects of the life of the injured spine brilliantly. From the little torment of false fluorescent lights that flicker overhead to sexual life, masculinity and depression, the disability experience has become open. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with a mysterious past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are united only by their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, shared experiences, good and bad, combine as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the shifts are those faced by Joel, who initially distanced himself from his sick colleagues using sunglasses, headphones and curtains. While accepting the changes made by his disability, Joel ignores these pillars and begins to involve himself in the struggles of men who share them in the wing. <br /> <br /> The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep his head above water; giving up dancing is a rejection of life. _Waterdance_ is a powerful and influential film on many levels, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
