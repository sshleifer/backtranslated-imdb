I first saw this movie as a young boy and recently bought it on a DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings great depth as Chip Hardesty, the diligent and dedicated FBI agent. His life interferes with the office with his family life, which is not rosy. (Chip's best friend, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton), is killed in a gunfight; Chip's son Mike embodies the Marines during the war. Second World. Through all this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is very exciting and the semi-documentary works effectively. The music by Max Steiner says it all. Sincerity, courage and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country owes a great deal of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI, Edgar Hoover also. If Mr. Hoover's kind of vigilance has been observed, we may have survived the 9/11 attacks, the increase in crimes against children and the many corrupt politicians we have had to endure since his death.
