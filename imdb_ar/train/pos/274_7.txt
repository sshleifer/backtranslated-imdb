I see most of the films Nick McNuso presents, frankly, I love a man, despite his age, he is usually portrayed as a paddy (longtime admirers must note that he is blond for some reason in this click). It is a somewhat familiar film in terms of the plot (but then most of the films these days are not entirely original), but Rick Roberts is attractive as an incomplete husband, Martha McCassack is as attractive as the daughter, and Metzi Kaptor does a good job, Be angry and sometimes hard to love. Nick still has the ability to show both magic and psychosis. However, much of the plot takes place outside the screen - like motivation, past behaviors, good times and bad times - and things that seem obvious to the characters do not make the audience at all (like I). The last scene leaves all that is desirable in the category "but what about ...", and overall, I can not say that I care too much about any of the characters. Having said that, it was what it was - a fairly amusing way to spend the afternoon - and I still love Nick.
