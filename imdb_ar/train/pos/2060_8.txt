This movie is not your typical horror film. It has some scenes of humor and death that can be a kind of comedy. I personally liked the film because of its amazing humor. It is certainly not a wonderful and scary film, which is good if you do not want to be scared and afraid of anxiety. I liked the performance of the humble man and the icester ... very reasonable. I think I'll dye my hair in red like that girl in Scarecrow - so awesome! Anyway, it is generally worth renting for camp humor and a non-traditional horror experience.
