Why does this have such a low rating? I really do not understand it ... Is it because of misconduct? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-budget horror movies? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in those films. People who hate movies only because of bad behavior and bad dialogue should not be allowed to evaluate low-budget films. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the film, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected it to be a gorfist festival, but it is not gorfist and jorney is very bad (most of the time, just brave animals placed on the actors' body and that's lame), but I did not care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, hilarious acting (bad representation is a good thing in low budget cheesy movies), hilarious dialogue (bad dialogue is a good thing in low budget cheesy movies), a zombie rapist with a hilarious huge cock, , But I do not want to say much ... but I must mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates to have sex doll like a live lol! O zombie raider falls in love lol sex doll! <br /> <br /> Best lines in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Coke Coke * Detective Sloan: What Siren * Do * Etiquette? What the hell is snoring? What the hell is it? The ethics of the investigator: It is nothing, it is ... er, cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Manners investigator: * injects heroin into his arm * Detective Sloan: What do you do * Whistle *, morals? Are you * * alert * crazy? Detective etiquette: It is a cold medicine. <br /> <br /> The detective's etiquette: * Repeats a random hit in the face * Detective Sloan: What the hell is going on, etiquette? What do you do? Manners investigator: This maniac was about the demons, and then began to smash his head on the rock! I just started smashing his head on the rock! I think it exists on PCP or anything! <br /> <br /> LOL!
