Two of the war shop workers in a leather goods store were found to be secret lovers because they matched the nicknames of numbers. Within this simple idea and daily settings, Lubitsch produces a rich fabric of intelligence, drama, influence and irony that never leaves. Stewart and Solvan are ideal as a normal couple with real feelings and tensions, and the rest of the sophisticated characters have their own subconscious plots and jokes. In spite of the error that Stuart's big films have overcome in 39/40 (Distry, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith), it is equally on course, and we have a whole set of acts similar to that of other films.
