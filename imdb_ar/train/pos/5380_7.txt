The film is probably the fastest and most exciting series of German films, Edgar Wallace, a cross between Dr. Mapos' films from Yore and 60 pop novels such as Batman and UNCLE. Brings back the outrageous villain from a former film that usually abandons an elegant monk and breaks the necks of the victims with a lethal whip curl. It is in a girls' school full of corrupt middle-aged professors, and with the cops of robbers in jogging at every opportunity, they are certainly a rebound to those politically incorrect times. There is a clear link to a film later based on Wallace, an excellent giallo "Whatever happened to Solange?" , Which also concerns female students who have been damaged by (and corrupt) their elders. Perfectly suited to the subject of the monk, the villain with the Torah in his mind uses the bible gospels here to deal with some of the blows of death, and also maintains a cell full of reptiles to entertain his captive masses. <br /> <br /> Alfred Vohrer has always been one of the most fun and fun directors in the world. The "monk" appears in a hood and a crimson scarlet robe that imparts a high taste to the brilliant white whip, while on the purple night background. There is also a friend's firose swimming pool, which looks great as a glowing entity for novice students and as a mysterious background for a murder scene. Brand "kicker" Hide card "Ende" somewhere in the last scene set is also memorable. There is a wonderful degree of tone and tone for retro music lovers. <br /> <br /> Series lovers will certainly miss Eddie Arnett's character in these subsequent films. Instead, Chief Inspector Sir John plays the clown, convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after studying some night courses. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski also went to bigger and better things. Karim has lost some of their fragile charm at this stage and is now working on the most obvious pop culture level, making this access available to non-traditional audiences.
