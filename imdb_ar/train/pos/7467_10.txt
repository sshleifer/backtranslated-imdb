David Eames is a rich-looking man living in New York City. When Julien Gianni's "sleeping partner" feels very jealous after David falls because of her beauty, Sophia, she enters David in her car and tells him that he is the only man she loves and wants to be with, but he thinks that in love with Sophia she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her , By driving from the bridge. David survived the incident, but left with a distorted face. He is then accused of killing Jolie. The thing is that David does not know what is real and what is not so because he continues to possess these strange dreams (most of them really nightmares) and memories of the past, some of them meaningless. Everything will come back to him soon, even though he begins to know the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there is an all-star star here, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, and Noah Taylor who offers all the good performances in the film. In the film, they all postponed different things from characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. There is also a movie in the film by the wonderful Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a good original film that is different, fun and enjoyable, and will leave you to talk about it after it is over. It is not just a story of excitement, but a true psychological story. The video for the film is really good, but the film is quite different from what it might be. We were very well directed and there were really great sights here as well. All in all, a fun movie to take care of too. Sure, they are making a lot of films "Have They Died, If Not Dead" lately.
