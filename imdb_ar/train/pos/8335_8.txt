While the glittering chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is sufficient reason to watch this film, the supporting actors (including Matau, Faray, Chalop, Derning, and the funny third of Jacoby, Saks and Maher) are additional additions. Matthau shines in the role of Einstein, Fry Ideally as Ryan's clinical preacher, the Schallub line about Einstein's gonads is, as noted, one of the most prominent events in the film. The speech that Rubens casts his first appearance in the audience is phenomenal poetry. Glory to the book to deal with this butter with wit and luxury. I also thought that Keene Curtis was as wonderful as Eisenhower. This may be something like a chick film, but I think everyone will come out of it. Eight points very strong.
