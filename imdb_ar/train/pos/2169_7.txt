Well, first, ignore the last person's review. They admit to sleeping through it so it's no wonder they did not understand what was happening !!! As the thriller / horror movie goes, this film is not so bad, it's definitely a great sight. Directly from the opening scenes, you get a pretty general idea of ​​what will be the reason behind all this madness that follows, and finally you come to prove everything is right. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, it was very strange sometimes, and as old movies go, it was acceptable. Great for late night watching! I give it generous 7 out of 10.
