In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films produced in America and worthy of every prize I have won. It is included in the list of the top 100 AFI programs (though it is very shamefully low on IMDB's top 250 list, at just 183 of this writing) . If you enjoy high-level acting (Voyette and Hoffman are a great match), well-designed sketches, creative direction, editing and filmmaking, you'll love it just as much as you like. Schlesinger paints a vivid and always credible picture of the New York City scene in the late 1960s, and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and survive amidst morality, poverty and despair on New York City's 42nd Street. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking techniques used here brilliantly embody the movement of New York (and the city) underground, which is nothing short of brilliant. I have seen many ideas (including rapid fire editing, dealing with past memories, drug / flight sequences, cartoon faces that slipped through the murder scene to express anxiety and terror) that were stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is treated in such a way as to be regarded as unusually strong friendship or homosexual support. I think that the director has dealt with this in a subtle way not to adapt to the censorship of the times, but to focus his energies on the importance of a strong human relationship in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave and influential film in terms of volume, impact and importance that has not lost any of its influence over the years, so if you do not see it, you will lose a truly American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 10 out of 10.
