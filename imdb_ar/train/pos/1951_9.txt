The single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working in a multi-pay minimum job. When she is expelled, she finds that she is unable to support her two sons (Michael Sitter and Colin Roberts), who have asthma. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. Soon after, drugs that sell them are addicted. Her life collapses, especially when her children, her eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave her. She struggles to recover herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug lords she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie contains some of the best works I have ever seen! Diane Keaton is a lot better, and her personality is crazy but she was very convincing. Is much better for drama than comedy. However, the best performance in the film comes from Michael Sutter, who plays the role of her eldest son. He is as perfect as the responsible son who is still young but tries to be an adult in the family. His acting was particularly impressive in the scenes where his mother confronted drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, does a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching, especially for acting from Michael Siatre and Diane Keaton!
