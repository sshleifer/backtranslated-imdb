How can anyone not like this movie? I think it's a parody of all the old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, see this instead. Michael Keaton has the ball in that role as everything goes. There is one person who speaks English every time he speaks and leads Griffin without a permanent role, but my favorite league must be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hill, Ray and Sixty in this starry movie, which is played by the funniest gangsters from the movie "The Mafia" in the secret funeral.
