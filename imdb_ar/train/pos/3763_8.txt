Now this is more like it! The first film had some unorthodox dialogue and some weaker representation, but the team behind it seemed to gather their own stuff to complement and put up a strong, fun, cheerful and creative comedy that would keep everyone on the edge of their seats all the way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is full of great things, full of creativity, less than a spoof of the 80s at the same time. The scenes in hell are wonderful, as are the scenes in paradise. There really is not a lack of crazy adventure prepared by this crease, and you will not see another film this way. Even the final chapter of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally fond and enjoyable in its highly smiling taste of delightful family bliss. Even Keanu Reeves, despite looking at about 30 years, is not so bad here. <br /> <br /> It seems like a good thing to me.
