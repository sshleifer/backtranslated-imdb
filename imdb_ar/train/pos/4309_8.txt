Lots of comments made by people hit me because I (sorry) lost them. Kasdan wants to offer life, simply, ordinary life. The story is organized in a traditional way, where ideas have visions of changing their lives, then fade, and the music ends, and the film ends, in this big painting. Many characters in this film have such illuminations and then move on. Sometimes they can stick to their views, sometimes they can not, and this is the real way of life. In other words, Kasdan abandons the traditional drama structure in favor of exploring the continuity of life ?? There is no happy ending, but a final end; and everything before it is still in operation, is still always a grab? If you fully insist on a topic, explore the role of the miracle in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for a start. Then add all the random incidents and reciprocal links that make up life, or many interconnected lives, and you have miracles by the Aquarius. Kasdan highlights this subject lightly, rather than insisting on it, and enhances it in various ways, notably the device, directly in the middle of the film, about Mac and his wife lying on the bed, dreaming of each other's dreams. With the ability to shape reality within the film. This is not a movie with an easy or clear message. Just let him play in front of you, then let him sit in your mind for a few days, a month or a few years, and see what happened there. This is undoubtedly the best film for Kasdan, his most mature and most humane film. Consider the great life of one of our most talented writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he has not been allowed to work for several years, mostly due to the limitations of the studio on "Dreamcatcher." Hopefully we will not hear the last of Larry Cassdan. Wonderful film by a great artist. Keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself to succeed.
