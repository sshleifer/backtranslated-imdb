The film was directed by Victor Nunez, who wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Writing nice and direct, she was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, which looks into the daily life of Robbie. What we see is a slice in the life of young Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award as the best female in this role. Ruby began living alone and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical youth search. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film lover, I took the film because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of film, because it does not carry Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Though the stories are quite different, he reminded me of an idiot, staring Paul Newman. The next film is a slice of everyday life for a normal man. I love that. The story is very well written, and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure of is the address. I'm sure there are not many insects, fly in paradise as in Florida. Being allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not my paradise. I've been thinking all along about Florida. Turn to full red boiling. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean as she walks on the beach of Panama City, Florida. In fact the sand is very white. I was there. "It was always a good excuse," she said. "All the trouble about finding a man is no different at all now, who it will be, when and why." <br /> <br />
