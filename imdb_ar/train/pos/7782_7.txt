The photography was nice but I had a hard time understanding what was happening ... Was there a lot of symbolism? ... Golden Fish - Do you mean something in Thai culture? There is not much plot, nothing happens and that's just lame along. No real start, no real middle and no real end. Rather rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get into the characters because you never felt that you knew them ... It was hard to tell which imaginary scenes were real. This move felt chaotic and disorganized. I do not know what the Bang brothers were hoping to achieve. Maybe if you were Thai it would be more logical ...
