I must say that Uma Thurman is the most attractive woman on the planet. This movie was really cute and I mean cute Uber. It contained all the "sex" content owned by most comedian Ivan Retman but with nothing extra, chemistry. Both Uma and Luke have this confusing and reliable chemistry that seems to transcend every scene. Both seem to create this exotic, exciting and interesting relationship with strong "sexual" tension that laughs so you no longer feel your face. It seems that Anna Fries and the other supporting actors are playing each other's roles perfectly, and even Little Wanda Sykes' role will make you laugh. Although this type of comedy is not for everyone, I have to say that I went with someone who does not usually enjoy these films and was laughing like crazy. This movie certainly is not for everyone. Especially younger children because some moments are very few ... well, let's say the extreme to young viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and the hard ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
