What a movie! I never imagined that Richard Attenborough could have had such a film. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, regardless of Ben Kingsley's performance, and I did not consider Ateneboro a good director at all. But Cry Freedom has kept my interest like a few movies lately. It's a thrilling political film with great shows for Kevin Klein and Cheb Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Klein plays the role of Donald Woods, editor of the South African newspaper, endorsed by human rights activist Steve Pico. It begins as a difficult friendship, as Woods sees Pico as a black cosmopolitan who preaches hatred against whites. But with his pleasant words, optimistic attitude and full transparency, Pico wins Woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that Woods knew nothing about. <br /> <br /> Pico is a respected citizen who respects the law and embraces the law and stands against all prejudice and order that keeps his people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. Authorities are trying to raise the matter because Pico has become a huge figure in South Africa. But through Woods' efforts, the truth emerges. But what should be a victory becomes a nightmare only as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. He actually has sardines: first he tells the life and death of Pico. It's a stunning first half, as charisma in Washington is completely dominated by what may be his greatest performance. <br /> <br /> The second half, which is no less interesting, tells of Woods' attempt to escape South Africa to publish a book. About Pico. Woods became an enemy of the state and a banned person, meaning he could not meet people or leave his country. In addition to being constantly spied by the police. Kevin Kline is also performing well in this second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is clear and straightforward, the second is doing interesting things through editing, by giving previous memories of Picot and the events that show repression against black South Africa. Some might argue that this makes it more interesting, but for me in the second half, Woods and his family have taken a bold plan to escape South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minutes were too tragic to cry. The result for George Fenton and Jonas Guanghua certainly has to do with it. Although I have never been a fan of Fenton (I can not stand his grades in Gandhi), I think the result of Kray Freedom is one of the most beautiful movies. The film, thanks to married music with powerful images, sometimes reached an emotional peak. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely a movie not to be seen just because of Denzel Washington. It is a film that I fully cherish. Acting acting, writing, music, editing and cinematography in an ideal combination to create a poem of the power of the human soul. The film deserves a place alongside films like The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
