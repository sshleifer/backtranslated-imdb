Eddie Murphy made me laugh recently at this HBO comedy show. He loved his impressions of Mr. Tee and Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from Honey Honey, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Goony Goo Goo, also funny. I saw it for the first time when I came out in 1984. I laughed hard, I almost dropped on my chair. I still think this is very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh very hard. He was one of the best people to come out of Saturday Night Live. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best performance in standing next to Eddie Murphy Row. <br /> <br /> I give Eddie Murphy Delerious 2 thumbs and 10/10 stars.
