"Goodbye Bird Goodbye" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is very enjoyable and accessible by many audiences. The original film could have been great, with Dick Van Dyke reminding his role on Broadway, but instead messing with the plot, so the film is not very satisfactory. The redesign, which was aired on ABC in 1995, is more fulfilling than original writing, and includes some original songs that were used in a national tour by Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking. > Jason Alexander is a very different kind of Dick Van Dyke, but he is a good actor like Albert, (the days before "Seinfeld", he started in the musical theater). Vanessa Williams is quite suitable for Rose. Their work is also wonderful from Tyne Daly in the role of Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role played in the national tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is not without problems. The main responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, despite her attractiveness, simply looks and looks bigger than becoming a teen Kim. And George Wendt is rather nice as her father, and he somehow aims to figure out the "little ones" away (a member of the original cast was robbed by Paul Linde). <br /> <br /> But overall, this is fun, .
