I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was a bit absent at times, but I enjoyed how the story moved between drama and seriousness throughout the film. This is the second film I've ever seen in Verdone (the other was "Un sacco bello"), and I can see why the Italians find it tired, but he thinks he played a good role as a loving father. <br /> My only fault in this film was that I knew it happened in Italy - somewhere in the middle or south, I suppose, but I felt there was no representation of a place. It could have happened in New York, Boston, Melbourne and New Delhi ... I always think it's important that films have a place to give viewers a relationship. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you'll enjoy it. It is not Fellini or Rosellini - it is not a new reality or reality. It's a comedy story with serious moments that can really happen to any of us.
