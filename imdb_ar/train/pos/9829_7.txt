This movie is wonderful on many levels ... none of them represents the level at which it was supposed to be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just remember this: when you see Shaun of the Dead and other modern zombie movies ... whether good or bad ... this is the formula they use. This is what makes zombie movies so wonderful. <br /> <br /> What makes it better than the best is the story behind the film. Simple Web Search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, this does not take long. There is no point where you think to yourself, "Come on, follow it" ... it moves fast and moves well. This is a little Italian sports figure of zombie clicks. <br /> <br /> Very cool, it's awesome! If your tongue spends too much time in your cheek ... rent it and buy it and love it. <br /> <br /> As a great note: if you're watching it on a DVD, you'll notice that there are sound effects during the menu screen, below the music score ... well ... this is because the music was lifted directly from the trailer ... Which may be the only print that works in that music and which still exist long enough for a ring.
