Ashanti film of its kind in the seventies (1979, accurately). This reminded me of The Wild Gees (Richard Burton, Richard Harris, and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's a very good movie, and I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caen) is a doctor working in Africa and married to a beautiful woman from Ashanti called Anansa (Beverly Johnson) trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are training, one day they are kidnapped by slaves who work for an Arab slave trader named Suleiman (played by Peter Ostinov, for all people). The rest of the film is David's attempt to restore it. <br /> <br /> Michael Caen is a wonderful actor, of course, and plays a very determined character and is ready to do anything to restore his wife, but hopeless instead of a gun and work things. He was first assisted by an English man who had campaigned against the slave trade and no one recognized him as Rex Harrison. Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then by an Arab named Malik (Kebir Bidi). The owner has a result of settling with Solomon (he is extremely strong all the time, a very attractive figure), so he rides with David to find him and recovers Anansa - this involves a wonderful scene in which David seriously fails to get his assortment. <br /> <br /> Then there's a lot of adventure. There are also a lot of ethical questions. The story's progress can be predicted a bit from this point, and there are a few liberties that are taken by planning to move things faster, but all this can be tolerated. The question is, will David arrive in Anastasia before Peter Ostinov sells it to Omar Sharif? (Yes, of course, Omar Sharif is in it!)?
