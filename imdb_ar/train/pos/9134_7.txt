"Purple Rain" has never been a lover of a critic, but a classic cult - and deserves to be so. If you love the prince, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is to see the prince and his abusive parents in himself as he falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many dense scenes which is intimate. Sometimes, it runs in a funny way, but when it works well. Very hit and miss. <br /> <br /> No one can really act in the film. Everyone is one of the Prince's acts such as "The Time" and "Vanity 6". However, it adds charm to the film. When the Prince is on the screen, he lights up and enjoys seeing him at his business peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go and see if you love Prince like me. If you're not a fan, it'll make you one.
