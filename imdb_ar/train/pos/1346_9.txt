As "Quoting" of its best 100 AFI films, the British Film Institute produced a documentary with Martin Scorsese. I admire a huge movie and am proud to see many films. But, I am now in comparison with my idol. In this wonderful documentary film (despite its length), Scorsese moves to scenes throughout several stages of American film history. This is divided into several sections including Western, Gangster and Noir film. Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide and a very enthusiastic professor.
