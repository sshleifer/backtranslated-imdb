I have not seen this show. But, I'm glad I did. Critics this just do not get it! It's one of the funniest entertainment on T.V right now! However, when I interviewed ordinary people, they might seem useless; but put them in the mouths of animals and insects, a laughing riot. I laughed hard, tears were in my eyes. Pig with baby children and her mother priceless. The husband and wife birds talk about health problems, and the male bird who was taking crap after the wife said she was constipated failed me completely! The creature comforts are the most creative offer I've ever seen! Hopefully it will be back next summer when this tour ends.
