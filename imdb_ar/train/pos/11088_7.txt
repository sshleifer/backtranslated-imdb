The villain in this film is one of the bad guys and seems to enjoy what he does, and that's what I think he makes him mean. I do not think most men would like this movie, especially if they cheated on their wife. This is one of those films that remain pretty pretty to the end. But then, there you have it, the end of the dessert that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL" very good movie to the end. The end is the end that we would like to see but not the end of the middle beginning. Then there is what happened. I think you can make your mind around the real end. I left the feeling that only one character should have survived in the end.
