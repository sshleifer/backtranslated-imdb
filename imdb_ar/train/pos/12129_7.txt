This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director but made some good films including the 1937 version of The Prsoner of Zenda. Located in London that Hollywood can only manage, in the atmosphere but nothing like the real thing, it's a manic story and frustrated love, from the novel by Somerset Mogan. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing her on a DVD because I had never seen him before, but I was very impressed with the House of Davis, wanted to see her in the role of one of her first great. So I bought it. Well, it looked good, but I'm sorry to say that the London accent made me laugh. Pitt Davis was one of the greatest film actors, and she did not make a mistake, but she did. It was impossible to take her personality seriously. It was not as outrageous as Dickney's "Mary Poppins" by Dick Mary Dickens, but she was close. <br /> <br /> In the other main role was Leslie Howard and did so in a wonderful way. He was an accurate and intelligent representative. The supporters themselves are doing well. Worth seeing though Mrs. Davis's gymnastics vocal.
