Strangely, this version of "Open Your Eyes" is more mature and more accurate. With the help of a screenplay of the past, Crowe's screenplay has become more rigid and embodying than the original Amenabar film. The Spanish director must get the credit for thinking about the story first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved - albeit slightly. Note that you have no idea what the driver did to open your eyes, but you know almost everything about lead in VANILLA SKY. This is what I mean by more "flesh".
