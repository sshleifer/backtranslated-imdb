Great 90 flick! Parker Bossi is wonderful in this story about Manhattan nightlife that requires a lot of money. Posey performs superbly as a librarian and night crawler. It's a good movie and lit up on a Saturday night before going out. Rock music, fashion outside this world, the text is funny and the actors do a great job. Refund value: You can make it in this world if you try, just look for your right place. I think Barker Bossi is the ideal actress for this kind of personality: young, gorgeous and broken. (You should search for "Clockwatchers"). If you are watching a girl's party, you are obliged to have a good time. Enjoy!
