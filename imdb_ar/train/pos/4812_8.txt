I was initially forced to attend my wife because she was fascinated by the royal families and their history, and she would not go to the movies without me. Although viewers should not expect to be electrified, this film is well made and the visual aspect is second to none. In many ways, it helps to dispel the myth that Victoria was a poor, unkempt woman who usually appears in pictures. She was a bright intelligence and according to the history of her early years, she was a happy young woman who liked the fun. Her love for Albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only counted the number of children you gave birth to (9), you must have an emotional relationship. All this is clear in the film. To this end, the cast was well chosen, with Emily Blunt and Robert Friend performing vocal performances such as Victoria and Albert. <br /> <br /> (ALERT SPOILER) Get shot while defending Victoria. There was at least one assassination attempt when they went out together, but no one was shot. I also found it strange that much had not been done to expand the alleged intimacy between Victoria's mother and Sir John Conroy. It is very likely that this relationship is the real cause of Victoria's woes for both her mother and Conroy. I also found it strange that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as mistaken in romance, or at least having the potential to become romantic. He was already in his late fifties when Victoria reached the throne, and while marriages between older men and young women were common at the time, Melbourne was portrayed as 30 something rival to Prince Albert. There seemed to be rivals for Albert, but she never married until just below her center of life, and Albert was one of only a few that were acceptable anyway. <br /> <br /> All in all I've had worse times in the cinema, and the cake points with my wife can not be too bad.
