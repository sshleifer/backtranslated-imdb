This is a very moving film. I do not care what people say about this film, it's a very good film. Amitabh Bachchan's role as deceased father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to deal with life in the event of something happening to him. Akshay Kumar was wonderful in his role as Adita Thakur spoiled. The role of Shivali Shetty, who played Sumitra Thakur, played a remarkable role. Priyanka Chopra was good in her little role in the film. Rajbal Yadav as a dead brain servant and Iranian Bowman as the frontline leader had a very good relationship and the comedy scene was Farhana. The direction is very good
