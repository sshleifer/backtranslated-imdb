This is the hands down the biggest display stand ever. I've seen lots of parking offers, lots of stand-up shows, and watched the Bet's comic show, but I've never seen anyone who can match Murphy's skills in this show. Excellent impressions, fantastic plays, perfect timing. You can even tell that the crowd has already entered. When Raw did a few years later, it was also good, but this is number 1 in my book. It also shows that at one time, especially in the early 1980s to the midpoint, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show is when the family grill and "Mommommmm !! Ice cream man is coming !!!!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
