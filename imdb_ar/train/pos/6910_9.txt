Paul had been completely separated by someone in the first place and made Dave. It's the same story, not funny though. <br /> <br /> Paul was talking to me this morning about the scene when Sami Davis was singing the new national anthem of Prador. Arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, three planes, a car ride to the group, etc. It was hard to stand up and had to use cane. He was staying in a pigeon-sized trailer. <br /> <br /> He did not know he could do it. Then he saw a crowd of 6,000 additions, paying $ 7. He came to life and shot this scene for two hours. It was wonderful, and then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great man, although he is very liberal. True talent.
