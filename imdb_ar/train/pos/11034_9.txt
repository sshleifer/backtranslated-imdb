Eric Vallet is clearly a talented filmmaker, as are the two men who wrote the script. So Mal√©fique is a big flick, made of a few dollars but also a lot of imagination. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit, but nevertheless I'm honest. So, if you like dark dark movies, go and watch this movie. It's really worth it.
