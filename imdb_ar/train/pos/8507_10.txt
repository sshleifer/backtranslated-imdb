Well, you take OJ Simpson as an American soldier who has turned all the American bus driver who decided to save his driver on his own only if anyone else goes to Artie Johnson in a perfectly straight role as a tour guide who does not know what to do but does not want to admit that she is in trouble She is reunited with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three children who face bad boys and intend to kidnap a heiress and leave a busload of people to die for dessert and do something. And a lot of drama. Everyone was good, but seeing Lamas as the worst bad boys really blew my mind. He was more a believer than an arrogant bad man who not only wanted to kidnap the heir, but raped women and humiliated the man he tried to stop. This was clear long before he planted the image of the good man. And believe me Lorenzo 20-year-old tight jeans trousers you really do not want to miss!
