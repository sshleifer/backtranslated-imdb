The main idea was to make this film, one of the oldest and best color versions in the film opera, accessible to the public. It has done admirably in doing so. The public will not sit without a story about a love story about two strange young lovers in ancient Egypt if they play a typical 300 lb. of more than 40 tenor and a soprano with audio equipment and singing for glorious music properly. Hence the visual replacement of the two beautiful managers (Lorraine Chaplin, Stella Mara and handsome, and Mrs. Maxwell the Slow) who made the story more believable, giving those who were not familiar with the plot or music a better chance to get around in beautiful Arias who might not be. In general, a fascinating introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in middle school and I certainly woke up to the opera, which I did not know very well afterwards. I still take this film with pride and strongly recommend it to those who might appreciate the wonderful music accompanied with better than average pictures. Luciano Della Mara had a prominent position like Radames, and unfortunately for the fans did not appear in any other films.
