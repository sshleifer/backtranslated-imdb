When you watch this movie for the first time, it's hard to know exactly what happened, but in the next viewing, it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Kane was excellent in Bob's role. The character of Lexa Dweig was confusing at first, she was in the trap of Bob, but I really think she landed his love even though she had broken his heart. Dean Ken's performance was usually excellent. He gets better with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film is what happened to Bob and Camilla and the child. He left the bidder to decide
