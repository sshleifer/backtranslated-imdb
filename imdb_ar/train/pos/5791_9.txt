This should be one of my favorite episodes in the Twilight Zone, primarily to portray two lonely spirits in a post-apocalypse environment. <br /> <br /> Shops dotted with spiders and cobblestone streets in this particular way, the twilight zone works best. <br /> <br /> While ideals can be a bit heavy according to current drama standards, it is excellent - using the preparation to provide a statement related to human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is not timeless. The entire drama rests solely with Mr. Brunson and Mrs. Montgomery, who are not disappointed. (I wish them both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A real classic.
