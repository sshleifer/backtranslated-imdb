This film is not much promoted here in Greece, although it got good reps, great script and fairly good picture, and this film was not called "movies" in my country. The film itself is very strong. It is in the difficult time that the newcomer passes when he returns home after being released from prison for five days (drugs). The end is a little sad .... Maurice tries to keep up with his role and he handles him well ... Lambropoulou is gorgeous and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas approached for an extra time of excellence ... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can be made This impression!
