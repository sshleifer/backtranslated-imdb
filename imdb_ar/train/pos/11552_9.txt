Here's another movie that does not need much recommendation. It is a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining, and of course, eventually inspired a successful television series that many would say is better (I enjoy them personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to warm up Jack Lemmon, Walter Matteo, Felix Anger, and Oscar Madison when they were separated on the television show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we got in both cases was four good actors who began to live in real life like their counterparts in films so much that they managed to make these descriptions of their own. It's Neil Simon's comic material that is the key, and where the laughs really come from. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of ODD COUPLE in a way, it is a story of a maniac and neurologist (Lemmon) who was expelled from a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and lives in a Manhattan apartment for his dirty companion And completely irresponsible (Matthau). Inciting these two colleagues is unlikely in the same four walls makes some problems very funny.
