Now here is a movie direct from my childhood, my family was registered; but it got exploited and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this great movie when I saw it as a child, and after watching it again (online), I still work today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I'll always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> When I looked at the opening credits (about who activated), I was surprised that some of the animations date back to the 1930s (WOW!), like 47 years old.
