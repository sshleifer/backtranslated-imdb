The second film Woody Allen in London. Tha Tarot Card Killer Whores in London. The ambitious journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets information that he may be Lord Peter Lehman (Hugh Jackman). She begins in his friendship but falls quickly in love. The playwright was helped by Mr. Waterman (Woody Allen) who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I liked this better than the "point of the game" that has been evaluated since last year. It was shorter and moved faster. The plot is old but I was fun and kept me guessing until the end. It's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comic lines (everything from Allen of course). He is not one of the best Allen but he is much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good most of the time. Allen is bad but he played this character a million times ago and became tired. But Johansson and Jackman are fantastic - they're fantastic and they give very attractive performances. Allen (surprisingly) works on his sexual appeal - there is a sequence where both are in their bathing suit to show off their gentle bodies. The only real opponent is that Allen still seems unsure of how to shoot London. He is not in a standoff position as he was in "Match Point" though - he may improve with his progress. <br /> <br /> Worth watching. Give it 8.
