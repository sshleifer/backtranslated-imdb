Liam Nison depicts Scottish legend Robert Roy McGregor from the early 18th century. He is a real representative. Captures the audience with its attractiveness as it does in all its roles. Jessica Lange is excellent like his wife Mary. Mary is a beautiful woman. It is her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but his passion is what makes her love to smile. They need each other. Tim Roth as Evil Cunningham perfect. One way or another, when you watch a movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. Scotland's scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are well described. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but there is no escape from telling this story as it should be told; no violence is unjustified. You should listen well if you are not familiar with a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this film good is that there is no single actor or actress. They become dirty and actually look unattractive in different sights. It is a skill as actors who attract you. They do not rely on the names of the marquee, the popularity or attraction of the sex symbol. This is something special.
