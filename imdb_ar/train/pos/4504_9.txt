Here I thought that "Nanok from the North" was the last word in the old semi-document "Eskimo". What's wrong! As an avid sea kayak, I stayed up until 330 am to see it in the hope of getting a glimpse of some handmade "leather boats". The film did not let me down. Any student in the construction of kayak / umiak must have a look here. (Note to his SKERS colleagues: they seem to be using the Norton Sound rowing boats with single blade paddles). <br /> <br /> But the film transcends this narrow, recognized interest. Although it was there as others noticed some small counterfeit pieces, the film has so much annoyance that it is just a minor inconvenience. Perhaps (from the point of view of this amateur anthropologist) is the perfect time to make this film. Early 1930s: "Modern" is so new that it (including Louis B. Meyer!) Left the Inuit talking in their own language. A lot is still, though melodrama planted, authentic. They beat this polar bear really, that whale and those who make them. The 1950s version of this film was supposed to be cheese with "stars", technicolor, etc. Seventies version? Not even. Of the very good passages of this excellent film "White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928) geographically, the mirror image of the "Eskimo" also deals with the continuous and profound turmoil of Western culture / technology on unquestioning people.
