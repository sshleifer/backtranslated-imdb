It starts slowly, showing the bleak life of the housewives who decided to rent a castle in Italy for April, but do not give in to it. Nothing happens much, but the time passes beautifully, and there are many ridiculous jokes (my favorite ride is the buggy in the storm, which I find fun). The film is fantastically romantic in many ways, and the scenery is beautiful (like Polly Walker), and the film's accuracy is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberties with the book, and the biggest thing is in the work of Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester, but I actually prefer the film version of this (may be more emotional, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, In any case I like the feelings when it is done well). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a history film during bad weather.
