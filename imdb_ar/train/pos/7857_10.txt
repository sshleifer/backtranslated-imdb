This film does not fail to participate and move, even in 2008, to an audience that is only familiar with the audio and computer technologies that have been produced too much. <br /> <br /> The experience of filmgoers in 1922 who could not see this in the cinema with others on their large screen must be really deep and a completely satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One has to ask whether today's filmmaker can make a silent film for two hours and make it fun and achieve the same rhythm and balance structure like this one. The silent film industry was pure art, and it had to draw attention through its structure, direction, and representation - there was no stuffing with more words or deviations from the computer. Can not access silent or uninterested silent movie. <br /> <br /> This film should be placed in context for those who may be concerned about mentioning Christian themes. This is not a Christian film, it does not sell anything. These themes often coincide with the current ethical standards of this age - the Church, which on Sunday was an ancient national time, Christianity was granted in most families and therefore the film depicts normal life just as it was then. The themes were supposed to be real and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange because of the strong support for good Christian thinking in this particular film (it does not bode for anyone's religion, but only highlights the difference between the hypocrites and the truthful) that the pastor in 1922 was in open debate with A representative of the film industry with a large crowd denounced Beckford as an example of immorality, along with some other individuals who appointed them. New York Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have seen this movie, which was also shown in 1922 and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The priest complained that since the start of the church's film industry, attendance had dropped by 500,000. But the representative of the film in the discussion made the following observations; the presence of the salon also declined, as there were too many priests in prison compared to the actors (fact) and the selection of some examples was not representative of all. <br /> <br /> Thus there was a continued battle between the church and the film industry during the early days of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film about being honest and honest with family friends and being prepared to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, fierce, full of joy and joy, sincere, humorous and silently sacrificed - although she was poor and uneducated she represented the ideal character. However, this is not moved in our throat but it is slightly revealed through the film. <br /> <br /> This reminds us of some modern Chinese films where characters are slowly discovered and a card through a movie is a rhythm that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> Contains the smooth rhythm of the first half that builds all elements of the last section. The last 30 minutes are a great film industry that must be appreciated and achieved without the benefit of the ongoing voice dialogue - it was achieved through the skillful acting and great output. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the movie you did not hear a spoken word, but you felt you had heard everything. <br /> <br /> The support team made great presentations, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Herscholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of the usual humor that Pickford lacks because they go out on the pretext of snow sweep, the balance is almost perfect and ends. This is a special kind of humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied some of Beckford's. <br /> <br /> Another special note about silent films, especially those of Beckford, is that the star often carries the camera for a large part of the film without the audience becoming laughing or bored, with the actors over-exposed. That Beckford is usually the center of attention through most of her films, but people still can not get enough of them are testimony to their acting ability.
