I'm afraid you should have seen a real movie to get something out of it. I'm not a frivolous film like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" Do you know the movie where Riggs is really crazy? It is not a film very similar in the end because it is a beginning. You can run wherever you talk on your phone doing what you ever do and enjoy it in any way. I have noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of film are the kind who will do most of the things except watch a movie and then criticize it because ... duh do not understand it or understand it or what happened. <br /> <br /> Do not let your dog take a shower !!!
