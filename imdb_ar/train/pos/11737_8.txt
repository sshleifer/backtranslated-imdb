Well, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though he was intentionally stupid and was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. Jokes and gags are intentionally bad, but they are delivered in a way that collides with all the correct observations with me. The supporting characters were very shallow and modest. There is a somewhat weak plot, but it works well. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is the focus here. She is loved and wonderful. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that glows in this film. In addition to that acting talent, she had physical features that were amazingly frank. Few men may disagree. The parts that show her character were also some of the most entertaining scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile for her ears from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for comedians, lovers and beautiful women. I hope they have made more than a dozen Elvia films.
