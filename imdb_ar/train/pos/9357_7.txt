In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Feyman (Adam Sandler) by accident in the street. Charlie became a lonely man, muddled by the loss of his wife and three daughters on September 11, while Alan faces problems to discuss his deeper feelings with his wife. Alan keeps his friendship with Charlie and is close to each other. Alan tries to repair Charlie's life, sending him to psychologist Angela Okurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court. Drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is not related to the plot. It may be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, in addition to the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the magnificent Saffron Burrows burrows, in front of Alan. But the family drama is supported by the wonderful performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. It is impossible to identify Liv Tyler, I do not know if she uses excessive make-up to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
