I have stopped giving Mr. Blandings his dream home "10/10 because of the appearance that makes us in the twenty-first century a little swayed: the fact that the black person is the faithful servant (reminds us somewhat of Stepin Fetchit). But otherwise, the film is shouted. A New York middle-class couple (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Mirna Loye) are trying to build a house in Connecticut. This veto has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is the same as usual in his life, while Lowe works just as well as a wife. But Melvin Douglas adds some real laughs as a lawyer for James and Muriel Bell Cole, who seems to have more plans than he does. As for the house itself ... in most parts of the film, you may feel ambiguous about whether you want to live there or not. It also offers builders and contractors and others their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic comedy. He has also starred Louise Bevers, Ronald Denny, Sherine Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robbers
