This film is one of my favorite foreign films, and others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those films as with many great foreign films, is that they take a slice of mundane life and transform it into a deep lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man bored of his earthly life and marital life, she sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out of a dance studio window. The moment his train passes, he captures him. But is it only by its beauty, or by its distant gaze, or by a connection they discover they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has wonderful characters who are unforgettable and have to deal with the painful facts by crossing them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional stereotypes and stereotypes Japanese society, they risk everyone happy and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those magical and meaningful films, which in itself transcends the mundane by showing the magic and the real miracle that life can be.
