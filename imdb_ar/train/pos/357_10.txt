The movie is very interesting with great actors and an excellent direction for James Ives. The movie is fun with a very attractive performance from Stephanie Beachham and everyone is awesome. James Ives has a good eye to cast and directs like a connector that knows exactly when the motion is moving, and then falls to its peak. He does this with an element of humor, lots of transformations, excitement and blood. This is a return to the old vampire film, with lots of donations and blood and screams. The film works very quickly and takes you to characters in a fantastic adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie does not take itself seriously with too much tongue in the cheek.
