"Strange Couple" is one of the films that outweighs its reputation. Everyone knows that, they care about the distinctive song, and they complain about living with a dirty Oscar or Felix, but they exaggerate selling the film without knowing it. This is not just an elegant man living with a dirty man; it's a picture of two people helping each other through the suffering of divorce. It is also funny from beginning to end, but it is the type of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful and difficult situations. So, some viewers found the film somewhat uncomfortable, but I think its strength is in its power. Besides, the face of Bulldog Matthau hits me! My favorite comedy, through Country Mile.
