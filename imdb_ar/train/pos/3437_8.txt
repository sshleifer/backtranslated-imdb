Some kind movies need to be worn. This was an exception. Taken on its own, it's a version of the horror film. With minimal special effects, it can be a psychological study of some kind, with a simple yet existential theme - who collides with the bus, and why? It's not a great movie, but because there's not much interest in it, the story works. Hidden, and everything about the interactions of characters. In fact, there is one competition in the opening scenes, but perhaps it has been put there simply to adjust the tone of what will come. I highly value the energy balance between men and women, and I will not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people interacting with a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some sympathy, appreciate the need for some adventure in your life, and wonder "what do I do in this situation?"
