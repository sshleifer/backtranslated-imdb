Malefique has pretty much a scene from start to finish with its sharp atmosphere. The film is almost entirely placed in a prison cell of about 4 characters. Markus and his small, backward child are the strangest. They soon find notes of a former guest behind a brick that deals with his obsession with the magic and black magic features that lead to his escape from the cell. From here, everything deals with the disclosure of the mystery of the book and his spells to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell to the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think the story is rather poor, and the last development is beautiful, but for me the ends are loosely linked. Anyway, I felt so excited to the last minute because the atmosphere of the film was unique with minimal setup and casting. The murders are unnatural and strange ... It does not require chilling in your spine, and the mysterious appearances are done very well and remind me of hell subjects in Hellraiser. Malefique has a thin, dirty and dirty feeling with a greenish color. Sometimes you wonder if the real or hidden world shown here is strange ... When the retarded child loses his fingers and leaves Linms sucking on Marcus's breasts, it seems normal, how strange to be the incandescent gates of freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique ambience and renders the viewer completely different from most types of shocks. I wish the story led to a more consistent conclusion. There are many elements such as visiting the camera, the other obsessed with books and game dolls that vaguely suggest to the end do not fit the story. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette, although turning it off is seeing that he is making a new Hollywood version of "One Missed Call" that has already been worn and is already useless in the Miike version.
