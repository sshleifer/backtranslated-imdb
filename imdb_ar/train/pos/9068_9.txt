I thought the children in the film were wonderful. I deal with children in this age group, and I think their behavior was very reasonable. She had trouble mentioning the special parts made by the 5-year-old. I did not think the comment was necessary and actually reduced my opinion in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is up and comes as a star. I want to see more of it on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Children in this age group often do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all actors performed this throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that the bullying message needs to be further studied in films with this age group. It's a big problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected. Billy's thoughts were about whether he had won or not won a very sudden bet. How he handled this situation was excellent. Often children today are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
