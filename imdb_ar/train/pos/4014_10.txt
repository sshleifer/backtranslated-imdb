The spoiler for anyone lucky enough to see this movie ever (so it's not really spoiler after all). Watch this movie when it's released and can still remember parts of it. Everything is set in a small town in the west or the rest of that city. More like a ghost town with a small population. Among them is a couple, where the wife is particularly wicked. She allows her man to die at the end of the film and leaves the city but he has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her after that, but before she leaves, the dying man fires at her and then does not accidentally hit her and instead supplies water. She is not aware of this soon and will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny mansion - but that's another story, I do not remember well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really evil woman in the film, pretending to be evil - not comparable to the witch at Snownight, which is easy to tell. The Western is very tight with a few key characters that still suck.
