I love this movie perfectly! I was reluctant to see him at first because I thought it would be very painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, the film "Two of Us" brought me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did a wonderful job portraying what "maybe he was". Idan Quinn was as great as Paul and directly challenged. I was impressed by his tone and behavior. Jared Harris is also very talented and John was very reasonable. My favorite parts were the landscape in the garden and the rooftop landscape - which was very impressive. The film left me with all the sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel is appropriate, given the circumstances.
