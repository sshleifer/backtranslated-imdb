I saw this film at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival, a film not a film because it was clearly filmed by HBO to be shown on its cable network sometime this year. This film features a page as an idol worship and discipline idol and a B & D actress who has enough talent to become a real actress. The page was a little more, and the film deals with some of its other roles in the fashion show but not enough to balance the career of the fifties pinup icon. This film is based on Richard Foster's The Real Bettie Page. I have a book called "Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend" which contains many great images that chronicle the march of the page, and I must say that this film multiplies in the film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of those very famous photos accurately. Mall itself with a black Bettie black wig and brown contact lenses is a Bettie page. Not only the appearance of Bettie Page but also the smile and personality characteristics that came through the camera below perfect. Its body is as close to a replica of the page as possible. Great molding. The story is kind of slave and play and certainly could have been much better. But this is a very good TV movie. I would rate it 7.0 from scale 10 and recommend it when it comes on TV.
