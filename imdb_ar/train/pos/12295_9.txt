"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carney film from 1936-1946, containing dialogues not written by Jacques Prevere but Henry Ginzon. Janson was more interested in the couple Jouvet / Arletty than their lovers, Annabella / Aumont. The latter is somewhat nice, and their story is oddly reminiscent of Edith Piaf's "les amants d'un jour", but the story of chanteuse is a tragic story. What a wonderful day is this famous little world, Canal Saint-Martin settings. <br /> <br /> This movie is dear to French movie buffs for another special reason. Pomeranian Raymond Bramighe tells Raymond that he wants a change of air (Atosphere) because she does not understand the meaning of the world's atmosper, Raymonde's whore (Arlette Magnificent) believes she is an insult and they offer this line, which is undoubtedly the most famous in the whole French cinema: > French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Try the translation: "atmosphere? atmosphere? you got a facial atmosphere? this is our french" no one is perfect ".
