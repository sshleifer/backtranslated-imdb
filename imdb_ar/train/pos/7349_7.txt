Of course if you read my review I have already seen this movie. Raja Babu is one of my favorite characters. I loved the naughty naughty concept with a 24 * 7 server on his motorcycle. Watch movies, semi-characters and so on. I love the scene when it collides with stones and its mouth is able to Khan while eating. Shakti Kapoor also tells a rickety story about Raja Babu's affairs at the dinner table and Govinda, wearing a Dharma-style dress, makes emotional remarks. This is my favorite scene of the film. The "Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon" scene is simply a chemistry between great Indian actors performing a comic scene without any dialogue. Its brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors help each other and still take the scene from each other. Total entertainment. If you love chemistry Govinda and Kader Khan then must. I think t. B. Occupies the sixth place on my list of David Duane. "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", Coolie no 1, precedes the film's jewel. 10/07.
