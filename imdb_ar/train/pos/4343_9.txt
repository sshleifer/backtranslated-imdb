A lovely film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining hands with father and father. <br /> <br /> My father appears on one of the evenings to remember that after more than 40 years of marriage, my mother (Olympia Dukakis) left him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film depicts father and son on a one-day trip to get my father's ideas what happened. With their presence away, girls can play the role of investigators. <br /> <br /> The story tells the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what it should have been, and why my mother complained about my father while discussing their philosophies about life. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and play billiards leading to a close fight. Both men seem to break out of their daily lives. <br /> <br /> The end is down where we learn why my mom left suddenly. Becomes the story of courage and human spirit in the face of adversity. It is not too late to change.
