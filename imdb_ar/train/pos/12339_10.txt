I love Joan. Great performance. Unless they are good. I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre after ... it is constantly improving. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions deserve the entire film. I'm glad to be on the video. I do not know what more you need in a movie. Beautiful woman ..... fortune ..... greed ..... murder .... investigators ... ... trial ..... <br /> <br /> Fashion is very nice. Do you make me wonder what is the budget of this film? I hope they still make films like that. Whenever they try they seem to be making a cheese film. Black and white films still carry a certain mystery.
