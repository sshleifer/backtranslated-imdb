Uggh! I was not impressed with this film, although I must admit that it is technically well made. You get the number 7 to get very high production values, but for entertainment values, they are fairly bad. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films in the 1950s. He won the Academy Award for best film, but the film is sometimes dull with lots of dancing, dancing and dancing. This is because unlike some musicals that contain a reasonable number of songs plus a strong story and acting (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this film is almost all sing and dance. In fact, this movie contains the longest number of songs and dance in history, and if you are not present in this movie, the film will move to you quickly. Give me more of the story! As a result, with exaggerated production numbers and a weak story, this film is like Miring's hard diet - it does not satisfy long-term. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that beat "Desire for the Streetcar and" Place in the Sun "for the best picture! To make matters worse, the" African Queen "and" Ace in the Hole " What is most surprising to me is that Ace in the Hole has lost to the best film in this film - although an American in Paris had no story to speak about and was often led by dance and song .
