Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics to bring back the West after World War II. Director Anthony Mann should take credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart is doing an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire are stealing the film by filming two of the bad guys involved in high-risk poker with Winchester 73 who are in love with the winner. This is a good script with many stories happening at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson in the role of Young Paul. Thankfully, within a few years, we will begin to allow Indians to play in Western films. The film is in black and white and filmed in Arizona Tucson. I will not put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach or High Noon or Shane category, but it gets a higher than average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
