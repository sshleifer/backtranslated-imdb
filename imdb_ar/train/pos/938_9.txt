Although George S. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, but he makes up for it more through his higher and higher interpretation of life for Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Especially effective when Bob Crashit faces his office at the end of the movie. While Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight casts a glowing cloak over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Boosted by Scott's voice, a tremendous roar, the effect is reflected ... much like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror", in fact! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, the same thing that suits you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such a frenzied ferocity throughout the film, it proves the infection. In other words, the "before" scoundrel is an attractive figure like "after", although it should not be. This is what you might call Dr. Smith's influence, because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing this role and many other heavens (theater and screen alike). <br /> <br /> In fact, I myself do not consider Scott's glib anger responsibility. But some may cleanse Christmas Carol. Watch the movie and judge yourself.
