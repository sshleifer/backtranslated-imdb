I think this movie was hysterical. I have seen it several times and strongly recommend it. Mel Brooks, was excellent. The team was great ... I do not understand how this movie gets rated 2 out of 5. I loved it .. I've seen other films of it, and it was also funny, but this movie really is still in my mind because of humor .. I can not say Enough about this film. I'm looking for it to be cyclical but not enough for me. People who played homeless people were also compared to the most extreme standards. Please put this movie more often. I can not see enough .. Leslie Ann Warren was my favorite since Cinderella. I always thought it was not really funny, but I liked it in acting. In this film, she was very funny .. She and Mile have done a great job together. They must put more of his movies on TV.
