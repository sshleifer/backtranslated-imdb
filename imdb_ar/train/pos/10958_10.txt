This offer was incredibly hilarious so I could not stop watching the marathon in central comedy tonight (although I've seen all the episodes previously). Silverman has long been recognized as a great talent, and in the end it is a way to enjoy these talents with a wide audience. I watch this program and laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... Can you do that? This presentation is finally something new and interesting (and more importantly) funny! This is a program I will never lose, a program I will buy on DVD as soon as it appears. You owe yourself to watching this show ... I'm coming a long way in this series ... To be clear, the people who misbehave this offer do not get it ... They may not have the intelligence to understand it ... They must stop making fools of themselves Attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "fanatic" in reference to Silverman, or who claims that it only aims to "shock" ... is elusive ... it is just the opposite; only Google has it and you will quickly see that it is a great advocate of civil rights, . If you do not know that she embraces all these outrageous views, it is ironic that you do not get them. If you do not get it, do us a favor and be quiet so that we all have fun ...
