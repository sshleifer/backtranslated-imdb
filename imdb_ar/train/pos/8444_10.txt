After a nearly seven-year rock road on NBC, it was decided to make only one last installment. The series was on the bubble several times thanks to the lack of numbers that would qualify it to serve as a large block of the TV clock. It has always been a solid hard core of hard wire from followers. <br /> <br /> It looked as if the string with the full title "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a sort of "Mr. In-Between" of the series. It was too much to be canceled, but it was too small for the "Rabid Ratings Ravings" case to end. <br /> <br /> During the period of instability on Friday evenings, they presented some of the best and most famous works of the film every hour. There, I said that artistic and artistic! But please remember that we mean technical preaching, but not false preaching, humming, pedantic, politically correct. <br /> <br /> When it finally happened, it was certainly the end of the line for "HOMICIDE". This super episode was created because this watch was made for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Due to all the events of the past seasons and a review of normal characters, the production team came out and gave us what proved to be a great package. <br /> <br /> Our story? . When we join the story, the commanding officer of the Baltimore homicide unit, Lt. Giardillo, "pulled a pin", retired from duty, that is. But "G" is not really ready for retirement after retirement. So, rather than the oa, we find that Al is the candidate for Mayor of Charm City. <br /> <br /> While in town, making some attempts and campaign speeches, the former lieutenant takes a deadly bullet. Alive, but in a coma, is transferred to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news spread quickly, as if it had been officially summoned. All the Baltimore detectives that we saw at the show were shown to provide their services and help them. There is a wonderful meeting of all these past and present chewing gum during their participation and tracking all progress and the possibility of making progress. <br /> <br /> The product has found a way to deal with those who died earlier in bringing their memory into the story. They have been able to answer some long-term questions and have brought some here to open-ended questions. The whole story concludes the series in a more satisfying and original way. But at least for the time being, we will leave it as "classified." <br /> <br /> At the end of everything in a small and elegant package, this TV movie certainly gets our support. For "HOMICIDE MOVIE" classification, we must give it A or A +, even. However, regardless of the appreciation here, it did not register as a typical weekly episode.
