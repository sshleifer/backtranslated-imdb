I did not set very high expectations for this film, which left me very surprised. The story is a little odd at times but in general I think its credible is acceptable. The motion scenes are fairly nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a little common national sentiment in American films. This may not be the best film of all, but it is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more similar films in the future.
