"If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." This has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of the worst movies, it's good! That's why I gave it seven - everything is fine, but not great. It's a great way to lose 95 minutes, just as the daily talk show is advertised as "an hour of your life you will never go back to!" All the familiar topics here ... Pairs / Unfriendly friends, the most violent audience on TV, women flashing Jerry, etc. Molly Hagan, who usually plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman Head"), was watching Mom play the trailer and Jamie Presley as her equally cruel daughter, providing sexual services to almost every man On its connection. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as attractive heads worthy of what they got. I do not want to spoil or reveal everything but the film plays like a daily show. Here in Phoenix, it is displayed directly for two hours each morning, and then, everything seems to be diminishing. Again, I give this movie seven ... It's good but not great. It is best to take Jerry Springer in small doses of one hour.
