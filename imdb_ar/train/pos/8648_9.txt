California is a movie about Lost ideals. A trip on the darkest road ever. The Way of No Return. The story revolves around a couple who are starting to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny, in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that took place in America and that his daughters - a photographer - will take pictures. So they launched into a series of famous murders that do not know what awaits them on the way. To share trip expenses, they decided to find another couple and put an ad. But the couple who answers it is not just any couple. She is one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive and fragile creature dreaming a lot and loves cactus. The man is just the opposite. Ruthless killer. We learn that early in the film and follow him on his trip to California (not with C as usual, but with K, which symbolizes him as a murderer), along with treachery, murder and defeat in the end. All offers, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes, offer really good performances and you have to take into account that when this film was filmed, not even one of them was a star. Stunning photography, where dark covers the bulk of the film parts, fits the dark personal music of the film. On the whole this is a really good movie. do not miss. You will think again before taking a stranger in your car to share gas with!
