I found this episode one of the most extreme things I have seen in a long time. The creators of South Park have done the best parody of Romero that I have ever seen. I love to know what George Romero's opinion is in this episode, and I'm sure it was purely positive! Keep his true vision of his coma intact completely intact! Most parody deals with pure nonsense without making the viewer think as Romero tries to deal with his films. I think that if a zombie outbreak occurs, we may actually be concerned about the values ​​of our property before our lives as described in this episode!
