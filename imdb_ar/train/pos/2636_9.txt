Lion King series is easily accomplished Disney's crowning animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece in the cartoon animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is BY FAR, the best sequel directly to the Disney-made video, or any other studio, for an animated feature. It deserves a theatrical version. The same can be said for this film. It contains original actors, tunes of John, a fun story, an exciting movement, and impressive personal moments. Everything you would expect from this series. Not a lot of new stories, but padding and extended background on Timon and Pumbaa, are their place in this story. What impressed me most was the interest I received in animation. Mostly, Disney reduces the quality of animation for video and television efforts. But here, the new animation blends seamlessly with the footage from the original movie. The scenes never look out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumba. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillam and Muira Kelly re-represented their roles, such as Simba, Rifi and Nala respectively. So we get a return visit by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. There is a lot of great laughter in this film. If you love Lion King, then you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
