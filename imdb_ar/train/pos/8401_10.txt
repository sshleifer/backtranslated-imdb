The love trap is a "must see" independent film. When I sat down to watch the film, I came with low expectations, but I left the pool. The story is poetic, artistic and creative. The writer draws you further than anywhere else, allowing you to communicate with the real characters that everyone can recognize. The film allowed me to think about my life and what I consider love. The film show what love is really, work and not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and soundtrack of the film. The entire presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
