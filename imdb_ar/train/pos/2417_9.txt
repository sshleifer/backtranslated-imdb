"Going Berserk" is actually one of the most popular candy films I have ever seen. Sure, it's a fairly low budget, but it's a non-stop comic tour. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his father-in-law asks him soon to be the amount he earns, Kandy says, "Oh, I drop anywhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Of course, it's the delivery of the candy he sells. Classic stuff only. Eugene Levy also turns into a hilarious performance as a film director. A clip from his awesome low-budget film "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So, if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie enough.
