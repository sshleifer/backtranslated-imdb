I saw the film and I really can not stop my tears. It is a tragedy that India does not have such leaders after freedom, who dare to achieve justice with their children, when they do not act properly .. In the current generation, politicians enter their children in politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi " Society we want to create / make with these people (around Harrel)? " No wonder it would be a dream that India would hardly have such a leader in this generation or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said of Gandhi: "After 50 years, one hardly believes that this person has the body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) who lived on this earth." I sincerely want to thank LOT Anil Kapoor and Fairuz Khan and all the actors / actresses in this wonderful film For a wonderful person and a relationship with his son, each father and son must watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
