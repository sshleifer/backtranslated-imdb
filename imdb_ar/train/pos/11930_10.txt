This movie was good I am not a baseball fan, but this movie was created to help understand the meaning of love, design, heart and so on. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. have a variety of talented actors and an understanding of the sport. The plot was reasonable, I love the message. William Dear and the men put a great film. <br /> <br /> Most sports movies revolve around real stories or events, and often do not work well. But this movie reaches 10 on a perfect scale, although there are some minor errors here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
