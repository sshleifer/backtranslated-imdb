My constant love for the Italian actress Luciana Balozi, who helped start her adulthood in 1965's "Thunderball", led me to some rather unusual places. One example is this British curiosity since 1959, "Carlton Brown of FO." , Which introduces Luciana in one of her previous roles. She plays the role of Princess in this picture, although the picture is in fact a display of Tali Thomas's talents and Peter Sellers, both of whom were sure to have his stars rise at this stage. In this funny and often funny film, we get to know the island of Gillardia, which resembles the island of Madeira, which was a British colony until 1916 and then forgotten internationally. Forty-four years later, it became the center of global interest and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits were discovered there, and Her Majesty Carlton Brown of the State Department was sent to assume the post. Terry Thomas supports this part well, as Sellers does in his role as Prime Minister Ambipolos in the small country. (This was the second Sellers of 1959 film about a small state that corresponds to intelligence and the world, and the other film is "The Mouse That Roared", of course.) Ian Bannen steals almost the show here as the Dark King of Garardia, and Lucianta's attractive daughter can also Be in its simple role. The film shows a lot in the way of very dry humor, although there is some laughter from the abdominal area (the reception at Gailardian airport, for example, especially in the May-May procession of the Gaillardian power). The vulgar Celeras prime minister, with his cracked English spots and permanent sweat stains, is another unforgettable figure in the gods of the great actor. Despite its occasional idyllicness or two unbreakable, highly thorny British statues, this picture has been found for a mediocre, winning entertainment, and well presented on this magnificent Anchor Bay DVD.
