8 Simple rules for dating My teenage daughter had a good start. Tom Shadiak, the project's top talent, participated. This means that comedy will not be less exciting, and that's exactly what happened: The show remains one of the latest, most entertaining and brightest shows in a very long time. Each line, facial expressions, choice of choice, scene, wander all of perfection. There was not a single episode after which I thought, "Man was not as good as the rest." Each one was the highlight. Again, this is the perfect kind that we expect from Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film), Professor Nutty (first) and Liar Liar. His autobiography. It is a product here and not a way out, but its magical touch is felt in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): It can be nice and somewhat nervous. From time to time, he works as a sports writer. John died unfortunately in 2003, leaving his stunning memory and almost certain contemplation of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Mother: Kate (Katie Sagal): Come on, who did not fall in love with Kitty when she played the Wedge on a married couple with children? Bondi was our hero. We have shown him the respect and love that he has never loved. But without Peg's non-mindless and casual lifestyle, Al may have been just another dad in Chicago instead of the chaos caused by Peg (life, in fact). Katey was then MILF and still: a fortune now (instead of redhead) and just as always. Kate is a conservative mom and loving wife. I know this sounds boring, but comedy, fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played perfectly by Kaley Cuoco): Never played a naughty role well. Apart from Gob on Arrested Development, Bridget may be a suitable shoe for any prizes awarded to this original model. Bridget is shallow, self-centered, not too bright and small in his view. She plays the role of dumb blonde better than anyone at all IMO. Perfect. One of the most important points in the program. <br /> <br /> Daughter's obsessed with being overlooked: Kerry (Amy Davidson): She is a glamor and joker, and gets no love from life or circumstances. He feels tolerated, underestimated and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (actually older than her) and causes very contradictory personalities and brains to never-ending confrontations, largely from our amusement. <br /> <br /> Jr.: Rory (Martin Spangers): The second was IMO's most character before Ritter's death, then John passes, and new characters come and Rory is not the maker of the witty verbal problems he is accustomed to: that mostly went to the character of David Speed . <br /> <br /> These characters were the main characters of John Ritter's time. Unfortunately, Larry Miller's fun funny (one favorite) did not get much of the screen time. Paul played his co-worker / competitor. After the autopsy of the aorta Ritter cost his life in 2003 (September 11), the show was in a state of suspension for a while. No one thought it could come back, but it happened later, with the addition of new additions. This second phase of the show began, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> The strict and confident school principal: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there in talk shows. This was the first time I saw him do anything. I am the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sad that he did not attend earlier. He also plays the attention of potential love to Kate after Paul passes through. Gradual progress towards this point (which at first seemed crazy) earns a lot of praise for the creators. It was done slowly, carefully and with privilege, with the continued respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> The Attitude Grandpa: Jim Egan (James Garner): It's a welcome addition to the series, and it was an old-fashioned 'never-ending' cannon cannon, essentially by ... <br /> <br> /> 35-year-old brother of a non-unemployed mother: CJ (played with madly funny heights by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I did not know it was funny. In a way, the presence of a very fashionable Spade is recognized within his character (unlike detachable personality), which is understandable, since he is comedic and in a comedic show. This strange feeling is somewhat like seeing someone borrow a lot of material from David Spade in films, talk shows, awards, etc., and provide a great representation of Spade voice and comedy style, but IS Spade. I mean, you realize that he is not trying to play someone else, or a completely new character: he is a ridiculous and ridiculous figure we knew, and he takes this joyful comic formula to the absolute top. Every line uttered, every derision generated, all classics, literally. It was a funny spade. So, very funny. <br /> <br /> Both drama and drama faculties were high after the show returned, but audiences thought, "John has passed, he will not be himself anymore." This is understandable, since we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who have been given a "Dear Yes" free trip but have caused the cancellation of Andy Richter Controls the Universe at any time. As supply quality increased, ratings declined. Soon it was no more, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> You've saved the best for the last: fans are married with children they are in therapy. And boy, what a treat it was. I still tremble just remember it. It is such a good surprise that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if it did so legitimately under the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice it to say that it is something you will never forget. I know I will not :-)
