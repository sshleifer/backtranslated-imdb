Must see for those who love photography. Stunning and stunning, leaving you in the ore. I saw him twice in the cinema and now on the DVD. It was good on the DVD, but on the big screen, that was something else. <br /> <br /> My daughter asked to see it and loved it, the older one finally screamed. But it was she who wanted to see her again tonight when she saw her at the video store. His petty love of nature, especially the fox, is well told. In some respects, he reminded me of the bear in his story, not a documentary. Which works for children very well. Not preaching is very important, you put your mind in mind. <br /> <br /> But the star of this film is cinematographers, how they did what they did. Amazing just amazing.
