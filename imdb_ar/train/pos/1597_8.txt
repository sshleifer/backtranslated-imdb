This is the kind of movie that appeared on a snowy Sunday, where the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you step into a large armchair and companion for a few hours. Great offers from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) are nicely presented. There are no slopes to cross, no dangerous waters, just a clever warm paddle in New York life at its best. A family film in every sense of the word and worthy of praise.
