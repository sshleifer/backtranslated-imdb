I used this film in a religious chapter I was studying. The golden fish swim happily in its bowl in an apartment on the top floor. A little boy and his mother are away from home. The boy was given money to buy milk. On his way home, stops at the Carnival to play a game. Standing next to him a man wearing a black suit looks a little scary. The boy drops the bottle of milk. Breakdown. The man wearing the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He discovers (?) The fish bowl and watches it. Fish swim vigorously and fluctuate from the container. Now, a group of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire bias. Both are innocent. It was the beginning of a wonderful discussion in my class.
