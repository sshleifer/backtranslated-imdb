This movie is not about entertainment or even the movie you want to see to spend time. This film is a true display of true love that can only come from God. One can only touch deeply by looking at this film. We have many dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is God's divine love which is beautifully depicted. The love of God transcends the heart and mind and lasts and is eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character wrestles with his wife's illness, he realizes through the love of God that he loves his wife more than he imagined. He knows that he and his wife are one and can not be separated at all. Finally, you have love of baby and mother. Children gather in the family and realize that there is nothing else but love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let him know you love him. Love does not work unless given to another. May Allah inspire this film and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Trustworthy!!
