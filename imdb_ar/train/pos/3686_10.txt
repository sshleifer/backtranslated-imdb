I and Diane saw this wonderful film today in Fremantle and we agreed that among the pastiche films was the head and shoulders above the rest. I say that because we have a brief summary, a five to ten minute film and the fact that this film was about a theme that consists of every piece around it, and of course it was love in its various forms. <br /> <br /> Ostensibly, the film happened in various Parisian circles, giving a special flavor to each clip. After being in Paris only a few times, I was not familiar enough to easily identify the sites, but I am sure that Europeans and especially French people can easily identify the city sites. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn to each story because of its superiority in production, and thus the sites of this city fade into a result. <br /> <br /> The movie moves quickly and leaves the viewer absorbing one scenario while the new movie is one on the screen. The stories themselves are not as graphic as some of the pulp in Hollywood, they are as subtle and thought-provoking and as pleasant with most of life without a media swamp burying much of the beauty of life under the nearest pile of dung just for selling and selling. Selling ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and allow this magical little movie to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess, you will feel refreshed.
