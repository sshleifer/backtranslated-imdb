I watched this film for the first time when I was a child, the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eye in horror in one particular scene. I remembered it again through disappointment with my one-time friends and bought it quickly on the video with so much hesitation that I might add (to my surprise I only found it on the web in the United States when I was made in England!) Again, my reaction and my surprise were the same Almost, of sheer terror and fear, and my heart was not beating so much. I think that the film SCARIEST, which was produced at all, it seems that Hollywood movies fell compared to some thing Pony and Trap (crap), sorry for the game of words. But the amazing is the power of this film and in Yoni when I watch this with about twenty of my colleagues I have not heard too much shouting and laughter too! Even the video scene brings me fear of God from this particular scene, leaving me feeling like I will not walk alone again in the dark !!!!
