Watching this film from start to finish without engaging in laughter at some point almost requires faith. One has to say to himself, "It's old," "Classic," "Be nice," not because the film is too bad, Because at its best, it is very good. This is a single film dated. It is also classic, if it is contaminated. I do not tend to laugh at people anyway, in principle, and I feel very angry when others do it. The irony of The Informer in my opinion is somewhat like laughing at an idiot savior when dripping orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, yet when he is at the top of his game, he is also a true savior. The same is true of The Informer, which is sometimes very shocking indeed, yet it is characterized by great photography, some good acting, a wonderful result, and a simple, good and good story. In the end, which I will not give up, politics, religion and psychology converge in the church in a way that makes the scene seem trivial and upscale, yet sometimes life. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us (presumably supposed to be) modern people, and the scene is not unbelievable (I buy it, but I know the Irish) are embarrassed. But people act that way, they say things like that. Not everyone has a hip, and it may not be advisable for everyone to have a hip. Are people today far superior to those who were seventy or eighty years ago? In what way? I do not think so. We are completely different. Go now Watch the movie.
