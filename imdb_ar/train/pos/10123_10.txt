Shinjuku Triad Association: The Chinese Mafia war is unlikely to be distributed in the West outside film festivals. why? Can your monitors study a film in which policemen rape male and female suspects to make them talk (and the victims enjoy it) or see an old lady tear her eye off her skull? These are just a few shocks in the shop for the viewers of this police and violent story gangs. It makes Orange Clockwork which has been banned for years in the UK looks like a Disney fee. <br /> <br /> Do you see this movie? Yes, it's a great show for Asian cinema lovers. There are horrific moments to illustrate what is happening in the world of these characters. If you wish, make sure to catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the crazy ending in the DOA of course). Great for Japan that they have talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this film out of Takashi Micky retrospectively at a film festival is on a DVD. If I did not stop you, try searching for a Hong Kong version of the web because I'm sure it will be issued in this country.
