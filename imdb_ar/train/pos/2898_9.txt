What will happen when a depressed policeman works with a contraction under observation? There may be a lot of fun ... This film set a standard in the genre of motion / comedy of Argentine cinema. Potential characters, potential story and speed between laughter has some suspense. I recommended it for a fun time to entertain. Peretti and Luque join their efforts to fight a cold and daring enemy at a time when it is hard to trust someone. This film will surprise you, on the other side of the coin "analyze me", but not both, with nothing to envy. And if you want to know B.As there are a few sights from downtown and city center.
