Greetings back from darkness. Mary Heron compiles a list of films that provide an overview of their specific era. Her previous book, "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", was best in commenting on the strangeness of society during that period. Although "My Notorious Home Page" clearly revolves around Ms. Big, it is a climax behind the scenes in the world of exotic images taken in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch from both the perspective of the story or the artistic side of the way it was filmed and put together. Film and B & W's favorite photos take time and color in Miami Beach through Bunny Yeager's photos. <br /> <br /> Strong supporter with David Strathairn (new off Edward R Morrow Dor), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lilly Taylor. The movie star Gretchen Mol is superbly talented and disrespectful. Ms. Mall always brings the advantage and spirit to her roles. She was very charming at seeing little, and Jason Alexander directed the film "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is beautiful and her body is flawless. They seem to really enjoy this role and help us understand how they can become the adjoining girl of the Tennessee Queen Pin-up of the underworld. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, the soundtrack of the era is fascinating. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are only two of the featured artists. Although the film hints at providing a history in the industry, only the Kinda kind of third kind drops and prevents the magic of pure film. But the charm of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page made this movie fun to watch a film that would produce endless offerings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone turn Ms. Mall into a star that should be?
