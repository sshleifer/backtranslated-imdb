Illudere comes from the Latin verb ludere, so you have been warned of the "espionage game" as a tough but complex and intelligent activity (!) Emanating from a complex and may show silly personal history and tampering, whatever. However, I am fascinated by the mechanism of treason and allegiance, which is the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after many years ago, I was able to finish the book, I have had revelation! At first I felt very bored if not because of the surprising way of writing (I actually began to love Le Carr after that novel). The main character is not at all hesitant: he has chosen an option to restore his weakness by following the path of faith in friendship and love, or not? After this novel, you can understand the darker version of the film "Our Man in Havana" written by LeCar entitled "The Panama Tailor"; there is no game left. There is either a tragedy or a hideous comedian, or both. There is no Smiley here to support decent human qualities in the "service", or at least there is no point to be made in this case. The BBC has done a great job with this series of LeCarre novels: the actors are excellent as well as the sites and collections. Of course the text here is brilliantly adapted. Be careful, even if he finds someone laughable, the subsequent taste is over.
