This story is familiar to an older man / woman who is surprisingly younger. The drivers, the hippies, the free love and the prison house merge surprisingly well in this forgotten effort in black and white. The main actress Patricia Wymer, like "Candy", offers the best performance in her career (covering all 3 in-car enclosures). Wymer was early and brought to YOUNG graduates (1971), but he offers a more serious performance at BABYSITTER. Incidental violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but the director manages them well. Wymer and George E. Carey sell the romance of December reasonably well. There are enough similarities between graduates and young graduates to make one wonder if the same director has also led the last film. Patricia Wymer, Where are you? <br /> <br /> On a trip from Seattle, Washington, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on the MALIBU U TV show, before covering the cover (as well as appearing in the eight-page spread) of the August 1968 issue of the magazine "Best For Men", an adult magazine only. A charming witch appeared in the famed 1969 film The WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> Finally, BABYSITTER began its first domestic video show as part of the eight-film BCI series set on DRIVE-IN Classics Folder. 3, which is available from Amazon.com and some retail stores such as Best Buy.
