I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see a very close version of Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> A number of people have not hated the movie, but it must be seen in the context of the original story so it is screened. The film uses the flashback to show the young humility and events that formed her a woman became. Before the network. By Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is slow, and there is not enough tension in today's scenes. But this is acceptable just to get such a sincere version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll enjoy it even with its flaws, if you just want to get something done with car chases - forget it. It is a feeling of being the first privilege, but since I have not seen it anywhere, I think there will be nothing to follow. Unfortunately.
