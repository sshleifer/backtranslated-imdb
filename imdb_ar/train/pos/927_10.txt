The "Father of Pride" was another of those good performances that unfortunately did not have a very long life. This is very sad, especially if you think that at almost all times, the worst performances still appear on the air (Think of "simple life") I admit that there are many similarities with this show and the "Simpsons", but although Similarities, which exhibit their own merits. Animation is enough, incredible, but good. The best are the characters. All the animals are very pet and funny, and even Siegfried and Roy have spent their moments. The music was good, I loved many songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the offer was not too original, I think this had a lot of potential. Such as "Mission Hill", a not very famous show but I was very impressed, this did not have the recognition it deserved. what a shame .
