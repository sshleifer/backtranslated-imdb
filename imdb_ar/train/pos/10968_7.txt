Gray Gardens was charming and crazy and you can not really look away. He was very strange, funny, sad, and sick. There really are no words you can describe. This Gray Gardens move is beyond the bizarre. I discovered that this movie was read by the great bathroom reader at Uncle John, by the Institute of Bathroom Readers, and was worth the lease and stand in the queue watching the movie. This film revolves around the most beautiful people who have never been photographed. One has to watch them for their favorite Eddie clothes, which I'm sure they include curtains. When I get older, I hope to be like Big Edie, where my nose is wasted in normal life and in society.
