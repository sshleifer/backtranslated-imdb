A stunning former code with Stanwyck plays a sleeping whore sleeping on her way to the top. These pre-code clicks make everything go without leaving anything to the imagination. Stanoyak is as wonderful as Lilly's daughter-in-law, a silent father who has sold more patience to his (Jones). After the death of the old man (good!) Barb the heads of the big city for better things. She uses her feminine traits to sleep her way up. John Wayne makes a poor "veil" and proves that actors are getting better with age and acting. I love joking and strong lines among actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie buffs and watching Stanwyck which is great and beautiful like Lilly.
