I had no idea what this film was about or even knew it existed until about a month ago when I found it when I was looking for other films staring at Dominic Monaghan. I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a sleeping person and what goes on in his mind during the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world sleeps around them, it was an interesting film and a film Dom played a good role by Dom ....... I think it Although this movie can not be bought anywhere (I've never seen it anywhere), you should see it if you get a chance because it will really make you think of people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer at night after a night of inability To sleep or get only one hour of sleep every night, so it was an interesting film Good for.
