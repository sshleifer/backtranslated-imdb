Greetings back from darkness. What a thrill ... sexy movie really sexy! The new girl, "IT", Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominate the show time in this wonderful little classic thriller from famous film director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" ). Craven has a hijab as one of the passengers on board. <br /> <br /> What makes this work successful, is the fact of the first 15-20 minutes where we see McAdams interacting with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. It's normal. When you meet with Murphy's Silian (Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what seems like an event, the film takes an actual journey. Watching two types of yuppie at a time when the audience knows something is brewing is ridiculous in filmmaking! The boarding sequence on board is enchanting, and an extra 30 minutes on board is very troublesome. Craven keeps us guessing the involvement of others, and if anyone comes to save her. <br /> <br /> As with many thriller movies, the only idle sleep occurs during the peak when the pregnancy turns into a supernatural hero. An intriguing conspiracy machine leads us to believe that Rachel has little pent-up frustration to see it, but we can only grumble a bit. The most extreme scenes include the hotel's angry guests, one of the passengers of the disturbing airlines, and the injury of Cillian and FX at the hotel. The power of the film lies in the evolution of personality and psychological games between threads. Unfortunately, veteran player Brian Cox is not sufficiently exploited, but overall, it's a thriller above average that deserves to be seen by everyone except the end.
