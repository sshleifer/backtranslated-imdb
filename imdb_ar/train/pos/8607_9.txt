She has never understood why the song of the MacDonald-Eddy has always been mercilessly influenced not only by her critics but by almost everyone. For me, "I have married Malaka" is more lively and creative than any of the most famous duo. (Such as "San Francisco", "The Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers and Hart melodies (though little changed by McDonald's) - the regular Eddie Bob Wright and Chit Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winning "Wizard of Oz"). Best of all, the "love of singing" in their contemporary clothes seems to enjoy with exotic actions. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Valentines" to beginners today and may have a hard time sitting motionless, but this fast-paced anomaly must be enjoyed.
