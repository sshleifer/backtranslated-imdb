Like many people here, I started to find Sabri who is being tried in this film. By the end, I had already given some tears. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's normal to pull out most of the 7/8 old movies and finally set the fire on fire. Older filmgoers have learned to spend their time patiently through the slow parts, and are calm to know that the big gains are on the way. But this is not entirely accurate. As you see, for the former fans, what "slow parts" for us is the main part of the story. They saw and found the narrative and objective attention there. The modern masses, beyond Spielberg, are always waiting to reach their peak every two minutes when they watch old movies. It's the problem of inflation in modern films. Well, this will not happen. It is not necessary to apologize for these films; it is simply you to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you watch them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is similar to the difference between Euripides and Roent's roving production. Think about it for a minute or two. You should not press what is obvious, but Euripides is still worth a hearing. <br /> <br /> The "interesting part", for most modern viewers, begins with an Irish court scene and escalates until the last minutes, which, if you are ever on board or even interested by then, will tear your heart. It is not a universal, high-order abstract appeal of forgiveness; it is an appeal from one demet, and those who feel sorry for the great mummy, for a little mercy. It's personal, and that's an embarrassing shame appeal. After being angry with Gypo, angry at him, believing that this is the dumbest person of all time, you will finally find yourself having triumphed over the sight of a former Gypo girlfriend pleading with another woman to talk to her man to go to him easily. <br /> <br /> The movie may be emotional, but emotions are not as cheap as some have accused here. There is a matter of life or death appearing here, and as long as you take a proposal about one life to a customer seriously, the emotional feeling detracts from the most serious things. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. The error in not being 10 out of 10 is my fault and to some extent, if you read this. We have all asked for more and more quickly and faster so that we can not put ourselves in 1935 - only yesterday, really - as easily as we should be able to.
