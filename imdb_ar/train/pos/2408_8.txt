Anyone who saw Mel Gibson "The Passion of Christ" and was disturbed by the bloody acts of violence wanted to see this film instead. Although this has not been successful in box office or TV ratings, Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motivation to show that in general. I loved the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who photographed his pupils singing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair like anyone else would have Jesus in other films, his looks look very close to what a Jewish man will appear. What surprised me or amazed me was the scene in which Jesus told Jesus about Pilate: "Never forget that you are a Jew!" Although this may not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like a garbage in the eyes of the eminent men of those days. Keith Michel's painting of Beblit was huge, compared to his previous performance in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David." But if you compare his portrayal of Billit with Tali Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he made a good impression on the Roman prosecutor.
