Yes, some people said that this movie was a waste of money, but I am a fan of the death of the dragon / a great movie / holy film lover in the world. <br /> <br /> But if I eat it from my point of view this movie had some of the best movement movements that were good dang good. But this type of film is that everything fell stricter in time, or when evil was crushing something to save them in time. Although there are some funny lines and bands throughout the film that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were very good. I mean for this type of film that the 3D effects were fantastic !!!! The big battle that took place in the trailers amounts to the noise of the film. The battle between good and evil was in the end, I have to say that it could have been a little longer and better, it was still good. <br /> <br /> Now, to the parts that I think could have been better. The starters were very good at showing parts that led to great battles. I mean if you do not really want to go to see this movie in the theaters, this is at least a DVD player ... <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the movie, but the plot fell in its right place for fasting and a stricter fit only for good Luck.
