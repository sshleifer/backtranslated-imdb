I recently caught up with this small jewel of film on the cable. I was surprised by that, although I expected it from the film team. <br /> <br /> Henry Promwell directed this film with a sure hand, and he shows up. One always wonders about the secret life of murderers. One does not have to go so far as to realize that it is likely that his neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends; do not differ from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, Grandpa, is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at the right price. He has no confusion in teaching the ropes to his son, even to his grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex, a man in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly comes close to realizing the result of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In going to Dr. Parks, he tries to find the absence, although he does not find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic development when Alex learns about being supposed to be killed afterwards. <br /> <br /> Alex, photographed by William H. He is not only a wonderful actor, but he makes us think he is that guy. One of the best things in the film is the late John Ritter. He is equally convinced, like Dr. Parks, the man who revealed the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, because Grandpa is perfect. He is a natural representative in everything he does. Neville Campbell was surprised by Sarah's pivotal role. It shows ability and incredible range. Tracy Ullman is Martha, a wife who suffers, and does not do much. Also Barbara Payne, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the film. He shows maturity after years. <br /> <br />
