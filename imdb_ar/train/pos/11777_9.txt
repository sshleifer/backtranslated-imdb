"In the first episode, Jared Diamond made it clear that other peoples of the world did not have animals to domesticate, but the Europeans did. That explains why we were able to make steel and create complex machines." --- It is clear that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reason behind this documentary or original book. Please do not destroy this wonderful piece with your simple thinking. The reasons are more complicated than the one thing you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I have enjoyed very much. This book is taught even in a university book in some universities.
