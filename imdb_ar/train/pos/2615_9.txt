While I was in an airplane, I passed by the big choice of movies, encountered Live! Almost wrong. Oh boy! What a choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered seeing the video mysteriously for more than a year and forgot it completely and I do not expect more than another cheesy movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this was hell to ride. I do not remember the last time I felt so excited. I'm not sure if the height is high, but the thrill grows gradually through the film until it reaches its peak where you can not get away from the screen, literally sitting at the edge of your seat and biting on the rest of your nails. I got. <br /> <br /> You will first have a personal moral assessment of the situation you're talking about. You will drift from thinking, "How can a man be so wicked" to "Why not after all?". Ask yourself do it. Then you know the racers and their motives and never guess. You will then see the contestant pull the operator one by one and be excited even though you know the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good behavior, good direction, a cinematic experience reminds you of these old movies where he knew what would happen in the next scene but still longs for more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Two things you've changed: <br /> <br /> - Choose racers. I was really impressed with the farmer and we should have loved him a bit. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, I felt you did not care about some of the contestants. Although this has been intentional, I think the public should have been able to link to a majority of contestants. - Rules of the game, big bug: <br /> <br /> What happens if the fifth competitors do not die when pulling the trigger. Do you seriously think that the last person standing will pull the trigger and implement himself !!! They should have given all contestants a chance to live, that is, if the fifth is also empty, no one will die. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I did not bother much because of these bad points because I really had a good time. I wish I had some popcorn with me!
