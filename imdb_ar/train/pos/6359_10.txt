If you go to this movie to see a huge Oscars presentation ... well ... but if you want to see a wonderful and funny adaptation of an old classic, you will love it .. Jim Curry was amazing as usual. The story of the story was wonderful, and some of the added parts, such as the history of Greenwich, made it better. Do not miss Ron Howard any win at all .. But although there are some comments at the adult level and add the split, it is supposed to be an offer for children or family. Try not to overlook this ... if you do not really enjoy the movie ... As for the comments of Ron Howard, try directing a large animation and watch how you can do it .. not as easy as it seems ...
