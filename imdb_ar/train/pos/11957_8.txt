Great Woody Allen? Good number and Woody Allen? definitely. I found myself, along with the audience, laughing very hard and sometimes the best lines of Woody Allen that we have heard for some time. Alan has created an appropriate role for him as the "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, somewhat. Some said Johansson was playing Diane Keaton. I beg to differ. She plays the Woody dialogue, which, in his comedy films, always has a very similar feeling ... like, Woody Allen comedy. This is good for us and Woody is appreciated. She certainly has a dialogue with Woody much better than the youthful representation of another comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find the spirit of humor friendly, but for those of us who love it when it is done properly, look forward to the next.
