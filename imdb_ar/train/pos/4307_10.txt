Well, perhaps not before the riots of Rodney King directly, but a few months ago was a good time. My father said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police were cleared and Los Angeles burned on the ground. It goes only to show the state of race relations in America. The plot turned white to Mac (Kevin Klein) and African American Simon (Danny Glover) to become friends after Simon saved Mac's life in the Black Ghetto. At the same time, the filmmaker Davis (Steve Martin in Gad's role) believes that the unjustifiable violence is truly wonderful ... until he is shot. There is also some existentialism in the film: Mac and his family have realized that they do not live as they really want. <br /> <br /> Crash seems to have renewed people's interest to some extent in ethnic relations, but this one came out much earlier. We may never be able to establish stable ethnic relations in this country. But in both cases, "Grand Canyon" is a wonderful film. Kevin Klein emphasizes my favorite. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary Louise Parker and Alvary Woodard.
