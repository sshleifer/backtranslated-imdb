This film is very beautiful and semi-reflective - there is no dialogue in it apart from narrative; the scene and music complement each other perfectly. I did not initially connect the red hair to the girl and the fox until a friend (who also has red hair!) Explained to me that it is an old type of children's movies. He says that children prefer animation these days like Shrek, Toy Story, The definition of youth is more beautiful nature and wonder that this film certainly does. It may not be the best film of its kind, but it is definitely an excellent and comfortable view for all ages - not just children.
