Despite the success of comedy or drama, the Turkish directors failed to cause terror. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of awesome Turkish horror movies. <br /> <br /> But if you see "Gen", you'll understand it's a blow. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Also special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtrack fits with the movie, but the script is not quite perfect and the film theme is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, Gen does not add any difference to horror movies, but he does not disappoint fans of excitement. In this regard is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
