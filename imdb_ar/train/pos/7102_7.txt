It seems that other reviewers here think this is a terrible film. This is simply incorrect and fairly unfair. <br /> <br /> The representation is of good quality and the trend goes with good liquidity. I do not think there is any error in Tarantino-Esquire's way of tangleing the stories together. Maybe it is just a new tool for managers to try. I thought it made the film more interesting. Some script elements may need to tighten, but that's the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana offers great performance like Sylvio. Antonella Rios is stunning and deserves entry only.
