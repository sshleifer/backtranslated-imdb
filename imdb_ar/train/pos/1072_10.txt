I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. It was a story story although it requires some improvements well, especially in the first season. However, the second season has become just a strange show, and has lost the original DA charm. The story line in the first season was more interesting, as it was a light side of life in the dowry jam while a serious plot was concentrated with the manticore chasing the X series. I was looking forward to new seasons, in fact I still am. I hope the FOX team and the DA production team realize that much of the ppl wait still DA returns. Even after two years have gone by, DA can make it big if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron must meet this challenge.
