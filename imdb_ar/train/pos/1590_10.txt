I just started watching the TV series "What I Like About You" and I must say it's a joy to watch. I always want to watch new programs well, keeping in mind that many programs explode before you actually feel them. I've seen Amanda Bainz since "All this" is really a funny girl, and the best in a comedy is that she is very natural and what I mean by it, it is something that a person here can say the best friend, not exercised. <br /> <br /> I just started watching the program and fell in love. I'm just watching the reboot so far but I'm looking forward to next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole storyline. It's good to see some of the old faces I've seen in the past, such as Jenny Garrett of "90210", Leslie Grossman of "The People", and Wesley Jonathan of "City Jays". The New Character is very talented, Nick Zano enjoys the charm of making you love him even when he does something wrong towards Holly (Baines). <br /> <br /> In general, this offer contains the right ingredients to be successful, I am looking forward to watching it grow.
