If you are comfortable with direct confrontations that make sense in a certain illogical situation, you will enjoy this strange 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems normal, but the singer, the clients and the musicians seem oddly defeated. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song and dance across the tops of the table with musical comedy gestures. Customers, initially immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but nicely) with phrases from the song, reading from slips of paper in the palm of their hand. Inside and outside they jump and dance (awkwardly but seriously) in designed movements, such as reserve singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? Women wonder. The answer is revealed when you open the solo player's jacket and see what is surrounded by his chest - just before the explosive peak ... <br /> <br /> Even if you have not picked up the lyrics of the song (perhaps irony) To put a smile and a chuckle ... I like to see her again!
