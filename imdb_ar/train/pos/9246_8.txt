One of the mysteries of a great life, which suffers from daily life, is the reason why girls are often more gentle with shakes and heels than gentle men. <br /> <br /> Even worse, when gentle men want to marry these girls, STILL girls prefer shakes and heels, even after they have shown their shakes and disdainful heels, they are only interested in using the girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a gentle guy, who is still nice after he lied to his tricks, even after he completely lost the girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gabell is a jerk, perfect in this role, but a sad note for his fans. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow has come across a more agile Mae West character, so she looks like La West in some of her ridiculous lines. <br /> <br /> A bit puzzling is that many other characters, meant to be bad guys - I mean, well, they've been locked up, so they must be - obviously they are nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are lots of nice people here, people in the lesson will be the movie or story, arrogant and obedient, but here away from helping someone else. <br /> <br /> So, the story may be somewhat vulgar, at least according to modern standards, but in the end the viewer will be happy to see it. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that many good representatives really do not get credit. Again, we can say "thank you very much" to IMDb.com.
