This movie must be placed on a DVD. It was very funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I did not like about it was the girl who relied on the guy too much. It represents the way time in thinking though. I have been trying to get this movie for a long time and it was not only available for American format in the UK and will not be played on US DVD players. It's a sad movie classic! Believe it or not, but this movie can easily become a favorite cult, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legitimize some of the things that can really save small states or our country. Lindy is irrevocable, a positive figure that makes lemon juice from lemon. It's funny and charming. She grabbed the lights!
