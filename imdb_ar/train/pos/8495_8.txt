Back in the 1980s, long before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was drafted and companies began to dispose of their national identities, the United States and Japan were in the throes of the global manufacturing race. Remember words such as "Union Yes!" "The Japanese took control of this country" and "Americans are lazy?" <br /> <br /> With the end of the Reagan era and the companies have ended up in a global market, Director Ron has made one of several trips to this type of comedy through his famous film Gung Ho, which earned more than $ 36 million of receipts American Box Office. And while it is dated in many ways, the story of Howard the cheekbones in the conflicting cultures of the workplace presents the difficult truth of industrial life today. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), representatives of the Automobile Industry Association of Hadleville, a depressed little town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (like Toyota Realty), which is considering an American operation at the empty city factory. As hundreds of people stopped working and the town was about to collapse, Assan decided to move on and Stevenson was appointed as a link between company officials and workers on the assembly line. <br /> <br /> Within 112 minutes of "Gung" Ho 'is a comic look on these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally: on the one hand, an American labor force that values ​​its traditions but is often mad Pride and professional unions; on the other hand, Japanese workers who devote themselves hard to their work but lack personal satisfaction and self-esteem. In Stephenson, we find a middle-class American personality of average intelligence who has the skills to chat with people through misunderstandings. With the jobs of his workers and most of Haddewell on the line, Stevenson proves that he is a lovable man who does not want more than a fair chance, although his intelligence will plunge him into a lot of trouble. In addition to answering the heads of Asan, we see a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, who grew up with them. This includes Poster (George Wendt), Willie (John Tortoro), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> Japanese actors Jedid Watanabe, also known as "sixteen candles" and "volunteers." Watanabe plays the role of Kazihiro, the factory manager who is still lucky and begins to feel empathetic to American life and has always been shaded by Sab Shimono, the nephew of Assan's CEO, who is desperate to take his place in the order of selection. These characters give you a light touch, but they do a good job of conveying ideas about Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson's control of the text, Michael Keaton must perform well to make this film. Gung Ho "is really a great success for Keaton, who also collaborated with Ron Howard in The Paper Lal has a series of lighter roles that included "Mr. Mom," "Beatle Juice" and "Dream Team" before venturing into "Batman", "One Good Policeman" and "My Life". It is also hard not to admire the performance of Gedde Watanabe as the best stranger, who first wore ribbons of Japanese shame before collaborating with Stevenson to make the car plant a cohesive unit. <br /> <br /> The support team is top notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura as CEO of Assan Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers offers romantic interest like Audrey, Hunt's friend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganes and Babalu Mandel collaborated in the hard writing of Jung Ho. The occasional music, which was awarded the BMI Film Music Award, by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's music is about 80s from wall to wall, including "Do not Get Me Wrong", "Tuff Enuff" and "Man of the Working Class." <br /> <br /> The success of "Gung Ho" actually led to a short-lived television series on ABC. Although more impressive as a social commentary 20 years ago, Ron Howard still has comic value. It is available on the DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a short change. English 5.1 surround sound options, English Dolby Oceanic, and French "dubbing" are provided, but the translation is in English only. There are no extras, not even theatrical trailer. On the plus side, the digital transmission of the Paramount is very good, with little grain after the opening credits and high-quality sound. Although some additions would have been useful - especially that "Gung Ho" was a success at the box office - but little complaint from the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** From 4
