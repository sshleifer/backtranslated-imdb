This must be one of the most popular television series to be released from the United States since the demise of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this the rest of the cast band completes to perfection. David Spade continues to make a funny little laugh by delivering his unique lines. After being swept by the British series, "Coupling" I can see where the creators got the "rules of engagement" on their original idea, but this is not meant to be "brickbat" - the very brilliant dialogue and the way they are transferred set this particular series completely separate. But it takes more than just a qualified actor to succeed in a new series, especially in the very difficult comedy scene. Since I was part of a professional television comedy team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I particularly appreciate the role of the director and the creative and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few injustices I face with the series is the "canned" laugh is very obvious. Surely a live audience can be used to launch the series.
