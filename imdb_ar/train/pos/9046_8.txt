I saw Jake Gyllenhaal for the first time in Jarhead (2005) shortly, and since then, I've been watching all his movies that hit my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has the intensity (which is somewhat like Owen to some degree) that recedes from the screen. I'm sure that if he gets some lively roles, he will address the Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film's reputation is ever tarnished. <br /> <br /> A good story, with very believable people (well, it's based on the author's rocket-proof machete), a great team? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my watch list ?? With the right mix of humor, cues, excitement ... and a wonderful audio track with many rock and roll songs to reach the feet. In 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the top of the night stars to see Sputnik burning in the dark; like Homer also, I tried the rockets In my back yard I used even the same fine chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I had been subjected to most of my attempts at an explosive disaster! What was fun ... <br /> <br /> I did not achieve his great heights (metaphorical and physical). But, this is what you discover when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it seems to be a dead breed these days. Take the time to see it, with the children: you will have a lot of good laugh.
