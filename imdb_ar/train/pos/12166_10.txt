Very strange and convincing film. It's about a very awkward man and a tight wound trying to roam his life as a collector / door-to-door salesman. The director was able to pick up a very scary tone that served the story well. Original and unstable with a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in the test facility that really distinguished me and made me laugh out loud and it is not something I do as much as I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I did not leave my mind and look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Great deals everywhere. The simple line "I really appreciate it". It is now a creative for me.
