It is beyond my understanding that much of the rubbish from Norway has been redrafted for a DVD version, and such gems still do not get a chance to restore their former glory. I give this number 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films that have been produced for Norwegian television. This film is no less than the historical essence of the film tells in many ways about the first foreign film. My words were, Blindpassasjer I! Have you seen Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew mini-series? But it is unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are very similar. Well, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but given that, it is part of the really good work of the era of the Norwegian film industry, which lasted until the 1990s.
