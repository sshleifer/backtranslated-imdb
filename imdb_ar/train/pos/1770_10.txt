In the previews, the 40-year-old virgin boasts an immature species of a single, 40-year-old man who suddenly feels like doing something just because he has not. Many past bad experiences have eased his enthusiasm to such an extent that he completely avoids women. Then what happens is unexpected: it falls in love. What's more, there is a film about it, called "40-year-old virgin." <br /> <br /> The title virgin is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), a 40-year-old employee of an electronics store that combines classic motion figures, which are displayed throughout the pleasant bachelor's pillow for everyone to see. He has a beautiful home theater system and is watching the "Survivor" with his friendly elderly neighbors. It's a wonderful definition of Lonely Gay that needs to go out more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now the real grandmother is with this picture: she is doing the impossible task of actually dealing with her subject in a nice and mature way. It was a film that could easily have been transformed in a different way by a team of more transparent filmmakers. He could have descended into endless sexual jokes and jokes but fortunately this picture does not stop this low. Sure, there are sexual jokes here and there, and even a few prods are addressed to the gay community (which is by no means intended to be considered gay), where two characters exchange insults toward one another while playing a video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception ", not the least - best testosterone-driven fight for men). <br /> <br /> As someone quickly approaches 20, brings together the characters of the movement at McFarlane Toys and does not do it himself, I found this movie amusing and touching in a way that did not have a similar movie. I was able to connect Andy Stitzer more than anyone else in the theater because I was the only teenager in the show; everyone looked like they were forty years old. I know a bit arrogant, but will you ("you" inclined) be able to communicate if you are the only teen present in the afternoon show "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" <br /> <br /> Of course Andy did not practice When he is first discovered, Andy is sorry, at the age of forty, and his three friends and co-workers in the electronics store are presumed to be in a state of disrepute, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romano Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially said he was like me because he was not with a woman at all., And that could not be the father The truth is that Andy loves women, but the previous traumatic experiences (which revealed one hilarious after another in the sequence of snapshots) put him on the sidelines of good. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal But you know that such confrontations will end only in disaster, as one history has shown with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who put Andy in the worst drunk driving experience and I think that no one will Wants to go and has a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the beautiful girl who works in the bookshop, which was finally revealed to be A sex addict. <br /> <br /> Things about Andy when he met Petrish (Katherine Kinner), a friendly woman who worked in a shop across the street, flashed things to sell on eBay to people. Hmmm. With this wonderful group of movement figures, you can imagine that in the end there is a big financial return that awaits him, if he can "do the deed." <br /> <br /> In the end, this is the romp sex we were waiting for. It deals with a very real problem that may go through a lot of Lonely Guys, not that anything wrong is to be a virgin but let's look at the big picture: How many of us want "Guy Lonely Guy" to be a lonely man forever? The important thing that we learned in this picture is that Lonely Jay should be the same. I do not think he needs to do waxing like Andy (which is a side division to be honest, according to this website and other news articles, it was actually real, as was the blood of Karel's shirt afterwards). <br /> <br /> Gad Opato took out "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and co-authored it by Carlyle and Karel, which originated in a comedy play by Karel. Karel is sweet and human, because his character is not one of the Libyans who approach this thing and close his eyes. This is probably one of the most intelligent intelligence games I have ever seen and not insulting (very much) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Karel's friends, who give bad advice to cover up insecurity in their relationship, can be related to a basic level. <br /> <br /> The "40 year old virgin" way is really funny the end, but I'll leave it up to you, the viewer, to watch. Sure, if anyone can see what Andy is doing and still has the power to attract an exciting woman like Catherine Kenner, that's right: it's not time yet! <br /> <br /> 10/10
