This masterpiece of Lesbian Horror comes from the master of exploitation Joseph W.Sarno. She is characterized by a lot of soft sex, already hot lesbian sequences and a lot of naked women. The acting is very good and the film is air-conditioned and well-made. Mary Forsa is one of the most important chicks I've ever seen in a horror film - it's a pleasure to see her wonderful body. Sarno does not really know how to pick up gorgeous ladies. Must see for sexploitation lovers!
