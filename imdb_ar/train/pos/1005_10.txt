Verhoeven was an absolute and complete trash. It's a disgusting breakthrough for the director and he should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read two chapters of the book, felt bored, and decided to make the whole thing from scratch. <br /> <br /> Henlin never supported that garbage if he was alive to see it. He basically steals the name, makes fun of politics in the book (a good part of it), and gives some stories and answers so that ordinary boredom does not feel bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is "perfect, but at least mostly accurate, as best I can say.
