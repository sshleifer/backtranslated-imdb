This very strange film does not resemble anything made in the West at the time. Thanks to her loud feelings and a network of amazing visions, dreams and images, her influence is beautiful and unsettling. The actors are designed like dance over acting. It contains the only dream sequence I know that really resembles the real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
