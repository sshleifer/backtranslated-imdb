49. Children's Paper (Thriller / Horror, 1988) A patient in bed with Anna's fever (Charlotte Burke), 11 years old, has only her drawings to keep her company. Her condition gradually deteriorated with a series of mysterious "black rejections" that she held. In each of these episodes, you dream of a house in an abandoned field, inhabited only by an ill-fit boy named Mark (Eliot Spears). When an unknown dark danger threatens the ideal "paper house", Mark's life is jeopardized. And her life is in danger because these dreams reflect her health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The first appearance of British director Bernard Rose. Taken from the legend of "Maryan Dreams" by Catherine Stor, she leaves many "original" fairy tales behind. Whenever the story deals with dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give them a mixture of myth and reality to make them work in the form of a film. Director Rose has succeeded in embodying the face of the imaginary world of children along with the darkness he seeks to rape. <br /> <br /> Fever recorded by Philip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with "Jump out of your seat" brilliantly. Moments. Most of the excitement films are very dirty in this very important aspect of scaring the audience to not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way the thrill picks up and never leaves it or stumbles slowly in the next sequence of events. Also, his ability to put things inside the frame (as in his book P.O.V.shots) gives the cinema an extra dimension that may not exist. Only in Europe will you find places that look ominous like the places shown here: the only home, the fields, the coastal towns, the watchtower etc. <br /> <br /> Rose follows this movie with "Candyman" (1992), the real horror jewel of "The Thinker" and the favorite horror phrase.
