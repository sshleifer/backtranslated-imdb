First of all, I liked the central idea of ​​locating "hackers", others in fragile self, at various levels - mainly unconsciously but sometimes more metaphorically. In fact, there are infiltrators throughout the film: in the Swiss-French border where the novelist lives an isolated life; in the daydreams of the recurring and the nightmare; inside his patient body after the transplantation of the heart .... In the latter half of the film, The old hope of atonement for the past. <br /> <br /> The public tone is bitter, not pathetic, full of regret and guilt, and the sense of failure is somehow dominant. This is a very bleak picture of aging, seemingly dependent on itself, but hopelessly hopelessly alone at home. The director creates images to convey feelings of concern and desire rather than explicit meanings. Some of them are mesmerizing, not without humor, a kind of absurdity that can be imagined by someone who can only forget who is tampering.
