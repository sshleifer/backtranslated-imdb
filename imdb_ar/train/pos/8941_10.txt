I really enjoyed watching this film about Delaney's sisters. I knew them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their courage and courage. What the husband. What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. This is not only a film for African Americans, but for all Americans. It is a kind of history lesson and a documentary film built into one with an entertaining film biography. The representation was superior to all who were covered, and we really get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters have experienced for many years. Both sisters are completely different from each other. They came from a very loving and very strict family of high standards, and perhaps impossible. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to let his daughter continue to see her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I highly recommend this film and I'm glad I caught on TV the other day.
