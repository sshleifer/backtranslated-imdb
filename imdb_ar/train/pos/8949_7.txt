Vertigo participates in Stewart's (in his last role as a romantic lead), while Novak takes the film "Christmas Movie" at Stuart to a higher level of entertainment. Chemistry between the two stars is a fairly moving experience, and more revelation can be obtained from the film if magic is considered a metaphor for the special pain that hinders the relationships of many people. All in all, a nice diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
