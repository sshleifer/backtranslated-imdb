Zero Day leads you to think, and even rethink why two boys / young men did what they did - mutual suicide by slaughtering their classmates. It embodies what must be far from being a strange situation for two people who have decided to withdraw from common courtesy in order to define their world / mutual through double destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not an ideal film but given the money / time the director and actors enjoyed - it's a great product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the suicide youths / killers, it is better than the "elephant" - in that it is a film under our skin "rational" is a much better film than almost anything we are likely to see. <br /> <br /> Defective but honest with terrible honesty.
