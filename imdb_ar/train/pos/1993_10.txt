This is the musical adaptation of Dicken's Oliver Twist. For the most part, the original story was preserved, despite the flow of the film, some sub-charts were deleted (such as the summer spent in healing and half brother). The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, the hanged Wagner - a completely different ending from this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is one kind of musician - one that has not matched his style and scope before or since. The songs are often not only unique and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. While in most musicals, a few people dance or maybe a small group dance, there are often hundreds or even more numbers. It's really a sight to see and I was lucky enough to see it in the theater when it first appeared and was one of my first childhood memories. Having just seen it again a few moments ago, I would say that the film improved only over time. Great collections, wonderful acting and singing - this is a special treat that is hard to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the film again tonight, I was surprised at how feminine the singer was singing Mark Leicester for the film. Well, according to the IMDb Institute, his singing was called a girl and this would certainly explain his voice.
