One of the most extreme Mario I've ever played. The levels are creative, there are fluid controls, and good graphics for their time. There are also many bosses and crazy enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels become frustrating, and if you leave some difficult levels and still need more achievement to fight a president, it may be troublesome. Another complaint is the camera angle. Although it works fairly well most of the time, pain can be in some cases. If you have a great time Mario fan. These are yours. Even if you are not a fan, I still recommend it. It's a great game, getting what you need can take some time, but it's very satisfactory. Good to play in short bursts of time. It is almost certain to complicate your interest; it certainly does not have mine!
