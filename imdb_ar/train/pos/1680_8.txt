Elegantly designed and stylish yet still logical in the end, this excitement will work better for non-giallo fans to take care of this type of subsequent Argento entries that go beyond all directions. <br /> <br /> For the fans of these thrilling Italians, they will appreciate George Hilton and the turns his personality and suffering take. The work camera is dynamic with dashes of graphic and odd violence, but the right options and a good degree of music are not overpriced. The less you know the story, the better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not prevent this from being great Sergio Martino directed to Giallo is that the story does not contain that extra nationality or psychological, or both elements to put it on top. It is a routine puzzle, the characters are well known but alive or dying according to the scheme, not according to their virtues and drawbacks. <br /> <br /> The latest version of DVD (2005) is beautiful and is definitely the way to watch the movie, unless these performances ever offer an art house that seems unlikely.
