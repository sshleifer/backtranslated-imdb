They filmed this film on Long Island, where it originated. My brother and girlfriend were add-ons in this film. There seems to be a party scene where they all drink beer (they told me it was colored water and tasted disgusting and it was very hard to keep swallowing again and again, especially in the scenes of repression). However, none of us heard of a film released anywhere in any way. It has never been shown in theaters (obviously) and has never been released to the video to my knowledge, and I'm sure it was not released on DVD. However, it seems that some people have seen it, despite their small number. So there must be something. I very much like buying this for my brother, but there is no way to find it anywhere. No one knows anything about when / where / how to buy this movie? What coordination will it be?
