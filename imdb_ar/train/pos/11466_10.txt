I was lucky enough to see the "zero day" last night. It's a stunning film. One very worrying about it. <br /> <br /> In a way, the zero day is like the Blair Witch Project. It has been fully filmed with portable camcorders. It is about 2 children. Only your ordinary children. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against there high school called "Army 2". <br /> <br /> The entire story is in the form of a video diary of two children. It shows that there are relationships with parents, among others, that these are just ordinary children, just like people we know or who we encounter. We discovered that the latest Army of 2 mission will be Zero Day. They plan to shoot at high school there. <br /> <br /> See how they can access weapons there, how they plan, and everything. They stress that the media did not affect them at all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, all of this is listed in the Video Diary form, and they store the tapes in a safe deposit box to be seen after day zero. <br /> <br /> Actual photography is shown through Survience cameras throughout the school. . Really chilling. The film is very scary. Some things they say, how they plan, you just have to see them yourself. One of the quotations I remember is Calvin's only time. "Andre thinks he would have left in a smuggler's car, doing it in many schools across the country, I do not know what to think, but the only way I'll get out of school is in a black plastic bag." <br /> <br /> I do not even give you guys the right idea for this movie. You really need to see it yourself. It revolves around festivals now. <br /> <br /> A +.
