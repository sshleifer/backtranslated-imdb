<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood no longer produces. William H Macy is as wonderful as a successful man with a soul, and odd Campbell is wonderfully wonderful like a woman who puts his life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, check out this movie. She earns praise
