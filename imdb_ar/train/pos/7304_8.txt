Every now and then the film makes itself scary or scary, though it usually is not. Most modern horror films correspond to this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that do not simply cause adrenaline tension in the veins more difficult than usual. It actually frightens you to a level you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a movie. It takes a lot of risk to make most movie producers swing. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is stunning in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Stroudy (Jamie Lee Curtis) is raising children for some children on Halloween, while the mad man is in a panic after escaping from a mental institution after brutally killing his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the crazy man, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing local teenagers, and finally comes after Laurie. <br /> <br /> It sounds familiar, does not it? Just another unscrupulous morgue full of dumb teenagers and gots of gore. Not an opportunity. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of "Halloween:" "Because of his title, Halloween was repeatedly combined with all the other films that broadcast theaters throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, While Halloween is truly the father of the modern bright species, it is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He has a point, for a number of reasons. First of all, it is absolutely terrifying, while most of the entries in this adolescent teenager type are stupid festivals (one might argue that many of them are talkative, but most of them fail too). Second, there is almost no violence (very little bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not frightening, and does not depend on it very much (in fact, the body count is very low). In fact, one can argue that this is not really a horror film, at least not according to today's criteria of getting the greatest number of deaths that can be crammed into one film, and all the splendor and more sadistic of the past. It depends on the ideas of fear, as well as skill. Thirdly, while some characters may do stupid things (sometimes hiding their destiny), they do not because they are stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they are stupid, we are afraid that they are making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons behind "Halloween" is this is very scary because it's easy to believe it's true. There is nothing difficult to swallow in this film. There is nothing supernatural, no elements of an ironic creative conspiracy, or "creative" or other murders. Instead, all the selected pieces and camera action (save opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter puts the camera in place and says action. What we feel is the feeling that we are actually witnessing a murder that is directly in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the most difficult movies to make because in order to have something scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas do not work twice. It's a success or a missed game, and that's why if I want to tell you all the good ideas Carpenter has (I'm not), they'll look primitive (especially because they have been repeated less frequently over the years). <br /> <br /> Acting here is not an additional point because it should not be. It's a film about scary ideas, not a film about exciting and conflicting characters. Actors behave like real people, not characters of a story. nothing else. The exception is everyone who plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It may be scary to have someone say nothing or simply kill, but it's hard for you to pull out (and most difficult to prevent people from asking why). But the man pulls him, and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's film through and through. He took it out, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote a chilling score. This man is clever and supports his latest film "The Thing" this statement, although Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has diminished dramatically, as happens when the temptation of large funds is used for less freedom once producers recognize their potential. Good like this film, it is not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not too scary. Many concerns do not work in the first part of the film. It's not bad, there's no good reason to fear "form." Fortunately, Carpenter is used this time mostly to establish a relationship between characters and the public. Although there is no intimate relationship in this relationship, they fit the purpose. We grow to see characters, but not to the point that they frustrate when they die. But as soon as the movie reaches Halloween, it happens when Carpenter moves objects to a high level and never stops until they reach the end. <br /> <br /> Although the movie "Halloween" may be flawed, it did little. It's a very scary movie, and you have to watch it for anyone who likes scary movies. Be warned that this movie will scare the living hell out of you!
