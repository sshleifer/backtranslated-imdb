Romantic comedy can really go either way, you know? You'll see one very happy and you will think you want something more realistic. After that, you'll see a real person, but it may be too heavy to keep you interested. Or maybe you'll see one doing everything correctly, but fail to make you smile. Romance comedy is difficult movies. You go to them with a lot of expectations, and usually, if you want to, it's simply a matter of whether the film industry expects your expectations or expectations of the man or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you, and you're a young man like me, you probably will not care much whether the movie is good or you have other things in mind. For you, say, "Go and get it, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "see Guy Thing". It is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're going in this movie with expectations, so do not pretend that "the man is about to get married and meet the woman of his dreams and she's not his wife!" The plot will make everyone happy. Sure, you may like it, but it may not be true, or you think it's tough. _ Guy Thing _ Covers it. What Guy_ Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best support team I've seen in a long time, so if you're not on the main line, you still have something to smile at. <br /> <br /> Whether we're talking about veterans of the big and small screen, such as Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner Live and Conan We're talking about a handful of O'Brien, Dirty Work, Austin Powers, or The State and Viva Variety, or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman). Very talented and talented actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the inspiring characterization of the film, steal the show, time after time, and still frame a piece with energy rarely seen in romantic comedy these days. <br /> <br /> This does not detract from the actual romantic reality line and the stars it carries, because it is very sweet and terrible well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) touches a young professional whose life is out of control, and Blair shows a poor glint in portraying the ambitious and sophisticated female professional woman that every man wants to marry except for the person who is in Reality. <br /> <br /> Much of the success of the film, Julia Stills, is the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and wears it well. Not since then, my God, do not know when, did you see an actress in a romantic comedy made falling in love with her so easily. Of course, everything in close-ups, sound and smiles is hidden, but it is magical, which is one of the major reasons why we go to movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Steeles would lose a little bit of a twist if it were not for the fact that the rest of the team had died unbelievably in their classic simplicity. This film paints a world of broken types of stocks that can not be reconciled, and makes them fall on each other to make you laugh, and then come with a large number of hearts. <br /> <br /> A Guy Thing is a movie I've definitely seen before, and filmmakers know it clearly when they start making it. We have not seen any new romantic comedy since Shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that depends entirely on the implementation of the story of the classic boy meets the girl. "Guy Thing" embraces this with the extra-dynamic feature, where the scenes are moved in a futile way to give the audience an opportunity to learn about the strong emotions and old conspiracy devices in the game. <br /> <br /> The record even manages to ridicule the traditional structural concepts of sex and sex, which are the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists there may emerge from it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we wish our friends would be as wonderful as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I will not spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing shop clerk are among the coolest guys in the cinema, I just suggest you say "She's Guy Thing" and leave it.
