I think this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has ever made. This movie must have been released in theaters so that the audience can see it on the big screen. It's available on video, so be sure to search and verify it. Chris Girulmo did a great job with the direction and the scenario. The offers from Stephen Rhea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffrey Demon are impeccable. A masterpiece of this kind.
