I love the movie. Some of the motion scenes were interesting, tense and very good. I particularly liked the opening scene of a semi truck. The scene of a very tense movement looked good. <br /> <br /> Some transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as interval photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also funny movie is several parts. I also liked how the villain was filmed too. I will give the film 8 out of 10.
