I was not very impressed with Star Trek until the last 2-3 years. With the emergence of Netflix and the distribution of video technology beyond 2000, I can access the past in all of Star Trek's great episodes. For those who do not watch every episode at all and know it by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., the general consensus will say "I love the next generation" better. That's because Captain Piccard and his crew were new when they first appeared after decades of starvation at Star Trek. But to be calm, I appreciate Voyager's creations more than TNG. Voyager rings are also connected over time other than TNG. The data given by TNG is large but eventually become old but Voyager doctor - now this is creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give it the freedom to express anything you imagine. Piccardo is not only a wonderful actor, but the rationale for his expansionary and psychological growth, as a doctor, and self-realization after science fiction has become at its best! His image of Endgame as an "organic" couple creates a transmitter and receiver for the human and machine interface, even in the pre-Endgame episode, to disobey the captain and make "human" mistakes. Unlike the blessed DS9 with two beautiful women directly from the first episode, Voyager has to survive for three seasons without Jerry Ryan and I think Piccardo is the one who carried it with his character. Of course, the rest of the cast chemistry poured into Voyager without the trouble, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I love Tuvoc humor at times, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm very happy because they got rid of that original captain - oh, if you saw the rare shots - thank God for Kate! She has evolved over the course of 7 years to become a confident, reliable and highly respected female captain. What a great job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, enjoy every episode, explore creative possibilities, ethics, and cosmic extension.
