I did not want to watch this movie after reading the Maltin evaluation and rating 1 1/2 of the stars. I watched him anyway on the advice of my son and found him much better than I expected. I will give it 2 1/2 stars of the 4 star system. You should watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you'll miss a lot. I graduated from high school the year the film was made, so maybe I can do it better. Yes, there are some excuses in the film which is somewhat strange, but that was in the seventies what do you expect. I can see why people may not like the film; however, I can not understand people saying it is boring. The film is only boring. You will hate or love her. If you find it dull, you may be dead in the brain.
