According to the G-Men tradition, The House On 92nd Street, The Street Untitled, the FBI story is now one of those carefully watched films that showed the FBI in the best possible light. While director J. Edgar Hoover, 48, is alive, but he will not appear in any other kind of light. <br /> <br /> The Don Whitehead book on which this film is based is a direct history of the office. From its inception in 1907 until the time the film The FBI Story appeared. It is sometimes important to remember that there was the FBI before being headed by J. Edgar Hoover. Some time is covered in the film as well. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary film to give the FBI flesh and blood was created fictional character of John Chip Hardesty. The seriousness played by James Stewart is a professional FBI man graduated from law school and instead of working, took up office in the early twenties. <br /> <br /> In real life, the office is headed by William J. Burns Burns Agency for Special Investigators. Was in fact a major political process as described in the film. Burns was on the sidelines of Harding's scandals. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and strict standards of efficiency, he did just that. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, Stewart and wife Vera Miles, we see the history of the FBI unfolding. In addition, we see much of their own family history, which has been fully integrated into the FBI story itself. Stuart and Miles are certainly an American couple. We follow the FBI through some cases involving Stuart and arrested members of the Ku Klux Klan, a plot to kill oil-rich Indians, shoot down famous criminals in the 1930s, and their involvement in the capture of Nazi sympathizers in World War II and the Cold War Communists . <br /> <br /> There is a kind of introductory part where Stuart tells a chapter in the FBI Academy before entering the office's history where he interferes with his office. That included a bomb placed on an airline by a son who bought a lot of life insurance on his mother before the trip. Nick Adams will give you a joke as the culprit and the story is sad today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the story of the FBI is written and produced today, it will reflect something different, not all Americans. The FBI still has a story to tell, which is not negative in any way. <br /> <br /> The FBI story is not one of the best Jimmy Stewart movies, but it's the first story I've ever seen with my favorite friends represented in it so he has a special fascination for me. If the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is made up of Jimmy Stewart, I'll feel a lot better about it. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow client who was killed in a shootout with Pepe Viss Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not marry Stuart alone, but actually married the FBI to explain the film. Mostly dated, but still has a good story and exciting story.
