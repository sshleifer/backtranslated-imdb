Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman movie direct to a video / DVD movie to be released. (Little Spoilers Forward) The film revolves around a new criminal, Batwoman, who seems personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a large shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is interesting enough, it's not as good as the "Fantasic Mask" or "Sub-Zero" or "Return of the Joker." The main reason is that it does not give emotional attraction to other movies. At the end of this film, we do not really feel sorry for anyone like we did in others, especially "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy made other animated films especially for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but the changing ego in Batwoman seems incredibly "intense" and boring to the extent that the viewer does not really care about what happened to her and which makes her put the mask or what happens to her in the end and here lies the main reason. We did not get this emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found the movie interesting. She passes through her moments, like, when the audience discovers who Batwoman really is and sees an old sinister return seen last time in the original "Batman: The Animated Series". The work is also very enjoyable with some very suspicious moments. <br /> <br /> If the background of Batwoman is more interesting, this film was better than "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it is now, it's the fourth (out of 4). <br /> <br /> As for animation, they are similar to the New Batman Adventures from the mid to late 1990s. The result is memorable like Batman's three previous animated films, but they are still good though. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying a DVD because, despite its flaws, it is fun. But just remember, it is not as good as other animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
