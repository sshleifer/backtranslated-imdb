This film is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The strange story, the dark decorations, the insects scattered everywhere, the idea of ​​jumping and the surreal dreams ... really wonderful! People who like cult movies or very dark movies will find this wonderful. It seems a little to David Lynch movies: Alien story, alien dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire does not contain almost any plot. It is rather a series of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. This is a drawback. If the film has a really wonderful plot full of tension with a careless neglect, I'll give it 10 out of 10. But that's missing, that's why I gave the film 8. Noe Noir is a movie worth watching. Search this DVD and you will be rewarded!
