I recently saw this film in my International Business Class. I did not expect anything else, then another boring documentary (so I do not say I do not like the documentary, I'm very lucky with films in that category). <br /> <br /> This film is a full account of cultural differences in the workplace and how they need cooperation to get anywhere. The cultural clash shows how different the world is and how different we perceive ourselves until someone comes and invites us to wake up. I highly recommend this movie to anyone at work or just want to laugh, yes it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all! Cheers
