Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switched between the friendly roles they played in "All Brave Brothers". Taylor seems a little uncomfortable in his bad role, but Granger plays his part completely. But the real hero in the story is Bison and the North West. The film was made perfectly, with the atmosphere of the times given wonderfully. The trend is taut, and although the film is not entertaining it is lukewarm, in the way I think of a major film, it has been unfairly ignored by the treasures.
