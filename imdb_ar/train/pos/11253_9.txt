This is a very long film, which means that you may feel bored before it becomes fun, but its length allows the characters to find a permanent facility in your sympathy. <br /> <br /> If you are moved because of the guilt of hatred you will find it particularly painful, because it is a story that finds its heroes between evil and weak. If you can love a monster, you'll scream at Magnus Pem, the spy who cheats everyone - especially his country, friends and family - a man who has been manipulated and made since childhood by these same people. <br /> <There is no beloved character in the whole story, nor a loyal "moral" character who sympathizes with her. But watching the whole thing without the help of the fabric would be great. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it in the end. It is worth it for people who like provocative films about basic human personality.
