Everything is perfect in Suburbia when the small family moves, where the father got a new job at a computer company there. But no paradise will be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local rural club without the husband, because it certainly carries secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but pressure presses him to join, because everyone is in the neighborhood and at work members. The good part of Robert Oric is a slightly lukewarm man, but Joanna Cassidy is a good converted housewife turned into a nasty whiz cooled messy and well equipped with Suzanne Luchi the bitch as the club's president. Look for the favorite worship Michael Periman in a small part as a service. The film captures the sense of greatness and grandeur and the final special effects deserve to wait. I have seen this movie several times.
