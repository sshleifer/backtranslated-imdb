This film seems to draw a borderline - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, there's a lot of awesome comedy in this movie many viewers do not "get". Of course my jet mask resembles a Bruce Lee Cats - supposed to be a joke. The man who has a time bomb stitched to his heart - obscene? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers are likely to ask whether this movie is supposed to be funny, so why all this excessive and bitter violence? Well, tolerance for this level of violence is actually different from culture to culture. While Hong Kong fans realize that this violence is severe, it is certainly slightly more than average for Hong Kong action film. <br /> <br /> Also, Black Mask is really a kind of film that meets gender and pays it to the limit, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of watching people being shot without any visible open wounds, many people were horrified to see Bunny and Clyde out of the Wild Punch as they shed blood everywhere. But the truth is that when you are shot with a quick metal shell, it is almost certain that the blood will flow, especially from the artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book. It's true that Spider-Man movies never get that clever - but if they're true to reality, they'll be! Well, despite the origins of the comic book, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is the very flashy photography and editing. If the makers of this film have nostalgia for the Hollywood style (for example, The Rocketeer, or the recent Sky captain), I suspect anyone has found it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it is, I still enjoy watching this movie.
