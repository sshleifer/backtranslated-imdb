I personally feel that this film is a rare treasure. This is not just the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare glimpse into how our society is changing. You have to understand, some of the things we see today will be sexual, at that time you will be considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the film saw many parents who took their children to watch this film, it was just kids chatting with adults. Most people did not think that anyone looking at children was sexually attractive, unlike teenage boys who craved young girls. Them was not sexual. Keep in mind that this was before we had the Internet, TV, etc ... Most sex crimes were not publicly raised. Sometimes there will be a whisper about the child with "funny uncle". But this was often all that came from it. Yes, very sad but this is sad today, because I can even see this movie as anything other than what is intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dancing like that and the boys watching her, yes I was disturbed. I must remind myself of the time when this happened! These children did not know what sex was. Parents knew that, both children in the film and those who watched it. Perhaps the thought had not entered their minds. In the eyes of the adult at that time, it was not sexually then if Shirley was playing a house. Even today's children will enter the beauty contest, many of them dressed very mature, for the age of three years. But the child is just pretending. I do not blame a child for wanting to act as an adult. Or old movies that show this. In all honesty, our media have made a lot of things look like before and then look sick and wrong. This can sometimes be for the better. But I really believe that this film is not one of them. It gives a rare look to the innocent mind, which we have lost for a long time.
