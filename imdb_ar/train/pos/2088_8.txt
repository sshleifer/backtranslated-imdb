From the top shelf of brilliant classical books, this brilliant story comes from Pearl Buck. A book like the movie "Good Earth" is called. It's about the story of Wang Long (Paul Moni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the Big House where he takes a slave woman named O-lan (Louisie Rainer) and makes her his wife. From the very beginning, she began to adapt to his kindness by providing small peach seeds and planting them near her new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan is proving its value by sharing her husband's bruises and problems and changing her wealth. Over the past years, they have raised a family and watched the simple domestic weather in both Eid and Famine. In fact, at every point in their lives, each discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. As circumstances change, their growing family is aided and threatened with friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a villain and a sorcerer, but is compassionately tolerated. Wang has the "old father" (Charlie Griffin) to advise and remind of the fragile and volatile nature of life. The two prominent actors who made an impressive appearance in this film are Ki Locke, who plays the role of Wang Elder Son and Philip Ann, who plays the role of a national soldier. The film is in black and white, beautifully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
