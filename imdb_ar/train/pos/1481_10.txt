Now, these days, some people were not watching a movie without a film design. Many of the dogma that has been changed in Dogma, Lars Von and Watchosky Brothers may not change much more than we would expect in a movie. American movie, the film takes all the resources of the film and its language to tell us a simple history of love and marriage, but much more .. full of scenes and lectures and let you think ... I'm sure, you can not fall buried in any second of 116 minutes long. I figured it did not have a single scene longer than 3 or 2 1/2 minutes.
