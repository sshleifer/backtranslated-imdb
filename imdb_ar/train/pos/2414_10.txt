Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night dramas that have been shown for a long time. Ask the writer to write a long series and show it over life, SOON. Everyone was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true. However, the film needs to last for a long time. I like to see a child, Pinka and Jake grow up and get a key role in the film, along with the new grandparents who plan for her future education. Also, I re-kathy to see her niece and helped boost her life. It was wonderful to see grandparents solve their problems, but family work must be restored to work, and let us see how Jake and Bianca survived during the marriage years.
