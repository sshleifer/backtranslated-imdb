I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and criticized it. I think I call it "miserable" and "Turkey". Well, according to most standards, still a turkey. Does not contain any approximate values ​​of production, the small scheme there is almost meaningless, and the representation is at the level of the third-class play. However, this has grown over the years as a sort of classic campground. In fact, all the films by director Todd Sheats had this effect. They look almost like Ed Wood in this regard: see them over and over and pick the inverted lines and continuity errors (the same zombie and two different locations!) And other disadvantages. <br /> <br /> I would say this: a very nice man's sheets, and although this, one of his first productions, is not great, it has improved. I must add that the only actress / actress in the film is Cassie Roche, although I may be biased, as I joined the school with her.
