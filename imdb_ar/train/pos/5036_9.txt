Bill Paxton, an outsider, near the dark, famous for the Terminator, surprises me with his first appearance as director of Frayalty. It hits all the cylinders, but there is one possibility near the end that includes the FBI agent Powers Booth, who deducts a point from this thrilling movie. Otherwise, this film was good. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays my father. He never gave a name, but that's not a weakness in the film. It actually strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see it as a kind of icon of some kind. He has a vision that says he was sent from God to tell him that the world is coming to an end and that he and his sons Vinton Mix (Matt O'Leary) and Adam Mix (Jeremy Sompeter) must polish the demons and kill them. Demons look like ordinary people killing them, and this makes the viewer wonder whether my father has lost his mind, or is really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points, which increases the confusion and gives the film more suspense. <br /> <br /> The story is told by one of the children who grew up now (Matthew McConaughey) and they talk about the story. With FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Bowers Booth) who doubted it and rightly so. After all, no one comes to your office to tell you he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film has many transformations, and Bill Paxton gives great guidance by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The representation is incredible. The two young men and Paxton work wonderfully together, as if they were ordinary families, although they were all involved in the killings. As I said there is one possibility involving a personal Powers Booth, but it really is not much. This was a very good film that included faith and family.
