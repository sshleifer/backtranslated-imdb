I liked this movie because it was basically at a lower cost. It was possible to make it more interesting if it kept it confined to the studio more (although some elements of the chart were difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The man who plays the DJ has done a good job of showing a man who is terrified and chasing his memories. I also found that his conversation with callers is very funny. <br /> <br /> While you can see parts of the movie miles away, other parts do not expect to be transformed into their state. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very small ghost story for the most part, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5 to 10 minutes was done well where everything is detected. <br /> <br /> While the film was shorter, it seemed to be approaching the right time to tell the story. No more, they have started to draw.
