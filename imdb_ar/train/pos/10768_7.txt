I saw this a long time ago when I was younger and could not remember the address at all, until one day I was browsing John Candy's credits on the IMDb and noticed an entry called "Once Upon a Crime ...". He rang something and clicked it, and after reading the summary of the plot brought back a lot of memories. <br /> <br /> I found that her age is very good even though she is not by any means a "fantastic" comedy. However, it is rather fun, a collection of good ideas about the Hitchcock formula for wrong identity and excitement all over the world. <br /> <br /> The film contains a large group of characters, including an American couple who find a dog for a woman during your holiday in Europe and decided to return it for a reward - only to find her body on arrival. From there, the plot becomes more mad, scandalous and evasive after police believe they are killers. <br /> <br /> A combination of "Mad Mad Madness" and Hitchcock's lightest feature, directed by Eugene Levy and managed to get some of his closest friends - like John Candy - to star in it. The film is often attractive because of its crew, and the end has a funny little twist that is quite predictable but also unexpected.
