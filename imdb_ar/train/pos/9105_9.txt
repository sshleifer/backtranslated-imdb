Women were never as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar Piedras. Although the editor has been cut here and may help the film, it is exciting and thrilling with an intense brand of Pedro Almodovar's latest films. Five different women deal with their male partners and their families. Starting from several different stories scheduled to meet with the continuation of the plot, Salazar depicts his female characters with the same nervous behavior and familiar borderline as Almodovar. A lady of a high society who is obsessed with a body of smaller shoes, and a playful house, a lady grazing her crippled daughter, a drug addict dazed by her ex-boyfriend and a taxi driver taking care of the children of her troubled late husband, all strolling through the streets in Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of the familiar actresses in Almodovar, the director in his first film managed to deepen all the characters involved in the film, creating genuine sympathy with each of them. Women control the conspiracy line, men must be left with each other, and eventually ... surprisingly good for the first film, and worth the time in any standard. It is noted that Salazar hesitated in some guidance for the actors, but an impressive film was shown anyway on the screen, especially Monica Serveira, who played in his previous short film. <br /> <br /> All Almodovar fans, and everyone's fun.
