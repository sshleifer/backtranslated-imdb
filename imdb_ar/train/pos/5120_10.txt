Fast and simple, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> As others have said, I'm also not from the South, I do not really care about country music and I never wear a cowboy hat. (I never drove a car with a dead body in my box too, but I like "Goodfellas"). This is just a fantastic film production. Shot 2.35 and transferred it beautifully to a DVD. (VHS 1.33 was full screen). And yes, a powerful 5.1 mix for your viewing hours. What can you say about this film? <br /> <br /> It's just a fantastic love / hate story in Texas, with great shows. Travolta is wonderful. Next to the "pulp fiction", it's the best thing he did. I've been in the best 5 years since 25 years! <br /> <br /> Check this one out !!! It's 10 !!!!
