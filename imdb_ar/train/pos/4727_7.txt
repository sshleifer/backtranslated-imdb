I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie. Skillful writing (some of the "insider jokes" that I have received, others I did not do - probably because representatives are talking about each other), brilliant behavior (especially John Cassini), wonderful stars, and interesting and unique directions. I hired it to see Jeffrey Mick (very disappointed because he was in that short time, blink and miss him!) But found the movie amusingly noticeable. I will actually see it again before being sent back to Netflix. I think the actors and actors who want to enjoy this film perfectly. The end is somewhat predictable but I hope they do something different (and more positive). Very bad, the film was better received only in the "Festivals" market. I suggest it to anyone who likes Biz acting.
