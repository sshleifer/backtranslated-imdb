When this first came out, my father brought him home - we were surprised - he was completely different from anything we had seen before. I was looking for a certain movie last night and found "Eye of Mind" again. The box breaks down and I'm surprised that the tape still works! Although they are not high-quality graphics "Finding Nemo", they are still very good. They should sell it again - it's a sign of computer animation. Highly recommended!
