From the very beginning I was very excited to watch this movie. Perhaps the poster is the most entertaining that I have seen in the film. I immediately bought one at my home in September. <br /> <br /> Every item met in this movie beautifully. You do not often see a film that contains a lot of gothic, gay and ethnic jokes that critics have praised. Karel and the rest of the actors present each and every evil joke admirably. Karel stays with the whole movie, playing at the end of the film with his root so that he will succeed in his relationship more than you. The cast is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of unforgettable scenes that we have provided. This is what makes the film easy to remember fondly. This film is often thrown when two words "waxing" and "condoms" are mentioned in the conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching him in the theater, I was surprised by how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four women in the mid-sixties come. Despite an older audience, this film still fills the entire theater with laughter. <br /> <br /> I think the kind of people who like this are the office fans and Steve Karel. Many jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you see on Family Guy too. The film is shallow enough for teenage boys and is still smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of bad words or if you are easily insulted. However, when you are in the movie, just remember that this movie enjoys a sense of humor. Jokes are not "bizarre jokes," they are just jokes. And they're funny.
