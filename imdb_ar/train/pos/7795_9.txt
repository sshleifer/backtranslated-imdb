This will be a different kind of review. I have seen this movie twice on TV and I want to get a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in winter is my favorite time. This was the first film I saw by Ashley Judd and it was wonderful and I enjoyed everything I saw. Sandans reaction has left an impression on me as well, as director Victor Nunez has done and has written several films about Florida. This film is talking to me and I have not seen anything to compare it to. The plot speaks to me less than the ocean. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
