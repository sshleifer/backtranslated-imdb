This is what I feel about this show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show restart in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the show but it has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> I hated small characters & joy! <br /> <br /> Stealing story lines from old TV shows. They even stole from the "Partirdge Family". Then one episode was mentioned in the "Partridge Family". <br /> <br /> Actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Queen is the most famous in doing so, especially when she played her role in one episode. <br /> <br /> Michel's character can not take a joke, but then this little girl rebukes her sisters with a joke. <br /> <br /> Lines of story that came and went in one episode. Joey got a TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard of it again after that. Danny suddenly played the guitar. 1 episode is a football training, 1 episode is baseball / baseball training. 1 game and you are out Danny huh? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joy continued to get jobs quickly and without any experience. Only in PBS. <br /> <br /> I liked DJ's and Stephanie's characters. I wish Judy Sweeten had learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had a clean life without drugs.
