This movie is awesome! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film depicts Muslims as people, and there are no stereotypes here. This film drives the story, acting and above all its theme, an emphasis and cultural discovery. They may look like cliches but they are not, at least not in this film. The sight of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca is very spectacular and the audience is given a glimpse of a part of the Muslim world that rarely appears in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, religious, tolerant and loyal to one another. It is a welcome and late departure from the usual negative images of the Arabs. Wonderful movie.
