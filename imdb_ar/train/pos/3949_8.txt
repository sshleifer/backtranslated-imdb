Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when it was first broadcast in 1971. Some scenes remain in my memory and the general feeling of concern is how I remember being influenced by it. I would be fascinated to see it again, if it was available for home video at all. <br /> <br /> Potential spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the preparation of the core plot and characters might have been derived from a 1960 British film, "The City of the Dead," entitled The Horror Hotel for the American version? There are some similarities with a later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One detail stays with me years after watching the movie. It is a small but important moment near the beginning of the film. As I recall, the minister and his wife stopped helping some people by the roadside, around 1870, somewhere outside the West. Ray Milland presents himself and his daughter, Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young woman mute. While the preacher Ray Milland is helping the wagon, the bellflower slips backwards and turns back, not noticed by anyone except Yvette Mimieux. She does not look scared at all, but she stares at the snake with silent concentration, until it disappears. With this strange little moment, we already realize that there is something very unusual about these seemingly ordinary people, although the potential danger to the minister and his wife is still uncertain and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> This one little scene stays with me clearly after all these years, along with many others. The film contains a painful quality on the subject will not leave it, and it is not surprising that people remember it very clearly. Someone should make this available for home video!
