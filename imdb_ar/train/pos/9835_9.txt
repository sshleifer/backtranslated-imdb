Let me tell you that I am not a fan of big zombie competitions, so do not make such statements. Second, let me say that this is an Italian zombie film and that Volsi produced it for only 15 minutes before handing it over to Bruno (Rat, Night of Terror) Matte. This is not the dawn of the dead. <br /> <br /> This is said to be easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is very cool. Just check the two worlds trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to combine these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all varieties. From the disappeared complainants, to the insane sicklings, to the birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is plentiful. The legs are bitten, the arms are amputated, and the stomach is opened. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, flying from zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then there's a head in the fridge. Hey head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments of horror since Ash got his hand in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are the type you like this type of movie. Getting some mates and some beers, you will be at an enjoyable night. <br /> <br /> Did you mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
