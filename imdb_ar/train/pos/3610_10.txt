Girlfight is a story about a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened with the suicide of her mother and a sexually motivated father living in a sexist society. A short temperament and a lot of things to ignite the fire, about to go out of school to fight. Her brother, Taini (Ray Santiago), trains with Hector (Jaime Terrelli) in boxing. Diana was told by her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to hand over those weeks for the training of Taini. As Diana walks in the gym, she realizes that's what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train him, but he refuses because he shakes a girl and must do more daring things. All Diana wants is to be treated like everyone else. Do not look at her because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Genius, genius "effing" pure. I would recommend anyone needing to see a good clean movie without Monkey Acts.
