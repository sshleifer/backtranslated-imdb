It's not an easy-to-watch movie - it lasts more than three and a half hours and consists entirely of conversations. However, they are incredibly convincing and ruthlessly eloquent of human personality, so much so that, in my humble opinion, it is one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something of a lift, see Céline's brilliant Jack Rivette and Julie Go Boateng, which was manufactured almost at the same time). It is idealism in the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society it was trying to change. <br /> <br /> It involves a list that is supposed to be edited by Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lavon) and Veronica (Francois LeBron). However, it appears that Alexander was as sloppy and jealous as any other man. Women are exposed to being willingly submissive and to feminize their femininity. <br /> <br /> The film is a very glacial end of the revolutionary new French wave. This movement was one of the most important movements in the history of cinema and had a profound impact on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Lud was one of the main actors in the new wave, starring in another feature film, Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by François Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Ostach is not as well known as the other directors of the New Wave, but it should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike the similar John Cassavette films made in the United States) and dialogue comes from real life talks. The film is flexible with Eustach's personal experiences. For example, Francois LeBron was a former fan of Justash. Justas himself committed suicide in 1981, as did the real person on whom Mary's character was based. All anger and bitterness culminate in a horrifying monologue by Veronica which was handed over directly to the public, resulting in the collapse of the objective nature of the rest of the film. This charming, personal and faithful cinematic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature.
