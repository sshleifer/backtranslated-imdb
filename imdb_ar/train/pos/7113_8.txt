Being a Philadelphia suburb and very fond of local history, this film offers a wonderful view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are sights in the city center, a train station no longer exists, street station 30 - which still exist, as well as sights from the northeastern part of the city. Good shots of the row of old houses also appeared at the time. The film gets a bit "talkative" at times - causing the viewer to lose interest for a short time ... but the overall story is very solid and moving. Anyone who enjoys this movie should try to watch "Bright Victory", as well as local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. Since then, the army hospital has become a university campus. None of these movies are shown in any format and I can not imagine why. They have a VHS of home registration, as described in TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any other date enthusiasts out there from my area!
