I showed this to Chapter Six about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I love it too. The story of termites and their interaction with their environment is spectacular. The crew of creatures is deep and they all play well. The battle between the two cool jababurtin is really classic shots. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did some amazing work on the camera and was supposed to win a better Oscar. The version I own does not contain a novel by Ourson Wells (Derek Jacoby) and it is not called "Mysterious Castles of Clay", just "clay castles". This makes me think that this must be done with the addition of Welles to force the stars and the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently and it has now become a favorite film for my kids. They brought her to the latest family gathering instead of Disney. If you find this movie, you are really lucky.
