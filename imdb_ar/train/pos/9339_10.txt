For those of you who do not point to it, the clubberin has 4 knobs hitting one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, on the review. <br /> <br /> WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments got this stage. I remember watching Steve Austin, Rick Rudd, Brian Bellman, Jack Cactus, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny P. IPad, DDP in the days of his answer, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, Sting ... I'll be here while everyone listed. Point is WCW had a great menu in the days before Hogan and they produced a television entertainment. Dusty Rhodes has given me a comment in recent years a whole new reason to watch when I started smoking pot when I was a teenager ... I really wish Vince put it in a mic for a show or two, maybe in the next Great American Bash? They're CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! It was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
