Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes committed by people every day in a crazy scenario that can lead to an absolute disaster. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Representatives such as Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension to themselves and their talents and gave us moments of laughter. It seems that all the scenes recognize the bad side of themselves in one of the characters or at least some of themselves wish to get it. Actors of all ages that played larger and smaller parts gained an equally large space in the heart of the Greek public. My personal preference (with the exception of the first two I referred to) was Vasilis Haralambulopos, Athenodorus Brosalis and Stavros Nicolaides, but many of the amazing actors passed through some episodes from time to time. Anyone around the world understands that Greek must find a way to watch this series, despite the passage of more than 5 years on television. In Greece they continue to repeat the series (ANT1) at every opportunity there such as summer or early afternoon regions will never forget Eglimata or any of the cast crew!
