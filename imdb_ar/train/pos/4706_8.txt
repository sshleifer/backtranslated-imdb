It may not be classy but it is full of classic lines. One of the few films that I and my friends have been quoting all along, fifteen years later (perhaps at Cinemax once several times!) Michael Keaton is really the worst actor in this film - he does not seem to know how to operate it - Exactly how to play this parody. Are you looking for a movie to cheer you? This is all but rented with friends - it will make it better.
