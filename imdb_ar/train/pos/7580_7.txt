As much as I enjoyed Hanzo the Razor films, three of them are definitely: "Who Gets Gold?" , The latest adventure of the Japanese director with the impressive package, is a rather enjoyable piece of Pinku Cinema, but offers a little new in terms of ideas while taking a big step backward with regard to anger. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female ghost, and it seems as if it will explore a supernatural land, which may have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, having turned out to be a scam Doo (cooked by a corrupt treasury official who is keen to keep people away from the lake where stolen gold is hiding), director Yoshio Inoue is satisfied with recycling the familiar elements from the first two films, and the result has been somewhat romantic. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanso is leading an investigation that requires him to question women by using his strong penis, cutting off his enemies, and mistreatment of his superiors. On the way, we get the wild orgasm and the ravenous rape (Hanzo imposes himself on the women who end up and control his will), and the battles of the bloody sword. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen and appreciate the first two movies, you may also see this batch to complete the group, but be warned that this is the least satisfying for each of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
