I stumbled on the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked" without warning. Both the roommate became alarmed on television and the haunting images of Edith and Eddie who seemed to live their lives in one room of a dirty big mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on a piece of bread (which was cooked on the bedside table) - urinating the cat on Edith's bed And her incredible words, "I have thrived on him [the smell]." We did not see the beginning and wondered what we were witnessing and how these aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. Must see!
