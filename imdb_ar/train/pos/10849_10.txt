This is probably the best rocky British at all, and the best spout. The characters are believable, the plot is fantastic, and you can genuinely empathize with some events - like Ray's problem with their composition in the band. <br /> <br /> The sound is excellent. Things of real duration, even if they are in the same key, will whisper some songs for several days. What I liked was almost British actors, with some favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The movie never goes away, it goes at the right speed, and it has really funny sections. Generator for some really good phrases! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
