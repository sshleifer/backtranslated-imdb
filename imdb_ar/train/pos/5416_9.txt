I only saw him once. This happened in 1952, when I was 7, film 13. <br /> <br /> We were too young ... but I kept in mind forever, the powerful moments of Gonga's sacrifices. <br /> <br /> I realized that at a time when people can not be offered and used by a foreign state. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, the kind of friendship ignores itself, the relationship that arose between people who share daily life, who see each other, and who know each other, but belong to different worlds, can only make . Then, in the most critical moment, a troubling question arises: "Who are we, at first, supposed to be loyal?" , Any people, family, home country, the person you know near you? You do not have enough time to give a complete answer, urgency exists, a lifetime or death. Gong gives his answer by sacrificing himself. In some way, in a confused way, the problem remains unresolved, the emotions grow with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to many fairy tales or facts that we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life Which I lived, I shared with my child unconditional friendship. The viewer was living by you. That day, Gonga Deen lost forever. Later, she left behind me my beautiful childhood, where I have since left many of the worlds in which I lived. I have left all this for good and these lines are a short visit today I did not expect to do this morning when I wake up.
