This movie reminds me that some old Black & White movies are definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> At first, I had some reservations, but from the beginning of the film until my end. I was very impressed by a mix of drama, thrill and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Asky (Tommy Gander) is very thrilled and has made me stitches all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to your movie night to get some relief from sometimes depressing films "strong" or "overly funny" today.
