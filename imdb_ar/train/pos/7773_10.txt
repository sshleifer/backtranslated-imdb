Wonderful movie! I recently rented a DVD and this amazing part of the work was framed. Douglas was a movie genius and won performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall, who can not be described by words. Paul Verhoeven praised this film brilliantly through Dorothy Malone in playing Sharon's inspiring role in the murder of Sharon Stone in his book Essential Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is full of joy, fixation, concentration, gnawing, garbage, oppression and eyeball! It is certainly the grandmother of all the big and small soap operas on the screen, but none of them have a dazzling style as you will see here: the camera works smoothly and glossy, the use of breathtaking colors, the montage of the opening is set on the memorable title song, Do not forget, the final photo will make you scratch your head as to how the monitors return and then let them make the final pieces! <br /> <br /> Movies that are sometimes considered can be a boring task to sit in, as Written on the Wind contains too much, and passes too fast to actually become a disgrace at the end. Thank you Sir Cirque for his formulation - and Todd Heinz to draw attention to what has now become one of my favorite movies of all time! Watch this movie!
