This exciting West revolves around the famous story of Venice in the early West, which was coveted by everyone. James Stewart is a cowboy who won the precious Winchester in a shoot, just for his loss in a robbery. Stuart's story tells the story of a gun and a certain man through the film. The gun changes his hand time after time, as if the owner were the fate of his loss due to violence. The image contains a lot of action and suspense as Stuart closes his quarry. Stuart's great actors are here, Steven McNally, Dan Doria, Millard Mitchell, John McIntyre and Jay C. Fleben. Shelley Winters looks incorrect here and the purpose of her role is somewhat ambiguous. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, a young teen hearter in recent years, have short but good roles.
