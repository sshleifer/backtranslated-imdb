Well, let's face it. This is a terrifying film. The plot (as it is) is terrible, the disposition is worse. But the film was made for one reason and just one reason, like all the terrifying Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the star's voice, in this case Pavarotti's prime. Well, so Lanza's films may have been an excuse for women, but this is about hearing Luciano. This alone is worth watching the movie. The big opera star, who faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and achieves many successful figures as well. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am prejudiced on a number of levels. I am Italian. I'm a big fan at Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti that's not great, including his fan base?). When I first saw this film, I went out alone and saw the height and depth of the possibilities of life and in love for the first time. Although this film is awful, the sound and the beautiful memories are enough to make me breathe in the depths of life and love it again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is grainy and terrifying. But the voice is immortal and immortal, and the sound is all. So I gave this film a high rating in the hope that someone who had never heard of Pavarotti before and watched and enjoyed a new level of music and love, especially as he has now gone. Like Italian food you have not tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as Luciano's lover or potential Pavarotti chirp.
