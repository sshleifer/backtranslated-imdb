Before Kojo, there was a Lucky Devil Dog. In 1978, "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" was shown on the night of Halloween. The story of a family gets a new puppy (from a farm that happened to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because of the death of their dog Skipper. Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> It was not long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenia, First Plod) started the notice. His children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain, Fantastic Vourage, Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have something to do about it? He is determined to know and do whatever it takes to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it made Ike and Kim play a darker side than what we saw in those charming mountain movies. This is one of the 70 horror movies specifically designed for television that was really scary for a horror film made specifically for television. The music was creeping up to the end that I would not tell her made you think. <br /> <br /> This film is also starring Ken Kirshafal (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Remember Armstrong (who could not get away from Satan's films "Race with Satan"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
