Since my early childhood, one of the aspects that has not really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration undertaken by Karl during the series. He has always managed to get to the deserted one or the other. Armed only with the reliable pen lamp (well, so he had some glow in the primitive monkey ring tunnel) and a camera, and did not carry any other equipment to protect himself or facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> Many here, I recently purchased a DVD set of experimental films and subsequent TV episodes, and come back to visit all the shows slowly. Although I remember seeing it again in the early 1970s when it was first broadcast, it has been over 30 years ... and many of them seem to have revived. Campy, dated and cheese - but charming and very entertaining. They just do not do things like these days. Now all its occasional spin-offs with characters and conspiracies are predictable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter was sitting to watch the episodes with me and I appreciated her (she enjoyed it). Gives me hope and faith that the series will continue to new generations of fans for years to come.
