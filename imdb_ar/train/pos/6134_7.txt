I own a certain DVD so I have to go out and buy it. This was one of those films. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and loved him. I never knew there were scenes and music numbers that were cut, so I was fascinated to see what they might be. I will agree that the "Portabellow Road" sequence has become very long (as in football), but otherwise, I did not find any quarrel with the remaining scenes that were returned to their respectable place. Disney was supposed to have the original version (the restored version) on the side with the restored version on the other side, then people can choose what they want to see. All in all, still an entertainment film still able to restore some memories of my childhood.
