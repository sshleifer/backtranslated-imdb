I love this episode. It is great that they all cooperate with LutherCorp and save the world. I love this episode too because Kyle Galner (Bart Allen / Impls) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Quinn / Green Arrow) have two guests in the tournament! I hope that Clark will join the Association of Justice and we will follow this group of heroes all over the world !! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested in what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a control tower, and that would be great for her as well as the Daily Planet because she does not have super powers. I also want to know what kinds of topics Lex will use in 33.1, and I wonder about other types of powers that other people in the world have !!!
