This movie is wonderful and beautifully recorded. Oscar Prince's music was very worthy (many people do not know he won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch as a late-night couple on a DVD. A big surprise: Prince does a good job, which is good at moving the pain on the camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa Goodon in their supporting roles. A very wonderful historical film.
