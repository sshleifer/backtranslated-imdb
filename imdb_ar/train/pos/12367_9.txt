Well, after a long period of anticipation after watching some clips in the 100 most terrifying movie moments in Bravo I was waiting a long time to watch this movie. The plot was simple, and the beautiful model Alison Parker (Christina Raines) moves into a residential building that represents a gateway to hell. The Ranger is a creepy movie down the right, even if it is a bit slow. It's a combination of omen and Rosemary Baby. The acting is fine, and there are some really annoying bits, like an embarrassing orgy scene with a dead father and a chubby woman in the middle of an orgy cake that you eat and laugh. The end is a strange mix of deformed people and cannibals. It's very strange, but in the end, I really think it's a great movie! One of my favorites is 70's, even if nothing is largely original. It's a very creepy and creepy! Probably one of my all-time favorites. 9/10
