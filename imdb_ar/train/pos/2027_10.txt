What can be said about Tara Fitzgerald's convincing performance? It is quite believable that she is a hard-hit, hard-tempered Graham, yet she is not immune to Mr. Markham's emotional interest. Through every ominous look and every wave of mood, every flicker of discrimination in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stevens is the master of his character. It is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's infected spirit. The game of Gradon 'Huntingdon is an ideal performance for the unbreakable rogue. Despite all that he has done, there is undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite in the end; at least he realizes his failures and how they have brought ruin. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after leaving and taking their child at a time never heard before - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the worth of every life and human spirit, no matter how misleading, no matter how guilty someone may be. Markham's persistence may be seen as a reward for her firm faith and moral character. Although the moral ideas that are largely displayed in the tenant seem outdated according to today's standards, the story is full of integrity, passion and conviction that still affect. Tenant is more faithful than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is the adaptation that does new justice. I highly recommend watching it!
