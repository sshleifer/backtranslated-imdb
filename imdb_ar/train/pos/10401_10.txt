I can hardly describe the words, so I'll be brief. "Baghdad Thief" was my favorite film as a child, and never stopped my surprise or fascination. I loved this film from the very first moment I saw it, when I was young for six children began to read "Arabian Nights". I remember walking to the TV room in the middle of the Sabo Battle with the Giant Spider and cheating you on the spot. <br /> <br /> A lot of beauty, magic and questioning were rarely captured in the film. Sabo and John Justin are fantastic as a dashing hero, Conrad Fayed is very happy like the wicked villain Jaafar, and Rex Ingram is a joy you see as a cynical monk. George Bernal's photography is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three best-known directors is Michael Powell, a film director who was truly bred by critics but is often ignored by the public for his brilliant films, including "The Question of Life and Death" (also known as Stairway to Heaven) . " He is one of the real professors in the camera, with David Lane, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Bagdad" lies in the details. Each frame has its own magical charm. The story is never delayed, and the characters and their actions are always involved. Here is a movie that will not progress in life.
