This is a masterpiece film in a 35mm B / W film. The movie makes you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 am in the bar and how things can happen there within 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly short, it gets in a complicated story with very few elements, and a step into step that makes you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, and makes adrenaline precise, which is unbelievable, not just the critics of cinema. <br /> <br /> But I know how it looks: European short, black and white and low budget. Do not let this scare you. It is worth seeing by anyone, not just experts in this genre. <br /> <br /> Nothing much more to tell him, because the film takes only 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I saw her online and I did not understand why no one spent a few minutes posting a comment on the subject. <br /> <br /> Really worth watching. 10/10.
