The freedom to own your own Sea Going Power Boat, the thrill of going on underwater adventures, the rugged man of adventurer and beautiful assistants (well endowed!) In the beautiful bikinis, were all specific points of sale for SEA HUNT (1958-61). <br /> <br /> Just what was the reason behind the production of a type of marine "rifle rental" series. Let's look closely now. There must be some clues around. <br /> <br /> If we look back a little bit, we see the production of RKO Radio Pictures to produce under water! (1955). Starring Jean Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Laurie Nelson Kerbai, adventurous adventurers in diving in the Caribbean, including Cuba before Fidel. The film was fairly successful and did not necessarily forget his story, but the presidents' appearances in swimwear. Beautiful women in some swimwear that wear two pieces (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a great feature for men. The presence of nationalists and sportsmen who offer their best offers "presents" what is gratifying to women. <br /> <br /> One element represents a true legacy of this old RKO feature. It is on the soundtracks between the music queues and themes. It's "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Luigi and Jacques Laro and performed by Damasu Perez Prado and Orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this song or song (with songs) will never forget it soon. Carribean Beat is very lively, and the rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is strong and immediately provides an impression and memory. Make 45 rpm of this song the top 10 popular songs a week for many Saturday nights on NBC TV on your "HIT HIT PARADE" screen. We can not only remember the number of weeks nor how high they are. (Maybe someone could fill us up on this item, please!) So, we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own token to get the "tube". The audience took to underwater! Well, but will they go for a television series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions has earned a reputation for offering a kind of product, in most cases, it has not been signed by networks to treat multi-station link-up. But they have achieved some great successes in TV Syndication. ** This means offering a series of stations to be shown to a TV station in each market area. (Much like newspaper unions sell "comic strips to many newspapers across the country, even the world. <br /> <br /> So, we got" Mike Nelson "himself, in the actual existence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges has been around for 15 years or so, and has made some memorable performances in the supporting roles of a couple of Boston Blackie films (with Chester Morris) to THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943). 1943), House of the Brave (1949) and Willow Whistle in Eaton Falls (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought in a very convincing way of characterizing him, along with disguised sports fitness. To a man who earns his living by his physical abilities, the diver has taken a good dive, whether he performs duties on a ship or domes under the sea. Lloyd moved quickly to the role, but unlike many misinformation there , Was not familiar with SCUBA *** before landing this concert Mike Nelson But Mr. Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick learner, since many close-up underwater shots revealed that there was no doubt about it, that he was with Lloyd With mask, bubbler (air tank) and fin fins. <br /> <br /> Stories have always included the help of some clients for a fee, as the private investigator does. So what if the client was a pretty lady who looked good in a bathing suit, but even better. <br /> <br /> Like many other television productions from ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS, SEA HUNT has a fine, opening and closing theme, as well as some original music and original rows. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I think SEA HUNT was the highest-profile television series, the success of the ZIV Series by the likes of Sci-Fi and Patrol. As for the location of this underwater epic, it was shown in Chicago late at night (after 10:30 pm) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> I can only remember who was the original sponsor in this particular market. There was even commercials on the scene done by the star! How can we remember and imagine Lloyd as well as Mike Nelson, riding his speedboat. As we were invited to come back next week and watch "..... Another adventure from" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin 'Old Style Lager Beer! All the time Mike was tasting us, raising an old-fashioned bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your mobile boat! We tell you "Coast Guard!) Then, the boat will leave to the pier, accompanied by Sea Hunt features and fluttering credits. <br /> <br /> Note: * More than metaphorically The craftsman, Mike was hired and things were very much like a volatile story. <br /> <br /> Note: ** The joint successes of ZIV include "Sci-Fi Theater", "WEST POINT" (reproduced by "ANAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HATHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** Of course, the SCUBA is a shortcut to the self-contained breathing system.
