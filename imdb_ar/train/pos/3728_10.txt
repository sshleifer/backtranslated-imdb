Never heard of this movie, watched it on DVD.Great, an ideal example of a film that took every member of the team to make it work. There is no typical Hollywood movie with the old actors who have been bypassed. I have gotten rid of any performance in this film. I recalled my military experience in the Vietnam War. I focused on the people who were sent to fight. The characters were portrayed with fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service. They were ordinary people as well, some of whom were not cut off from military life, I remember a few of them in my experience - in simple words - I could not adapt to military life either - but I would never forget them - I should have kept in touch. I highly recommend it then think of those who are currently serving in Afganistan. Basic training is a trip, note that these drill sergeant are not AM people and may need to "HA sensitivity training"! HA! HA!
