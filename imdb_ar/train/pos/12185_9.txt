The lady of Shanghai is proof that the great genius Orson Wells could come out with a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. Compared to other works of art, this film contains only a moderate amount of ingenuity, and contains almost no mystical elements. <br /> <br /> The exception is, of course, the last scene in the Hall of Mirrors, widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of the film. It alone deserves the cost of renting. <br /> <br /> The beautiful surprise was the wonderful representation by the beautiful Rita Hwirth. Her representation during the beginning and middle of the film is very excellent, making other actors appear as caricatures rather than characters. So Mr. Great Wales.
