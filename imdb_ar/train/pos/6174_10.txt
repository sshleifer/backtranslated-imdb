It is really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things Canada produces are snow, mountain and hockey players. This is the second great Canadian film I have seen in the past few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), which is far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is nothing but that; he is an employee of the middle-aged Parsi Bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film explores the sensitivity of the various things that happen to him with regard to his family, friends and actions and their impact on him. At the same time, it is a wonderful picture, I suppose, a precise portrayal of the urban life of India's middle class at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was fairly prepared for that, having read the book of Ruhinton Mistry a few years ago. The film, as expected, can capture all the intricacies of the book, but if you want to read a really good book, watch a really good movie, read and watch "Long Journey".
