"The Murder of a University Girl" is my first knowledge of Edgar Wallace's writing work? And generally the first real acquaintance with the films "Creamy" in general? I can say that I am moderately impressed. These things are really fun, although I never expected them? sucker! The film contains a delightful and wonderfully complex plot, with a healthy dose of humor, brilliant developments and innovative killing. There are some James Bond kind of evil mastermind? Who always sits in the shade and in front of a large screen - recruiting prisoners to kill some girls in a certain college with a new kind of poison. There is also a wicked monk with a whip wearing a costume as a communist KKK member, and gets rid of the remaining characters, such as the very curious teachers, as well as the kooky police commissioner who insists on solving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew sooner that these Krimi films were colorful and crazy, I would have purchased a whole set of them already. In fact, the pretzel plot raises more questions than it does in the end, and the extra load of comedy tricks at the expense of Scotland Yard Inspulle Higgins is sometimes swallowed up a lot, but I do not care because it was a great entertainment. Even the sixties funky soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time. The variant is similar to the Italian Giallo, but with slippery elements.
