Let's go straight to the point: this is the movie I was going to take with me on a desert island (with a DVD player). It's just perfect. If your reason for seeing a movie is that you like actors, and you want to see them for free to share space and feelings, this movie suits you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rolands) appeared drunk and Maurice (Cassavit) improvised because she did not follow the text anymore. If you are sensitive to the movements of the camera, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, and with a certain flow, gives you the impression camera that follows the actors as if driven by the principle of "private space." Cassavetes argues again with Hollywood and the politics of big companies, but this time, through Broadway, he makes one of the most exciting movies about the theater.
