I thought this was a great way to spend some time in a very hot summer holiday, sit in the air-conditioned theater and watch a tepid comedy. The plot is streamlined, but the dialogue is witty and beloved characters (even the serial killer suspect). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not a match 2: risk addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still had full control over the way many of us loved him. <br /> <br /> This was the most I've ever laughed at in one of Woody's comedy years ago (dare I say a decade?). Although I have never been surprised by Scarlett Johansson, she has succeeded in reducing her "sensational" image and jumping straight to the average, but a brave young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but he was smarter than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" is a fantastic comedy to go to see with friends.
