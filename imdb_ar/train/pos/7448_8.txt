I have not laughed much in a long time - although the film has some sad moments too, especially when it turns from funny to frank and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, and sometimes happy, but totally believable. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer - I'm sorry for the participants. Instead, this is a satire, which is very cool. <br /> <br /> It is very unfortunate that all the mysterious words were alerted during the broadcast of this film on public television, which resulted in a lot of fun. I'm going to rent this movie to enjoy it completely. <br /> <br />
