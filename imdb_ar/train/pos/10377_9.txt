A film I did not expect very much, and I only watched a quiet hour pass - but what an hour turned into a time. Roll is an excellent little story if you are not very serious about "making a lost country in the big city, making it good", it's funny all the time, the characters are gracious, and the speed is just right. Toby Malone is the real star of the film filming Granny Matt, a country boy and a champion of local Australian football rules came to the big city to try out one of the big teams. Has the wonderful support of John Patchelor as a small local gangster. Watch out for these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
