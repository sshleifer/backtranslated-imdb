Contains the spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" may be the weakest film by Paul Verhoeven, a great film director like Total Recall, Starship Troopers and Robocop. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven stumbled into a very modest text, taking advantage of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is fairly good, with lots of sarcastic jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film falls in the second part, if it turns into a standard slash film or perhaps a very bad "alien" clone. The end is particularly absurd <SPOILER>, where Kevin Bacon continues to return to life after a number of incidents that should (in the sense of the word) have killed him. </ SPOILER>. The whole thing is very shallow, in fact: the subject of becoming invisible has never been fully investigated. <br /> <br /> In general, Verhoeven managed to stay above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of **** stars
