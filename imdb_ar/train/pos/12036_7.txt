Why am I so convinced that there is another version of this novel somewhere? I have seen the film again this year as I study the novel and I find the changes in the film disturbing - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel has been changed the end. They kill him in the film, but the point is that he has been chasing events in Bethel Marsh for many years, but he gets married again and eventually puts the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is considered a more sympathetic figure in the novel, and the scene in the film where Kipps lit the fire in the office is just ridiculous, and the constant appearance of the soldier's game to denote a child is truly creepy but meaningless haunted Kipps by a woman seeking revenge, not a child. I'm sure I've seen a better film, closer to the novel and more dangerous. Have you just imagined this?
