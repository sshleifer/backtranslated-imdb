Obviously, there was no huge budget for this film which certainly hampered production. But the story and the end were so brutal that they compensated a lot. I mean a wild level Joe Dou and other (great) Chinese movies. I saw this for the first time when I was 14 years old, I ran to the house and begged God to forgive me for everything ...
