When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this film should have been in the theaters. I've seen a lot of films about rape, but this film stands out. This film contains a kind of realism that is rarely found in films today, not to mention television films. It tells a story that I am sure is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today, and found it very reasonable (which is difficult to find in other films focusing on rape). I also thought Tiffany Theissen and Brian Austin Green were fantastic in the parts they played. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have little hard reality on them. I have enjoyed very much.
