Although not known today, Dina Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a gay character and a highly acclaimed opera voice. This 1937 film was her first major film, and he proved to have won the box office of the besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> Three Smart daughters are related to three daughters of a divorced couple rushing to their father, who is never seen after the faithful mother reveals that he may soon remarry - with a strong intention to undermine his girlfriend who works the gold digger and return it to their mother. Although the story is simple, the script is brilliant and the expert plays it with an elegant touch. Durbin has a great voice and an attractive personality, and personal actors such as Charles Wenninger, Alice Brady, Lucille Watson, and Misha Oyer. Very light entertainment for lovers of the 1930s film. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Amazon
