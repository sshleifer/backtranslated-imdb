I remember first seeing this again in the 1970s when it was shown on television late at night. Scared of hell to me. But then, I was a teenager in those days, and I was not worried about movies as I am now. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (also known as DANSE MACABRE) is a wonderful example of the Italian horror genre of the 1960s, along with Mario Bava on Black Sunday (1960), The Curse of the Living Dead (AKA) KILL BABY KILL (1966) and Mario Kayano in the Castle of the Night (1965). If you want a nervous atmosphere with great writing, check it out as well. I also appreciate this with the early Poe films that Roger Korman was doing during the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse CD taken from a French version, a great improvement over the old general - and the print scan that has been touring television over the years. Adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that does not really add much to the entire film, but it's good to see it complete, without any cuts. Unfortunately, DVD does not offer any additions beyond the footage from the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a tug I noticed in the opening scene, where I saw a man of smoke traces next to the camera reflected on the front door glass of the hostel. I think the editors did not catch him at the time, or maybe they did not care, but it was something I did not notice the first time. These are the wonders of DVD. You get to see all the errors, errors and details that were not apparent the first time. But no matter. <br /> <br /> But regardless, still gets 7 on the imdb scale <br /> <br />
