Why do not they resemble meatballs (especially American)? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am charged with "Electric Thrill" after I chose "Meatball Machine" as my first endeavor. This is a review, so I will try to stick to just thinking and emotional thinking. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is part of the creative work though it is clearly inspired by classic TETSUO now! What if not everything is original? I have both of these films, and although Tetsu is the strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is very superior and can be seen without a strong desire to indulge in a dose of drugs that change drugs to illustrate the importance of the film. Meatball Machine is more detailed in its story as it is in its high flow of blood and pain. Thank you Jesus for Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply, the last time I dreamed my dreams with visions of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I can imagine in my dreams a tongue coming out of the phone for weeks in a row. This time (at thirty-three) my dreams were so wonderful. <br /> <br /> In this film, it hosts foreign human beings whose sole purpose is to try to achieve their never-ending satisfaction with the body and human blood. Humans become flesh to eat cyborg !!! there is more!!! Fight the scenes !! Great music!! Fantastic shots from the point of view! A decent representation by a Cyborg woman (at least better than her male counterpart). The battle that was seen in the end is worth seeing ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention it's a love story! Wow, I hate the love stories but this takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends to watch this movie again just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took some time to write this review because I am afraid that most friends and family will not understand the minced meat machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not ready for the minced meat machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife entered while I was watching the climate fighting scene in the end and was speechless. Usually you say something like "Why do you see this junk?" This time she did not have anything to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not junk. This is not only SPLATTER (spatter for spray is also great). This is my friends art. the art. <br /> <br /> Shasho
