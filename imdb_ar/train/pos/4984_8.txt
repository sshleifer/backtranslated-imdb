Perhaps the "mystery of the lens" is forever preferred. The best and the tip of Kajawari is Yoshiaki, a well-known for a graceful anime and anime hentai ecchi. I hope he has more enthusiasm like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite is the narcotic CG series, the parts in which Lord Helomis explodes his failed followers, the party riots caused by Bill (one of the scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Worsle. <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for sophisticated Anime fans!
