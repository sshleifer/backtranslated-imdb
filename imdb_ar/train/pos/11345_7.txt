That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying movie was a musical fit for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island. Mayor of the island, Bovenstof, allegedly a dragon, looks like Newt with conjunctivitis for me, targeting the magical modern flute by a witch (Billy Hallyday, who was considered "a little bit fine" at the time) <br /> <br /> The flute is recovered in an "interesting" witch agreement, with an old gay time wizards. The boy is dressed in the clouds and then "fairy" to restore the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
