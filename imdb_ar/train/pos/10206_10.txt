In my years in which I attended film festivals, I saw many small films like this do not get a theater distribution at all, ending up with 3 boxes at Wal-Mart. I found a DVD for Yank Tanks there, a great document, but what sadness it would end up like the rest of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I hope to see it in cinema as everything. You would have preferred to have New Yorker Films translate the title directly. It's good that the Americans extend a bit. If the title of the film helps the US audience explore random chaos, it would be better. Cinema mimics life and visa versa. <br /> <br /> Also, I found that it was distracted that translation would lead to price fixing in dollars. Come on! It is not difficult to know the euro, and to make the masses of the masses do mathematics. When seeing a movie, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have a spoiled effect by reminding: I'm an American watching a movie and translating the euro into dollars. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more of the writer and director as well.
