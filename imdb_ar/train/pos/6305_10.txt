Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most watched movies ever. Wonderful crew, tight editing and wonderful direction. A big movie does not fill standard tricks. <br /> <br /> You can not say much about this movie without spoiling it. The tag line says it all - 5 men. 1 safe. Without brains. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi and the Rockwell Medal lead a remarkable team. George Clooney must be congratulated for producing these gems. <br /> <br />
