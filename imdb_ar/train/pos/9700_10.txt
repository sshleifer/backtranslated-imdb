In a way, this film manages to be energizing, touching and affectionate at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate life rising and falling through the innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins his life as a small parrot given to a young girl (played by Halle Eisenberg, also known as Pepsi) with a speech impediment. While learning to speak correctly, as well as poly. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like birds, so he is sent to the pawn shop and bought by an old artist, Ivy. She teaches him ethics, etc., while traveling throughout the country to find a poly owner. The film continues with many transitions, until Polly ends up in a laboratory where he is finally hidden in a cellar and finds a Russian guardian, who is influenced by the story of the bird. The plot is in line with the metaphorical notion that language is a gift and a curse. I would say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful mix of flute and digital base and horns enhances the film to the point of pure orgasm. The sweeping camera angles and picturesque scenery embellish the story even more. As a final note, the brides are completely believable. (Unlike Star Wars, where it resembles Yoda Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite films, with the additional observation that my wonderful parrot of four years recently died. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.
