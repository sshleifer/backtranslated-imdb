I really enjoyed this film about the relationships that sometimes arose between American soldiers and Japanese women in Japan after the war - as well as the obstacles caused by their biases. Brando despises the Japanese (which is normal given World War II) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and desire to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a major fan of his acting style) and the film is awesome. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his performance of another GI machine in love in Japan (although the Japanese women playing in front of him did a great job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it but the film is good to see with a wadded box. <br /> <br /> This movie can say something and be fun at the same time. The essence is often underestimated.
