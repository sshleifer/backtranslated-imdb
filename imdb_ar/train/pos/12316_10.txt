Ching Seo Tong and Tsui Harkz are a "Chinese ghost story," apart from being one of the greatest films of Lucia Bian, a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressively designed martial arts film that must belong to the group of all film lovers. Hong Kong star Leslie Cheung, who missed him badly, plays the role of tax collector for overnight travel in a haunted temple. During his stay in the temple, he meets a group of colorful characters, including Yin (Wu Ma), Hsiao Hou, Tree Devil, and the beautiful ghost of Sin Sin Seen, played by Joey and Young. <br /> <br /> To liberate them from evil devil clutches, he must re-awaken her body and travel to the underworld to defeat a more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to say good things about this movie. Perfect speed, with a wonderful mix of romance, movement, imagination, and humor, should finally leave you hectic with a few steps to breathe. The chemistry between the tragic tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too early) allows the viewer to feel each other. In fact, the work on the whole is welcome and full of life, and I would say that this is one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences I have ever experienced. Wu is credited with filming for the mysterious swordsman Yin. His superior character from the Infernal Sword Inferno designed to defeat evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional drama in Hong Kong. The brilliant result, the brightly colored cinematography of the eye and the impressive movements of Ching Siu Tung about this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
