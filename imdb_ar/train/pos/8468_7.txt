An amazingly interesting meditation about the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. There's a lot going on in the time it takes to run for only 74 minutes, but it works. These fears are very subtle, not the terrifying fears that seem to fill the latest Asian horror movies. The way fears are set up is reminiscent of the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is hardly the same. The film does a great job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more exotic and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. I recommend checking it out if you get a chance.
