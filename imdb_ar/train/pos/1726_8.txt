While thinking of the "Great Escape" I allowed my mind to return to this little jewel for a film of my childhood. I had read and prepared the autobiography from 1949 that inspired her, and when it came to the only cinema (we did not use the word then, in fact) in the city that offered "foreign" films, I was the first to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> When someone prepared news stories during the war and propaganda films during the Second World War, I had a great interest in exploring the facts of this conflict as evidenced in the memoirs and stories of the men who were there personally. This later spread to the desire over the years to buy any book on the subject, and finally read the novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarak equally convincing, which provided a deeper sensitivity. However, versions of the films were unlike this version in that they rarely received the goods. <br /> <br /> Black and white films are not as good as they were in those years. I have never seen any technical version of the war that sounds as authentic as chiaroscuros does for films like "The Wooden Horse." If it is true that we are always destined to be captivated by the images of our childhood, I freely admit it. <br /> <br /> There will never be the likes of Liu Jin as a symbolic British war hero in the film. Not even Sir Alec.
