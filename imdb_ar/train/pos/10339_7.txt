I watched a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the group of African-African film trailers. It looked like it was. A very attractive "idiot" comedy in which a very respectful black man realizes that his son is an idiot. The wife of Redd Foxx (RF) appears to have left his brother, who works with him in the "store" in Phoenix. He took the bus to visit his son, Norman, from Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So with the arrival of the RF, Norman, dressed only in dark blue bikini shorts, comes out of the water bottom to answer the door. Trying to buy time by making his aging father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to awaken his sweetheart, who steadfastly refuses to budge. It was just a point where I wrote "Why not wake up?" When he did so suddenly, I and my friend fell for the first time several times as we got a first glimpse of Dark-haired Garson, a white Norman lover, who was "more than others" a faaaaaabulous dream ?? "Garson is a flaming queen of a kind that can only be imagined as emerging since 1976 and has dresses and a huge and trendy purse, and he seems to have designed both his form and personality on Carol Brady of The Brady Bunch. <br /> <br /> Norman orders His lover finds another place to stay while he visits his father, and Garrison goes to stay with Ayalon Flowers, and the lady will answer the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So RF tries to reach his wife in Mexico While on the phone, To pack his clothes and face the radio frequency.In the explosion of the music of the seventies of the last century was intended to evoke the dawn (but it seems like a About to hear a very special from The Emotions) cut off, he realizes that his son gay. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is "Soguetlh. I'll kill him. "Then RF goes on a long walk, wandering around all the ideas that a confused parent might have, such as" maybe we trained him too early. "All his ideas are inspired by something he sees in his career, It is quite surprising that he goes to a bookshop and buys about eight books on homosexuality.This, it should be said, is about eight books on homosexuality than my father bought.Then he goes straight to the park bench And read them all! <br /> <br /> Then Rf Audrey, an Amazon whore, rents six-foot high Dam (in this amazing thing from the fur) is played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones, who has hired Norman to try to beat the opposite sex, but this pisses on Norman and leaves her to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then comes Garson and offers to drop He relaxes because of the loss of RF wife, tells the story of his mother, who carries an irrational bias against Pilippinos because she "was harassed at Loa." They attend a long distinguished show of Wayon and Madam, culminating in Madame who blows her head violently against the piano until She loses her hair. Again, the mouths were angry. <br /> <br /> So it seems that, you will not know it completely, RF and Garson will have a wonderful evening together! You see, the older, older black men should only see the rich and luxurious entertainment of the giant queens in order to reach all that the gay world offers! It's really that simple! This still does not prevent RF from shouting "Rape!" When Garson wakes up from a bad dream. It ends up being less predictable than you think. <br /> <br /> There was a lot more to be expected. What is the relationship between Norman and Garrison? They do not seem to have any connection. Norman has no concern at all about Garrison's expulsion, and even when he comes to defend himself, he never defends Garrison or talks about their relationship. There was a kind of gentle alien touches like RF to buy all those books about homosexuality - and sit straight on the garden bench to read it! I like the idea that a parent will actually try to discover something about homosexuality, rather than just running to be engulfed or angry with his friends. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a kind of thing that looks just like: small vestiges of a past era, an era when some gay people thought that if straight people sat and watched a magical performance, we could all learn to love and understand each other! Because of the sheer naivet√© of this, extreme stereotypes and message-filled dialogue no longer have an antiquated effect and provide a great deal of controversy to discuss how things have changed for homosexuals in the past 30 years. I think the only thing that seems insulting is the idea that lesbian friends who live in desperate love for them and are willing to drown them into sleep so they can sleep and turn them over. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, check out Cinema de Merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in).
