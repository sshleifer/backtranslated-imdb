There were very few mainstream films that were developed in postcolonial Africa, and films that had a mixed mix. This, in his altruistic propaganda to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa, which show that they are not very different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. It also has shortcomings, given the unjustified influence of Western perceptions of Africans, especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful American-American wife of English physician David Linderbie, was captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy. Sulaiman, the leading slave trader, is the Arab theater everywhere, with his rhetoric and humor sometimes, and gestures for the match - which will not be misplaced on "Carry On Follow That Camel" but not standard. Peter Ostinov of course had more than enough skill to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he saved what would otherwise have been a sad one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the stereotype, all three of which are the employees of the Arab Sulaiman are not smart and one has a fond dispositions towards the boy, which fortunately was not filmed on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of Dawood's first liaison officers is the local police officer, a typical and incompetent African man. A bureaucrat. David then meets with two former white novels, the English (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and the American (Sandel, William Holden). Sandel is a mercenary with "traditional" views on mixed race relations, which initially refuses to help unless David offers advance payment. David agreed to love Anansa, aware of his inability to find love, and agreed to seize David in his helicopter to help search for Anansa. They found that Suleiman and his family were crossing the border and could not chase them to neighboring lands - as a result of Sandel's hesitation and David's lack of experience in the field of firearms, his helicopter was dropped but David survived. <br /> <br /> Then we see David present to Malik (Kiddi Bidi), an African who lost his family to Suleiman and is now driven only by revenge. They find the girl Sanufu with a group of Tuaregs and know they are on the right track to find Solomon. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heart-rending scenes, they kill only a group of slave traders to find out that they were not Solomon's group, and they have no choice but to send their prisoners to the Touaregs who met them earlier. <br /> <br /> Later, we discovered that the young boy who was raped was a charming doctor, and in an excellent scene with supernatural tones, he used his knowledge to kill one of Solomon's followers. Anansa for her part - and despite the boy's doubts - was able to engineer the death of two other Sulaiman employees. <br /> <br /> By this time, Solomon and his servants became within days of reaching the slave market. <br /> <br /> Solomon, who now has no doubt that Ananza is a "problem", is trying to sell it to a corrupt and clever Arab prince (Omar Sharif). When it is discovered that an American man is working for the United Nations, the prince wisely decides not to continue bargaining without considering the consequences. The scene where the two men are bargaining is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> In the slave market, the little boy is sold to middle-aged cribs and leaves us to guess whether he still considers the boy a "wunderbar" when his owner is at the receiving end of his magical medical skills. <br /> <br /> Finally, both David and Malik face Solomon and there is a bitter bitter end from Malik's point of view. <br /> <br /> In the end, David and Anansa are reunited, and the owner, who crashed his life, can console himself by seeing the task he has set for himself. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the film is excellent, but it loses its stereotyping of all the leading characters. All leading players should be credited for addressing many of the limitations of scripting.
