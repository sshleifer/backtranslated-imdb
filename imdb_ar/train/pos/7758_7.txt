Melodrama is typically overpriced in its mid-fifties and proper food. Rock Hudson, a person who is always on his own, plays his usual role in stereotyping, but while he was in the same year, when his subjects and stars were above average, Just not good enough to raise the caliber behind a mushy story of how difficult it is to be rich and happy alike. The self-destructing brother and sister (Robert Stack, staggering through the movie in drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, who plays the role of a rich little girl who is rich and up high above the top) is ultimately on the losers and Hudson gets Buckal - who is rather wooden in this part which He does not have enough personality or wit to make it continuous. To rephrase Oscar Wilde, good ending Fortunately and unfortunately, this is a fantasy meaning. However, I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story that proved this plot. Like other films of this period, heterosexuality is hidden. Maybe the film could be again: Stack's character will actually appear if he hides Mitch's homosexuality through marriage. Todd Haynes was far from heaven on All All Heaven Allows, also directed by Sirk. Heinz may have been able to rewrite "Written on the Wind" and give us an unforgettable film.
