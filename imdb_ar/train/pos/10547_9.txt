I watched the trailer on DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who watched it before watching the movie would be very surprised and perhaps disappointed. Much of the fact that the film was "made by the director of Cube" and made it look like a horror film, while it is actually a futile comedy (IMDB does not seem to be the word absurdist word, but it does), reminds us of Rosencrantz and Goldenstern by death. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story slowly accumulated at first, then gradually escalated. I also enjoy the fact that there is no explanation for what is happening in the film. So the fact that the story is mainly shown in only one set is the only aspect that is similar to the movie Cube. I highly recommend it.
