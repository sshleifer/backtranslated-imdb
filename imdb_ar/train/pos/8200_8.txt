Clint Eastwood certainly produced better films than this, but this film does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry attracts everyone's attention and unless you want to see romance, there's no reason why you should not. It's nice because it's dirty, it's wonderful because it kills without much thinking, it's perfect because it hits the bullet in your heart and a hero because it does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I have given the films in which Eastwood acts, the character of the leading role is always captivating the audience. In the heart of White Hunter Black, he is a crazy director, in the "line of fire" is the "old" while he is here "quasi" unemployed with his job, meaning that he makes the work for himself, no one cares for his bosses who send him practically for a vacation. <br /> <br /> Based on the victim of rape, this film is promising to all film watchers 'meaningless'. The film has nothing to keep away from the central plot. However, what makes him inferior to Eastwood's best films is that although the character of the leading role is the embodiment of the plot, they are not very clear, from the beginning. It's not a movie that makes you sit in a place without moving. Also, there are a lot of people much dirtier than Harry Dirty.
