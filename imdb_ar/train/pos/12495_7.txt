What's good about it: some creative and creepy little influences that will be exposed to even the most seasoned horror enthusiasts. Do not rely on vulgar stabs at the moments of "catch you". Even if you've seen everything, there are still some things in this movie that will make your jaw fall. <br /> <br /> What could have been better: acting was, at times, unconvincing. The quality of "shooting on video" was in some places (although it often achieved the atmosphere it was seeking), and the camera's work was full of taking unnecessary pictures of senseless actions. Although the effects were really scary, I think they probably have gone to the well several times with each other. The end seemed hasty, ignoring what could have been more influential moments. Leaves the viewer to discover many things for themselves, not as a challenge by filmmakers, but because they did not miss them. <br /> <br /> However, the small independent horror film which is easily several steps above the average. Well worth the rent.
