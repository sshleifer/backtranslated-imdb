"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first color film about Mr. Akira Kurosawa, and it is amazing that it does not revolve around Samurai, Ronin, warlords or battlefields. He is in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the population is homeless, beggars, traps, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and the environment to put colors, but they are actually very sad stories, some of them tragic. The story of the boy who is believed to be driving a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her mother's husband. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden ?? The Life of Life")
