I can not stop saying how much I liked this movie. This film is one of the least famous and entertaining films. The film follows rap group exploits, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). Extending from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after its tragic disintegration. After the group is documentary filmmaker Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film shows a limited budget, but it does not seem to be important, it's a good production film and a good product, and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent. The main force of this film is writing, there are many wonderful lines and rap in this film, it is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are real rap rappers like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste, Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, etc. .) Rusty Condieff made an excellent film. In the film, rapper Ice Cold plays. The film does not stop, it's funny from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The movie works well because it gets strange at times, but it highlights this line where it is funny without going far there. Trying to listen to the three customers who tried to talk to a kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, such as Tone Def to tell one of the recording producers, when you board the bus, get there, and respond to the product, ?? This is deep! '<br /> <br /> The collection depicting NWH has a kind of natural chemistry for them. They work well together, and they can pull this movie to where there is no moment in the movie. What makes this movie really good is how true some rap groups were at the time this movie appeared. Many rap groups faced problems with violence, with censorship, and like the NWA, the group became famous only when the foundation began to create a large part of the controversial lyrics. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here that hurts everyone in a good way. The film has a takeoff on a large number of people outside rap, the most entertaining of Spike Lee. Where they reached this dialogue I can not imagine. The film contains line by line, which makes you roll on the ground. As I said before writing is very excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this movie is comparable to this limited version. It's a controversial and thought-provoking film. This is very much for the mainstream, although it is hilarious and almost devoid of defects in its production. There are no major stars, but there are a lot of familiar faces, including Mark Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you will definitely have a view in it.
