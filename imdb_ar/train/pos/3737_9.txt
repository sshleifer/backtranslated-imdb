First, this film was a road trip all the way. The story of soldiers training, fighting with their superiors, and finally rallying together. <br /> <br /> From start to finish. This is one war play worth seeing if you're constantly moving (sometimes beyond the cause) and the horrors of the boot camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how actors interacted were sometimes very amazing and sometimes humorous. How Booz (Colin Farrell) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story, from the camp to Tiggerland, and even in the end helps him. <br /> <br /> Creative photography has not given a taste to the film. Constant movement, continuous work, and constant confusion only. Sometimes, they were helpful. Others, not much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it was a growing reality. It seems that some points in the film (sex scenes in particular) are just a very realistic boy although they added an impact on the film that would not exist there without it. It was a very brave film, through and through it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrell's best films (if not his best performance). The representation of each character was fantastic. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
