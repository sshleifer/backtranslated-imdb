I really like this film for some reasons, I'll be back late but I want to touch on why I think people do not like it. First, there are people who want to hate Tom Cruise. I do not really understand it. Second, I think Cameron Crowe succeeded in two groups of movie pioneers in this film. A group of unfamiliar and comfortable filmgoers, "who are not looking to think hard", is left puzzled when they take the entire plot 180 at the end of the film. The deep, philosophical devastation is shattered when Crowe has one of his characters to explain the mystery completely. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job at it. I think it is probably his best performance than I have seen although I have not seen all of his films, or even most of them most likely. Cast good support as well. Penelope Cruz offers a strong performance and Jason Lee was fun. <br /> <br /> I liked the story, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky represents more than anything else. It's a puzzle, adventure, and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. It has many philosophical tones to it, and many similar ideas and stories such as these occur in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, lost it to some extent, was given a second chance to recover everything, and finally faced his demons and the full range of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity and normal life to see if he can find in the end The only thing he could not control: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people are disappointed because Crow has put the whole puzzle in the end. I think it is necessary. Then the public knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David realizes his circumstances and ultimately makes the choice more powerful. <br /> <br /> The music in the movie is great. Maybe it makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. In particular, "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, a wonderful song. <br /> <br /> In general, I will give it 3 out of 4 stars. It's a movie that contains some material for those who like to think about things, and a wonderful story for those looking for relaxation. Perhaps this "moderate" approach is why people hate this very much because it is not a full mystery or a complete love story. Blends and matches different items and types.
