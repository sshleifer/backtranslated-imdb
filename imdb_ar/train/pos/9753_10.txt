... in our home. Like everyone who commented on this film, my brothers (7 and 4 years old at that time) and I (10) will watch this movie again and again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to this game because of the wonderful songs and adventure. We loved all the beauty and sang at the top of his lungs during his song. There were some slow moments (the time spent by King Koo-Koo at home) and we were generally bored after The Knight ("Cause I'm Sounding You"), but we loved the trip to save Babbette and the end were all a little scary From the image of the king Kuo floating there that dominates the entire horizon, and finally laugh at maniac. I still today even sing "shout me! Babette of Paris gay!" About my friends (I'm 33 years old) who look at me as if I lost my mind; yet, when I sing, I am 10 years old again with the year of Star Wars.
