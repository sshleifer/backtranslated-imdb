Some attribute to the "play is the most important thing", or something like that, to the cool of Avon, himself, William Shakespeare. If it is not the old will, it may have been our veteran film director, Mr. Raul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. Nothing is more convenient than the JIM GENTLEMAN (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also made another award, naming it Errol Flynn's favorite for his championship cars. Provides a clear guide on the screen that will easily lead viewers to sit in the dark theater, or watch it on their TV or DVD, to wrap it up. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a semi-dangerous story Biopic, which takes a part of the material realism and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to provide us with very satisfactory events, although somewhat fictional (what is not Biopic?). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, because it benefits well from the natural sporting spirit of our leadership, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although GENTLEMAN JIM is only a Swashbuckler or Western player or a war, GENTLEMAN JIM is the best role for the promising Australians. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in Fine Science are clearly visible throughout the film, especially in the Big Fight of the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship with Great John L. Sullivan, himself. By Ward Bond) The acting team reads as a list of players for Warner Bros. supporters. It features Alan Hill as the father of Jim Corbett, a Livery Wagon * player. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two "blue collar" men in the family, and are referred to as "Longshoremen". <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson performs his usual comic-book performance in supporting as a friend Jim Corbett and a friend of the bank. The rest of those we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, and Dorothy Vaughn, to name a few. <br /> <br /> Walsh has also used a number of professional wrestlers in the roles of various boxers. Hence our Ed "Strangler" Lewis and Grappler * are not known as two waterfront cliffs in the opening scenes. Others were Sami Stein and Mike Mazurki (hear from him?) And "Wei Willie" Davis. These men had a strong, but not polished look, which could have been enjoyed by the old fans of Pierre 9. <br /> <br /> We did not forget the leading lady, Alexis Smith. She is strong in describing an "independent" woman, but she maintains her real enough ability as a comedian in many scenes. She presents a large collection of her part as a poor little rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix items at appropriate rates to give them a "just right" mix. Well, Director Walsh is doing so recklessly. Because he is looking, above all, for a wonderful film. His treatment shows all the skills he has refined to fine tune from his days as a player with d. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a particular fondness for that period, the nineties of the nineteenth century. *** Mr. Walsh's direction moves through the script in a fairly fast clip, where the scenes break the line with a line break, "The Corbetts in it again!" Thus, he is able to maintain a light touch and humor for a story that can become very serious. <br /> <br /> Moreover, in an almost unnoticeable element, the brother gives us an authentic view of San Francisco from 1890. As another example of his fondness for that period, he creates dynamic images of the battles of the historic prize. There is a vibrant and cheerful mood in these boxing scenes. As the crowning glory of this great film, perhaps belittled, Walsh gave the photo as if it were an illustration of the Polis newspaper, which covered such events in the "old days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to remember before watching. If this is the first time, or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "The companies are running again !!" <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion as a historian for both Film and Pro Wrestling, he looks like Tor Johnson, who after years was a favorite of Ed Wood's. <br /> <br /> ** The term "Livery" is a fairly old term for a vehicle to rent local transport in the city. <br /> <br /> *** That's true. Mr. Raul Walsh was a veteran Griffith player. He was the active actor for John Wilkes Booth's portrayal of the birth of a nation (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Raul Welch was born in 1887, old enough to have his own memories of 1890 and the Sullivan Corbett Championship and what it meant for American sports in those days.
