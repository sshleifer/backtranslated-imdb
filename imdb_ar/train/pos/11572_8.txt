"In April 1946, the University of Chicago approved the operation of the Argonne National Laboratory, with a consortium of Middle Eastern universities that sponsored the research, Argon became the first" national "laboratory, but it did not remain in its original location in the Argonne Forest: West of Wind City to a new location on Illinois agricultural land. When Arjun's manager, Alvin Weinberg, visited Walter Zein in 1947, they asked him about the type of reactor to be built in when Zinn described a heavy water reactor that operated in a ten-power material test reactor Under design at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked it would be simpler if Zinn took Oak Ridge's design and ran it The material test reactor in the tenth power. "The humor proved to be an unintended prophecy." <br /> <br /> S-50 used the convection to separate isotopes in thousands of long columns. It was built next to the K-25 power plant, which provided the necessary steam. Less efficient than the K-25, the S-50 was demolished after the war. <br /> <br /> Concerned that the IAEA research program could become highly academic, Lilienthal established a committee of industrial consultants during his visit to Oak Ridge in November. He discussed with Clark Center, the director of Carbide & Carbon, Union Carbide at Oak Ridge, the possibility of taking over the management of the laboratory. <br /> <br /> Prince Henry (Prussia) arrives in Washington and visits the German Embassy (1902). Clearly, with Prince Henry of Prussia according to the principles and risks of science, they were already interested in the applications of new science with military applications. The Hohenzollern (1902 / II), "Kaiser Wilhelm's magnificent yacht at St. Pierre 34, New York was captured at the exact moment of Prince Henry's arrival, raising the royal level." If kings knew these precautions necessary for the welfare of the citizen, what was the necessity of World War I and World War II.

Because it was assumed that these were not survivors, and ordered those arrested in Europe to execute them. Of the 400 commando men, the survivors who were captured on orders of the German army against vandalism and the acts of espionage carried out by the State of Germany were executed. <br /> <br /> The Führer No. 003830/42 g.
