I watched this show on the basis that it was told that it reminds us of David Lynch's "Peak Peaks," a show I adore. The show begins quickly in our introduction of the main characters, and without exception, the experimental episode is the best for me, it is very exciting and fully graduated from the evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I was slightly disappointed with the show - perhaps not by his own fault, which was canceled after just one season - seemed to show great potential and deserved much better treatment. Representation is excellent, and this show contains some of the best characters (good and evil) in which I saw it was developed well in a short period of time. There is a strange cheesy effect on the top five or top 10 shows that are overly dramatic, but this is corrected as the season progresses. Well worth watching, and definitely something out of the ordinary!
