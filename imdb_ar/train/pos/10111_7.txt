A haunted world of Edward Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. In aesthetic terms, it seems paltry and cheap, as people explode in the shadows, making it very uncoordinated and incoherent, but this adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about an eccentric ball that filmed eccentric images and surrounded itself with its strange colleagues. Therefore, there is no other way to document the life and professionalism of the wrong man and his crew. There are some glimpses of insight for both genius and inefficient Wood, and portraying both qualities is credited with the originality of the documentary. In general, fans of Wood and film fans are worth watching, but do not expect to be glamorous here. A documentary film made after Wood Heart.
