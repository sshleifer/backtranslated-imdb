This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, things were left in the mood of "life continues", which was hardly a shortened end deserved by this realist series. Although this was not a happy show, it always made you think (something rare on TV), and that's no exception. "Is death justified by reason?" "Does morality reflect society, or is society shaped by the ethics chosen by the few in power?" "What is just death, can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are brought up by the book this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Good representation, brilliant writing, wonderful camera work, great editing, clean direction. If you have watched the series and lost this command when you run it for the first time, get a copy one way or another. If you do not see the show at all, it will stand alone, but it may be difficult to try to keep up with all the characters and what they refer to in their diverse past. For those of us who have been hungry for the viewers of the series in the past two seasons, this is a very satisfying offer.
