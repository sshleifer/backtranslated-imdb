I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters dealt with the fact that there was a strong animal in their midst. The gorillas look great, and the eyes are particularly vibrant. It is a bit scary at times and children should be a little scared without going up. Rene Russo plays her wonderful female role. This type of Hollywood movie that happens in the past usually feels the need to create a deadly villain, but the only enemy is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we feel, yet how we can not really treat them like people because they do not. There is not much adventure film in this area and worth seeing if you want to think about the similarity between human and animal.
