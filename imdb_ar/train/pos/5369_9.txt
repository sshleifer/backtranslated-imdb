Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold plays the role of Ben Richards, a convicted man who hates to show "The Running Man," a deadly television show where people have to keep moving to try to escape the brutal death By "stalkers". Of course, people are expected to die eventually and it is up to Arnold to prove the system's fault. <br /> <br /> I have not read Steven King's book, but this is a great film regardless of one of Arnold's best films. He does what he does best in the role of the motor man, saving death with one of the unforgettable lines. The classics are probably "real pain in the neck" after a man strangled with barbed wire, and "had to be separated", referring to his whereabouts in a series that saw someone vertical. Dawson is very annoying as a TV presenter, and all "stalkers" are a suitable camp. Action is violent, but it is action movie. This is the whole point. The film is fast paced, and in 90 minutes it does not welcome him. <br /> <br /> With Starksky and Hatch Paul Michael Glaser on his head, made in the wake of The Terminator's success, the film was previously seen as just another stray move for Arnold, and was brought too far. But today, anyone watching a lot of television can see how the film approaches reality. I would not be surprised if you turn on the TV in the "near future" and saw an offer not far from it. <br /> <br /> In that sad observation, I recommend the "Running Man" to anyone who loves the 1980s, Arnold, silly or violent acts or just a good action film. 9. 5/10
