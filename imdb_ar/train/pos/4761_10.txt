Excellent movie with great offers from Zack & Lochley. Lots of displeasure (& me) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All due respect to Jerry Doyle but in seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy with the character.) It does not take long to start criticizing Zack (whom I like best in the show) and take responsibility. I'm sure Zach has dealt with him. The Soulhunter plot is fantastic, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. Humor completes well. 10/10
