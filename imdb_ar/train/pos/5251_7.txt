Well, "Wayne World" has long gone, and the years that followed were difficult for shooting films. One of those cinematic relics like "It's Pat" to 80-minute yawning, "A Night at the Roxbury," is no doubt that many have lost faith that any other short play will make a successful transition to the silver screen. Do not be afraid because Tim Meadows comes across the Pistons. The well-written plot keeps the attention of the public to the end and although it remains true to the character of Lyon Phelps, which was presented in the five-minute sitcom, the story of the story allows the character to evolve. Humor (which consists largely of sexual jokes) is new and interesting and made me laugh harder than I did in any film in modern memory. It's a great time if you do not want to take yourself seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thyssen's fame "Saved by the Bell", appears in the film and looks stunning. Finally, Billy De Williams, who recovers Colt 45 days, gives the film a touch of magnificence. For those who are quoting intellectual films like me, you will find that this film can be prominently quoted, "Oh, she's a lady!"
