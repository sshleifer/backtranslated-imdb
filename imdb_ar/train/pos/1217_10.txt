I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the figure of "Dark-Heart" is a bit on the hard side and I do not like the way it turns into an "average" frog, fox, boy? I was wrong, I made this film for my son and not for me. She "understood" when she went (under?) My head. Of course I do not get it. This is not one of the new children's movies that adults will also enjoy. This is true for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political unwanted ether. There is no magic key that saves the world from ourselves, no one has the right to excess access, and everyone is not happy all the time. As a side advantage, no one dies! ?? russwill.
