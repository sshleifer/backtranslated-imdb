I used this video and I was watching it last night. The acting started very bad (hey ------ hey ------ typhoon) but got very good soon after the wings. The hurricanes looked very fake, and many of the effects of CGI were very elusive, but the scene with the cracking of the house and the contents in the surrounding space and sucked it very well, on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of destruction were also very good. The story was well written, and it was refreshing to see such a stray movie away from the same old "disaster formula" films that seemed to have been suspended for 30 years. <br /> <br /> While this was a very strange mix of FX and quality of acting, this is worth A in my book.
