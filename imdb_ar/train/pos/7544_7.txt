Japanese animation enjoys a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that end up on hard drives fans for anime and college student floors, but are completely ignored by anyone outside of her the original. Cat soup is one of those films that the West is supposed to try out or analyze deeply. In fact, it is just a beautifully detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialog box, making it easy to move it to other interested parties who are not interested in things like translation. A cat and his half-dead sister (brain?) Travel through different landscapes of fantasy and association. There is a general theme of water, or lack thereof (perhaps because of the drowning of the cat at first? Perhaps because of the title?). There is an interesting type of Genesis to take. There is a pig gets to eat the same. An elephant made of water. It's great, attractive, sexy, and fun - provided you do not see it around drugs that can not experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. In the end, the movie is turned off, adding another level of strong self-reflection to the action. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
