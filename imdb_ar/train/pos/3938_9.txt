Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we had long believed that Abraham Lincoln was like. It's a trick. Through Fonda's performance, we intended to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was the beak of the country. But by confronting fanatical mobs, especially during court proceedings, you can see that under the outsiders he is a great man with good management of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a good understanding of how to humor. It is a part of it that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes he has perfect timing down. There is a sequence in the trial that made me laugh hard. This gift is presented again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> John Ford's finish is very impressive as Henry Fonda goes to the top of the hill and at a tremendous symbolic storm of civil war. Go forward in history. The film is fictional, but Lincoln's insight is enormous. Definitely worth seeing again.
