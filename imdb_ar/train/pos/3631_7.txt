The film actually has a fairly good story, but gets involved in many major places. It seems as though the director threw the film together without taking the time to make some of the key passages in the film. Dennis Quid plays a fairly decent role in his role ... but obviously there is something missing from many major scenes. <br /> <br /> The two-and-a-half hour film could have been reduced to about two hours. It might have been better to have a better film if he had not felt as if he had been thrown together. <br /> <br />
