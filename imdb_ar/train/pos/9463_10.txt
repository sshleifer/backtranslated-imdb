I loved Dan in Real Life. A wonderful story from a journey to love like You Got Got Mail or while you sleep, but not full of ironic jokes and jokes, not too romantic, they make you want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Stephen Carell) is a famous columnist who can not seem to recover things in his life. Until one day, at a family meeting / meeting, Mary meets and communicates immediately with Marie (Juliette Pinochet always beautiful), a wonderful sample of a woman who looks framed in a misty filter that hears his voice again to the classic movie stars. Chemistry occurs on a cup of tea and cakes, but Mary must be outside the previous sermon, and must separate them by ways. <br /> <br /> Later, we treated Dan's loving and cheerful relatives who not only ate great breakfasts together, but also enjoyed the use of Dan the Intelligent Gentleman as a heel for many single jokes. What I like most is that although the characteristics of the family can be considered abhorrent to some, I thought it was a wonderful picture of a large family do not risk ridicule or exaggerating mating. The Burns family is simply a loving group of people who are really interested in the best of Dan. There are fantastic family moments that are unrealistic. The family is curious, but never alive or chattering; quirky, but never strange. <br /> <br /> Dan falls in love with his brother's friend who brought her to the family gathering. Thus begins the roller coaster of self-control longing and funny budding love. <br /> <br /> I could have continued, but I thought this film was fantastic. It is not particularly "hip" or "smart", never smudge and do not care about the dry sense of humor or wit because many of the comedy movies in modern cinema. There is a beautiful balance between storytelling and funny but real dialogue. In fact, at the beginning of the film, the first spark of love begins with a strange discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation where characters say what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> So I probably stumbled and repeated myself, but I strongly recommend Dan in Real Life. It's a great history film, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're so obsessed with me, your eyes will be a bit fond. Filled with fun and magical love, Dan in Real Life will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 Stars Class: a
