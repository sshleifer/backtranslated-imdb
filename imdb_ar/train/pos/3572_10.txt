I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has lost a magic touch one way or the other. Many other renditions, ever put aside, have lost Cinderella, in fact, their touches over the years. Then I found this production flawlessly performed by Kathleen Turner as the wife of a wicked wife, and I was struck by the imaginary essence of this fantasy story that has thrown me under its influence since childhood. <br /> <br /> The story of Cinderella, a young girl whose father died and was taken over by her father's abusive wife and father's wives and eager to go to the ball for a last chance of freedom. But this plot takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing Cinderella (his real name is Zizola, the Cinderella family only because of slavery) to be trapped in the position of her father (who is still living slowly losing himself to a dominant wife manipulated by him To play favorite with his wife and his wife's daughters against his own country and try to poison him.Therefore, Zizola came out to save her father by preventing her father's wife from finding another caller on the ball by distracting the men who were going to her There, Prince Valian feels deeply bored of his boring life and falls in love The mysterious lady in the strange dress (which sa (Mab) with rose petals for the slippers. <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this film more than anything else is that the old Fairy Tale movie, which no one can compare, is woven into a network of lies like most Cinderella stories, and do not ignore any reason why Cinderella's desire to attend the ball and do not show a shallow aspect of the Prince as did the Disney version Instead, more of Cinderella's heart is more selfish than any other production and the artwork is stunning! All the costumes are beautifully designed, Especially the Zezola blue sapphire to match the beauty of her beautiful Marcella Blanchett and her soft, soul-like voice. <br /> <br /> I would strongly suggest this film to anyone interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic fantasy story with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a whole host of other fairy tales with the same element and the fact that the film has now run out.
