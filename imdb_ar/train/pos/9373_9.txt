Like many of you, I am very impressed with the real thing - the 1940s Noir films - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us and we crave the past. The term "new Nuer" has often been misused in the last 10 years to the point that it has lost its meaning and impact. John Dal's film on the other hand, really deserves to be described as such. The foundry is perfect everywhere, and he could have felt at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is too narrow to be hooked during the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain appreciates this. Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they do not make them as they were, and I am not that old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future with praise for the past.
