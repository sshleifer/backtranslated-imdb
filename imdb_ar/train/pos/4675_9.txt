I saw Brother Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later. The story of the lost son (Scott Cohen) returning to the furniture business for his family after spending time in prison, providing all the qualities necessary for a strong drama - memorable characters; sharp and committed dialogue; sensitive use of the camera by a director who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it offers something very rare in multiplying these days: an endless vision of mature sensibility. It seems that the talent of scriptwriter Todd S. Yellen appears fully, but we feel that he (like the protagonist) has paid his dues. He knows how to fight real people in this world, and know how to yearn to see success - or at least to experience success. Still, Yelin respects his audience more than the happy smoke blows to our far ends. In the end, we see that Jake's victory does not lie in commissions, or even in the estimation of his family, but in "work" he could not give up if he tried. <br /> <br /> A fundamental theme in a world (especially filmmaking) that can not rise above the "bottom line". This film deserves a wide audience.
