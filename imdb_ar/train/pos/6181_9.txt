A very fun movie, you can learn how to watch old musicals / ambiguities. It may not come close to the secrets of Agatha Christie or even the secrets of Thane Mann as a film nuer, but it is more interesting than "Boy meets a girl" or "Let's show in a musical show" behind the scenes. As a musician, there is no Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can promote "classic cocktails" for two and exotic "Sweet Marijuana". The film is shown in real time during a theatrical show, the opening night of "Vanity", where the murder - and soon another - is being discovered behind the scenes. Did you discover the killer before the fall of the curtain? Sure, but the search is enjoyable, although it is somewhat predictable and deplorably haunted by comic satisfaction (fortunately in the form of the girls goddess chorus, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a little stupid, the pilot hero very lovable, the leading lady very gracious, the Prima Donna prick is very tight, the sword is a little self-sacrificing sword, but as stereotypes go, they are very elegant. There are a group of really talented choir girls, who are chosen better than girls for Busby Berkley musical music in the same period, and who tend to be a bit on the plump side. Yes, it could have been a lot better than it is, and the Duke of Ellington is embarrassing, but if you enjoy diving in old movies, this is a very exciting journey.
