Okay. There are people who should not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not watch it if you do not like black humor or humor. 2) You do not like if you feel insulted by _The Watchmen_. 3) Do not watch it if you want a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Remaining, running, not walking, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's a strange thing, it's a delightful dispatch to every evil superstition known to man. Occasional invasions to the beginner humor do not spoil the fun of Jinan Garvalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple of smaller entertaining parts of Jeffrey Rush and Greg Kenner. (It's good to see Louise's family getting a job, too). I laughed all the way. Not quite serious, somewhat bizarre, but good.
