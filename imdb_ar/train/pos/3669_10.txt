This film captures the absurd essence of the arrogant American national actor - whose work and politics are believed to be of crucial importance to the American people, like the president himself. Alan Bates captures this mentality just like Michael Bates, and I will remember that Bates Khalid is this character. This film is for Canadians and Americans alike. It is a valuable piece of cinema, able to attract its audience through the magic of the film industry and reveals how easily product loss and outright control of the will of representatives and innumerable external powers. It is impressive that the Hollywood North does not suffer from the subject that it depicts: Peter O'Brien directs with complete control and takes over all of the dangerous "behind the scenes" part of the film, and the film inside the film "Journey to Bogota" is clear and clear. If you are ever interested in the intelligence and power of Canadian cinema, the "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
