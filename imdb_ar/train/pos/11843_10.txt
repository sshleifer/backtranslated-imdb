Spirit: The stallion of Semaron is a wonderful film overall. The combination of unique animation types, wonderful story telling, and wonderful music. <br /> <br /> Animation is a special thing about many animations. How they express characters, especially horses, through their animations is particularly spectacular. While the method of connecting horses through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I imagine it should be difficult to express through features. For this reason, I understood the "eyebrow" they added to the horses (while the real horses did not have those thick lines). One of the few things I have noticed about horse habits that may have been filmed strangely is that Spirit leads his mother's herd. In herds of wild horses, the main mule usually stalks small ponies. <br /> <br /> Also, while some people may think of portraying White Army officers as "bad guys," all the films in which Native Americans are portrayed as such are thought of. Sometimes at that time they did treat the fort very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa strain was almost eliminated because of army officers. Imagine what could have happened to one of the best horseback riding breeds in the world if the Native Americans did not save them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realism is not raised by making horses talking to each other. Soul feelings were expressed through a little narration, but mostly through music (by Brian Adams). The songs express a really good story, and Hans Zimmer and Brian Adams did a great job of telling the story through tunes and songs. <br /> <br /> The passion I got when watching the movie, whether it was the first or the first time (yes, I've seen it a lot), you will not believe it. Some scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears on your eyes. The opening sequence, which displays Spirit's habitat, puts you directly into stunning action immediately. <br /> <br /> I never understand why some people are angry at this wonderful film. Overall, I rate 10/10 - you should watch.
