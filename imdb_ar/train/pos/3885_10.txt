I first met Eddie by friends from Across the Pool knowing that I loved smart humor. I prefer comedians who can think of provoking them during entertainment like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress to Kill", Eddie offers the same kind of social commentary humor that motivates your thoughts on a subject all the time, leading to your separation at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this position which are simply hysterical. The piece will make you how to determine the stage name in Engelbert's stitches! <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have knowledge?"
