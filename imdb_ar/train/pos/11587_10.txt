I love this movie quite and really want to get it someday. It's just a wonderful legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and wanted to see it again! I do not remember much about it, but the original American boy lives in a beautiful village with his family. I do not remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out into the wild alone. His sister packed some food and went. While he is out there, some other Indian boys come out and put on some feathers and turn into an eagle. Legend says that if you see a tiger wearing a turquoise necklace, he is the boy. I was always fascinated by legends, especially the original American legends, and I would love to see this version released one day on DVD, please release it, who cares!
