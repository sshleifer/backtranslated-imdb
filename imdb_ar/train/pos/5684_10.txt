Wonderland is a wonderful film that tells the story of Hollywood star John C. Holmes, who is rated x in the wild murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Promoting the film misleads one into thinking about this romantic image of the porn industry in the context of this is not the case here. In fact, with the exception of some of the signals made by news anchors that John Holmes is a porn star and a short montage of realistic footage of John Holmes, this film is a stark drama about the participation of celebrities who were killed with the murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being misled, the film is really attractive. REPRESENTATION OF ALL REPRESENTATIVES Excellent I would say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the behaviors of John Holmes. I was quite convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes was looking at and was acting in real life. <br /> <br /> If you love John C. Holmes or Hollywood stories then I think you will enjoy watching Wonderland.
