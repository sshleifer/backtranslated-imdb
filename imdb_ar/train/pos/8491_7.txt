I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after spending three years here, I am afraid to be exposed because I see it in the harsh light of my extensive international experience. I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of his portrayal of the cultural conflict between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). Not all things actually exist, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I'm still in Japan several years later, and I still enjoy this film for its fair treatment of both sides of the story. Interestingly, even though Japanese-American actors originally spoke Japanese, the dialogue was reopened in Japan's version of the cover-up of obvious second language problems. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a reviewer uses this in the Japanese language class. . I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie by reading any of the "serious" books on the issue (most of which were written in the 1980s and funded through the promotion of Japanese companies). <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by dragging on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who have found, among other things, that it is unreasonable that the Japanese want to make cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese run many factories there to be close to customers and avoid commercial friction.) This movie is very cozy and funny and I would rate it higher for a few cliches, like dancing around for cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been more entertaining.
