I saw this movie on the Hulmark channel, and I thought it was wonderful, especially because it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the only Englishman who took the character of half of the Gray Dynasty owl. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie has made me do more research on this character, known as Archie Belaney, known as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At that time I did not know that Richard Attenborough had his face. But I'm not surprised. I love all his movies whether acting or directing. I gave it the highest rating. However, I wanted to see more in the film about why this person was taken because he showed only the two girls he had set up and his room in their house. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong in this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and inventive special effects every few minutes.
