The only reason to give this film 8 out of 10 is that there are a few films, in my opinion, perfect. This small B picture is a tight story. Alexander Knox has always been fascinated by me, but I have seen very few films. Here Wilhelm Grimm plays, a sad little man turning into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without remorse. Performance is one of the most chilling offerings I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who have played the role of Nazis or other evil have sometimes been nominated for Oscar awards. I imagine that since this was done during the war, the academy felt like a tribute to such a performance was like honoring evil. But Knox puts this kind of performance - a very bitter man who consumes guilt so much that he does not think anything to make others suffer. I still can not overcome them. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the role of Philbert or the Social Butterfly, is opposed to the genre in the best performance I have ever seen. Perhaps Oscar is not worth, but better than her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed her in these "minor" roles she often plays. But they prove to be the task of the heaviest drama. <br /> <br /> If you love stories of human drama, or stories about the fate of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I strongly recommend this little film.
