This movie is great fun. I advise you to watch it yourself and then see it again with your friends. I did last night and it was amazing how Norma Khoury managed to attract everyone to her world! I felt a bit strange when I saw my friends going through the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the film. You know it's a great movie if you spend two hours after talking about the film! <br /> <br /> I once saw an impostor up to the level of Norma Khoury, but there is nothing near the same size ring. He's a fool of a very naive and rich people in my old Berkeley CA A.A. A group where everyone trusts everyone. He "patronized" only people who seemed to do well. Who knew he had stolen more than 100,000 (in 1987 when it was real money) after spending a month in the city. His victims were very fragile as they were in the first month or week of being sober. He was wicked with a great laugh and a wonderful smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khoury did with her old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything away. <br /> <br /> I think, I found this night in a late-night movie channel, "Showtim" I think. This is always the greatest experience for film lovers being completely fooled to see something and blow your mind. Just drag your friends to see it and do not tell them anything. It's a very fun film, it moves fast and never has. <br /> <br /> This must be a classic world movie at all times. I think all the wonderful films are finally rising to the top. Time will be very good for this film. I'm sorry because no one has heard of them yet, some of the ways that make the surprises better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were wonderful. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie!
