Since the title is in English and IMDb is the primary language of this presentation in English, I will focus on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as shown in the Bandai DVD collection. My actual assessment of the entire series is IMDb "Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W" (1995). <br /> <br /> Very little change has been made regarding the scheme and the scenario and its description of adaptation to English really depends on your taste in choosing the language you would like to see in this show. Extremists can hold onto the Japanese with all they want, but to get a more "realistic" experience I recommend the English track because all the characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese (mostly Caucasians in fact with two non-Japanese Asians). "Direct" more than the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take presentations, but a wonderful selection of actors. <br /> <br /> Wing Pilot Gundam Hiro Yue is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. Deadpan's delivery can be criticized as "bad behavior" but it matches the character of Heero very well. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe's Gundam's Duo Maxwell, always cheerful in the face of death, is offered a training course in assessing the value of life and friends. Possibly the best actor in the whole show, Scott McNeill plays brilliantly. He may sound too big for his age, but the sound of Duo in English easily classifies his annoying Japanese voice. <br /> <br /> Troy, a heavy pilot, is a lonely lost spirit whose only goal has so far been fought; despite his inner desire to form connections with people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to ratify. Kirby Morrow presents a sad and realistic performance like Trois Barton. <br /> <br /> The voice of Brad Swail, winner of Quattar Rappara who has no difficulty in clarifying the nature of the character and destroying his innocence, suffers from atrocities of war and death directly. One more point is that Quater no longer looks like a girl (and yes his voice is represented in the Japanese version) but a typical good-faith man of 15 years. <br /> <br /> Wadei Chang, expressed by Ted Cole, may look a bit higher, but in stark contrast to the quieter roles of Hierro and Hiroa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian seems to be older in English, expressed by Lisa. Anne Bailey. This may not be good with her early youthful portrayal of the series, but as her character matures later in the story, her voice follows suit and ends up very well with the evolution of character. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise is one of the most radical voices compared to the Japanese version. Both sounds highlight different aspects of the same character. His Japanese voice is respected, trusted, respected and in line with his high status and charismatic nature. His voice in English by Brian Drummond is calmer, as it seems more perverted and "snake-like", highlighting the secret nature of Zechs with regard to his hidden schedules and strong beliefs. <br /> <br /> OZ members are really mixed bag. Triz Kuchetrenada, which David Cay has expressed, was given a more realistic and progressive performance than his style of speaking Japanese. However, Une does not convey her split personality as in the Japanese version, while Lucrencia Noin seems just ......... bored most of the time. Feed pilots and military commanders are not something to talk about either. <br /> <br /> I appreciated it if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. Maganac Corp's voice was generally uninspiring but could have been more interesting if it had been given accents from the Middle East. Romerfeller members seemed to be better off with some high-end European touches that reflected their nobility. <br /> <br /> In spite of the stunning representation of the side characters, the main team managed to carry the presentation and its results in a less realistic and comprehensive presentation than the Gundam Wing texts. Very faithful to the original Japanese text, while preserving all the basic ideas that raise ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the original Japanese script errors.
