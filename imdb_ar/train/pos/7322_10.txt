Halloween is one of those movies that make you a deep skin! Is in my opinion, the most terrifying film of all time. Michael Myers is the best man ever! It was very scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects where you can figure out how to move it to a computer. It was low budget and had one note, but it managed to scare the hell out of people. 25, and still has the same effect as in 78. <br /> <br /> It is about Michael Myers' boy, killing his sister at the age of six, and several years later running away from the mental institution. Dr. Sam Lomis is behind him and will do his best to bring him back, because he describes Michael as "... pure evil, darkest eyes, devil's eyes". Michael on a mission though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by Jimmy Lee Curtis new. She has to sit on Halloween, her friends are out of concerts and of course we know the rules, they get them! But Laurie may stand the chance because she is a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween celebrates many characters, we have another character named Sam Lomis and Jamie Lee Corres, the daughter of Janet Lee. Halloween is a very cool movie that breaks the boundaries and makes you close the doors and close your windows and turn off the lights! "They'll get you! They'll get you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
