Oh, what a pleasure here! <br /> <br /> Amy Hickering has a penchant for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who Talking) but here it seems she told the actors to go out and enjoy. Michael Keaton describes Johnny's role, which is his best screen performance easily. Joe Piscobo is as wonderful as Danny Fermin, which the directors did not get out of it. I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moroni and the unique vocabulary of the character. I do not think it is a coincidence that the bulk of the personal name is written on MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines have been laid throughout the film, with Peter Boyle and Griffith Donne. . Even actors with simple roles like Dick Potcus and Alan Hill line up in good queues. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
