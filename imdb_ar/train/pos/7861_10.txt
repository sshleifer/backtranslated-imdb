Uneducated and challenging, beautiful Tess storm country is the daughter of a hunter squatting on the land of a rich man. It is courageous and daring, embodying the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death are what her immediate future will be chasing before she can claim the peace of beautiful happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Beckford is absolutely charming in this amazing and wonderful film of the heart. She considered Tess her favorite role and she was filled with all the joy and courageous enthusiasm that for years made her the most famous film star in the world. The story contains all the essential elements of a modern fairy tale, with Mary the beautiful and faltering heroine who suffers from all kinds of dangerous and stressful situations. The atmosphere is first class, with the outdoor fishing village very well designed. <br /> <br /> In the supporting film, Jean Herschault stands out as the evil villain who is trying to force Beckford to marry him. Herschelt, a very nice screen, was able to work brilliantly to portray the complete moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> This was the second time that BECKFORD was portrayed as TESS. The 1914 version was one of her first important films, but her production values ​​were somewhat old by the 1920s (without close-ups, for example) and Mary, who produced her own films and strong enough by 1922 to make anything she wanted, decided for the only time Her career to reproduce the film. The final result is certainly up to its expectations. Both films were popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A fascinating study of some future cinema researchers will be the impact of Christianity on the life of Mary Beckford. It certainly resembles the golden thread through the silent films it produced. Although the romance inherent in the nature of the silent cinema itself may cause these spiritual feelings to appear somewhat strange today, we are forced to accept them as reflections, truthfully, of their repetition of Mary's heartfelt beliefs. In TESS, a particularly beautiful scene emerges in this regard: Beckford teaches herself to read using the Bible. She refers to Lloyd Hughes (who plays her lover) with a word near the back of the book she does not understand. He was imitating her (obviously the word "crucified"), and her eyes turned to heaven as the full meaning of her sacrifice was shown, Mary's face becomes a positive adventurer. <br /> <br /> A wonderful new orchestral degree TESS was provided by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, who fully emphasizes the beauty and lament of this wonderful film.
