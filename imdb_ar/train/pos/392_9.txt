The legend of Zou, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many people who did not like them did not see the myths behind the film. They were expecting something closer to Star Wars, and it was not. I think Joseph Campbell liked this movie. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that might have been ignored by the ordinary viewer. We all have a mountain of swords inside us. We all have to enter our cave blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face insomnia someday. Granted some of the narration was a little confusing, and I got some of the work a bit at times, but I think the other points of the film are easily compensated. I was watching him again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors. The masses, which would really detract from this the movie.
