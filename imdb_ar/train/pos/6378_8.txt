Atlantis: The Lost Empire contains some of the best and most elegant animations and cleverly written dialogue in any Disney movie I have ever seen. I was convinced that in the first 15 minutes. I particularly like Don Donello's voice work on Vincento Santorini and Phil Morris as the Cogucha Strongyber Sweet. The entire film seems to be moving very badly at twice the rate that would be appropriate - at least in the first chapter. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a sick one - not offered by Atlantis. It is average at best. In the middle of the film, there is a modest development. That's all. It's a wonderful movie though. Everyone should check it out.
