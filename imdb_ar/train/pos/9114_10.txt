Given the lack of art in African cinema (or black American cinema). Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community dedicated to covers and dealers. But the funny thing is that this is not a focus at all or even a short subject. But the most independent assertion of independence from these issues is the insistence. This type is unique and not typical. It is this departure that draws attention first, so watching it twice is crucial. The film has an aesthetic quality that gives room to the real art of cinema. <br /> <br /> This real art is very rare sound. The film does not copy to achieve its mission, it innovates and provokes by attracting hidden stereotypes (not racist stereotypes but based on characters), from the point of view of the book, the film is wonderful. It carries double messages which include a very fast personal development. You must remember that this movie is less than 10 minutes and that it is able to create a character very quickly. The use of colors, texture and music is also commendable. But looking at the way out, Owen Alik Shahadah's latest project, 500 years later, the music will be expected. But from an objective point of view, the idea seems to be a departure, but the irony gets away from the social problem indirectly - great things!
