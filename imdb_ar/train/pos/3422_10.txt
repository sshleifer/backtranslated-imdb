I badly need this on the bar, not on the DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> My nephew is in infantry but has not yet spread, although he is ready to go to Iraq after December 2008. My son lost the beloved step in Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile In a green area. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduated from high school this spring because, like his older brother, he has a perfect and romantic idea of ​​what army service is. Rebbetti died 10 days later in the country and never got out of a job, so my nephews can not point to any of the experiences described in this candid documentary of any kind of personal experience that my deceased son may have conveyed. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do about those who are or are now gone, but I have one left that has not been raised and sworn in so far. I strongly want him to do so knowing, and did not do any of the others. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to help me with this. <br /> <br /> The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I've ever seen. I need to make my younger nephew somehow see what he will get before he gets late. But: (do not laugh) I need my mom to see this first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not just an idea of ​​them, but the fact of what they will be immersed in, forever. Then she will have the emotional will to make my brother watch this movie, and once he has permission, his son, my younger nephew, may make his own. Then, my nephew might start to take this seriously. If so, please tell us when?)) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is that my mom does not Having a DVD player, they still use video (is that true? With bars?) So, I need to find a way for them to watch this movie. Can I buy this from anyone in this form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a bar from anyone? Is there any legitimate link I can download on my computer and then move it to a tape. If so I call him. I will gladly pay the privilege provided it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I'll think about anything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've lost one fan and really loved one, and I already know that my older nephew will never be the same when he comes back and I've lost him too. I can not lose three, and the emotional toll of all those who return them is very high price to pay for every male child in my family of this generation. Please help me. I'll happily call you, send me an email number if this is the best way to get the information you need. Thank you very much for any help you can provide. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
