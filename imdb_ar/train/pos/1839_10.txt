Excellent movie about two policemen loving the same woman. She was killed by one of the policemen (Périer), but all evidence seems to condemn the other (Montand). Montand does not know the unlucky one who is the other lover who could have killed her, and Périer does not know that Montand had anything to do with the girl. Must Montand find the killer ... And what a wonderful end! Highly recommended.
