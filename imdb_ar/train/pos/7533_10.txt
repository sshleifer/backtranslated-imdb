I liked this series when it was at Kids WB, and I could not believe that there was a show for Batman when the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all, I liked the idea of ​​leaving Robin for Batman to solve the crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in serial, and again like my predecessor, this offer had fantastic story lines, fantastic animations (better than original), great sound work and brilliant writing of course. The only thing I did not like was that when he was in the US, the episodes were run in a 15 minute story. I hope some episodes are longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon in the series, "Over the Edge", is good if it's not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robining Recuping." Overall a nice follow up, along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
