Man, if anyone expects a great zombie movie after reading this title, you are underdeveloped and deserve to be disappointed. For me, I was expecting a flick of the low-budget zombie and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a wonderful movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all of the zombies have just turned, so they are fresh undead zombies. Obviously they did it because it would be very expensive if they did a complete Forex zombie. I understand it all, I have no idea how anyone can understand this film seriously. It is called "Hood of Living Dead" for the love of God! Do you watch "Redneck Zombies" and any Uwe Boll movie and really expect it to be great? of course not! So why are there some gowns on IMDb whining like school girls around this movie, I will never understand. Oh, yes, there are worse movies there, so stop saying that this was the worst I've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! Have you ever seen "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "house of the dead" ???? Those are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you can not see that it's just a low-budget zombie film made clearly by zombie movie lovers, that's wrong with you. I enjoyed it. Excellent from me and I also want to see a supplement.
