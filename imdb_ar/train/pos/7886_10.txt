Well, I admire the Nightmare series and everyone says here that this is the worst! But it is not! Do not see revenge Freddie ??? WTF! This was the worst thing !!! Now this movie is very decent and adheres to Freddie's story and it is wonderful to have a daughter ect. <br /> <br /> Then I discovered that it's in 3D! I was very excited, and I remember that when I saw him on a DVD box, I immediately skipped to a three-dimensional sequence. There was a lot in 3D, like Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean with a knife, Lisa Zane with Bateball Bat, Doc's, and Fred's's explod. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie because it was three-dimensional, but I hope that the entire film is three-dimensional not only in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes and not ten !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
