Very funny film. A funny classic film Eddie Murphy of the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, funny film, well done. In the 1980s, Murphy made several motion pictures that, for him, were a way of joking about everything that was dangerous. The result can only be estimated by some but the second film from 1986 until now has changed. The atmosphere for the film at that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of that period. A beautiful film to see and enjoy the taste of Murphy's irony, the actor who recently disappeared. The final part is the anthology, the beloved actor who plays the Tibetan monk. This is.
