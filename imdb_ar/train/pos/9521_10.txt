I think this movie is wonderful. There are many reasons why but these are some of them 1) Good acting by Tom and Tyler 2) The sight of the machine gun was brilliant was a wonderful piece 3) I thought the end was a good twist because I never expected to be credited in the end to Sam Mendes. In these three points, the format of the film is also good. I was a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I have seen in many years. I would like to thank all the people involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the film is the scene of the machine gun where John Rooney is killed. It's just a complete brilliance in silently shooting until John Rooney says, "I'm happy because you are." , And this sound is quite different for all the wonderful scenes only. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Russ Kirk at the age of 16
