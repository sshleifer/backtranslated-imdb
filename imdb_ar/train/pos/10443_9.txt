The beautifully designed Richard Linclitter's mix of young romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90 best romantic thinking films. Julie Delby turned out to be one of the most impressive shows of the decade, as a Parisian girl spent a day with Ethan Hawk from a stranger on the train. The dialogue (and rumors from it) is extraordinarily tortuous, but this image of two young fans who wish to make a romantic, intellectual and spiritual relationship with each other is full of amusing moments and wonderful insight.
