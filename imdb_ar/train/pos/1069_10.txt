I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after I spent a few episodes of the first season on Channel 5. I no longer have anything about the versatility of the show. I have not enjoyed anything since Firefly (also an amazing view). I will admit that the second season was not good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see: Eye of the game, Bag 'em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.), and Alec is fantastic. I have heard some plans for a possible third season, and I must say, I can not believe it has been canceled - I will not spoil it for you - but it would shake! I also think it has a lot of potential as a film (although at the moment it seems very unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452. In the past two weeks, I had three episodes away from watching the classes twice. It's very very good.
