Bakkal is doing well here - especially since this is her second film only. This success is often overshadowed by two great successes: "You Have and Do not Have Them" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one does not live up to other films but I think through no fault of its own. I think there are some mistakes in filming a British lady in the upper crust. No tone at all. I think all the strange dialects were scattered - Boer was certainly not Spain. It was hard to keep up the country that people belong to. <br /> <br /> I really liked filming black and white movies. The mood is used for great influence - I especially liked the fog scene. Lighting also does a great job of adding to intrigues and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is awesome. Boyer does not fit the role of a leading romantic guy for me - so he and Bacall were a bit strange together. Not great in chemistry - and certainly not the magic of Puji and Bacall. But I still love this picture. There is great tension as it moves well enough. I must say I found that killing a small girl is very bold in this film that goes back to a period. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxino and Peter Laurie stand out in their support team. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is very deceitful and evil in filming. Her only scene in which he laughs obsessively while Mr. McIrgi leaves after exposing her to the child killer is very worrying. Laurie's performance is very good in his portrayal of the snake to the contreras - a cowardly fool until the end. Wanda Bendrix also works very well in the portrayal of the Else child - especially since this is her first photograph and was only 16 years old (although she looks younger). It turned out that she later married Auie Murphy who proved to be a short-lived marriage.
