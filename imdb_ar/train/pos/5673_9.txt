I think "Blackadder the Third" is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Actuelly All episodes are funny, and I personally like the episode with "The French Invasion", but the episode with the legendary actors, in the "MACBETH" is really funny, the way Rowan continues to play with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Cast: "Do not say that again, and always let him play Scottish; Blackadder: Oh, then you want to say a Scottish play? Cast: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> < I'm a fan of Brown and I have most of his work, but I think he did the Blackadder series very well. <br /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his wonderful style, but I think we can count on him, because he's already working on Bean 2, which will end this year, I can not wait. <br /> <br /> This gave Blackadder 3 a rating of 9 of 10.
