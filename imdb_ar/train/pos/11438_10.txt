Ralph and Mumford, uninformed in their land, were tricked into being inadvertent pianos from Synanomess Botch. Twice a time is the story of them, the characters you meet, and their struggle to set things right. With the impressive soundtrack and the wonderful sound of some of the best players in the field, this strange film hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process, while similar to the South Park style, is much smoother and much more 3D. If I did not know that the animation was on this pattern, I would swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, please do! You will not miss anything really if you do not, but if you do, you'll get more experience!
