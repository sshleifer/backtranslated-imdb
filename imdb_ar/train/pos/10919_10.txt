The "Five Deadly Poison" is not as bloody and violent as the "Ricky Story" or "Super Ninja," but it contains some of the best direct fighting sequences in the history of Hong Kong films. Director Zhang Chih creates what many consider his masterpiece. This film released the careers of the five men playing poison. Meng Lu plays another bad ass. He was going to be in Super Ninjas. Ko Kuoi who is Philip Cook will continue in the storyline of Ricky and Hard Hardcore. Any sock stamping fan can apperciate this. But I still think it is not as good as the Super Ninjas (also introduced by Zhang Chih). But each socky seal is good and this is one of the very best.
