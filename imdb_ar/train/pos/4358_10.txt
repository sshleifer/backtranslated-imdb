Well, maybe this movie deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help offset the misleading evaluation from a bunch of Bozo who gave this movie a zero rating or one rating for the stars. Each part of this collection shows great potential for talented directors ... three of them have achieved remarkable success in Hollywood productions. The offerings range from very approximate to very impressive, with the famous cornerings of Bill Paxton, James Carin, Vivian Schilling and Bryon James. Martin Cove may be Melodramia as great as the hypnotist of the powerful flashlight headlight, and it seems that August Lance has deliberately dwindled as an unexpected laboratory victim. But in general, she got some great laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge yourself!
