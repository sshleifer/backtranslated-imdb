When this came out for the first time after 6 months of tragedy, I did not want to see it. I did not want to open the old wounds. I am sorry about that. Now I've seen the movie. Praise be to Allaah. This shows you the courage of all FDNY and NYPD. I love you. I offered to close. I can now go ahead with my life.
