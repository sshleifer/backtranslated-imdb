Wonderful. I loved the whole chain and was shocked by the comments made by people who thought it had ended badly. Maybe a little shaken in Seasons 4 and 5, while I stayed better than anything else on TV. But 6 and especially 6b were pretty variations on subjects that were developed in the first three more muscular seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B began with a melancholy mood and Janice's gaze was always keen on the family's anxiety - this line full of tragedies about knowing Tony's inclination to sit and stare. Anyone missing the repercussions for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Milfie is alarmed by psychological study and her references to feelings of self-deception of pets and pet animals to the first episodes of the series, for example, with Tony's panic attack on the ducks who left his bath and hesitated with the "wave" of an elephant. Goodbye "to the row of grandchildren before the coup on the grace of the last episode (not going into the dark chase). <br /> <br /> I could have gone on, but I will add that I thought the last offer - starting with the opening lines of Vanilla Fudge ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") At the end moments where Tony fades away with his family in a state of complacency or bangs like the AJ SUV or Phil Header, it was, perfectly, perfectly perfect ... The best TV ever. > Very good in the midst of satisfactorily equipped death "Inverted fantasies" AJ makes fun of them (and then retracts them immediately).
