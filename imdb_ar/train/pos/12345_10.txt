Kurosawa weaves a tale that contains a variety of characters, like any Shakespearean drama, and the representation applies to the story, where each star plays his role as part of the larger story. It's impressive, funny and interesting all over. Personal development is close to perfection, vivid and attractive cinema, and the story draws you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "samurai's imagination" and those obsessed with capturing the 18th and 19th centuries in Japanese tales may ignore this film because it is not the best work of Kurosawa. Probably not the best he has, but even at its worst, Kurosawa is better than a lot of the best. This story is based on raising the earthly life of ordinary people at a time when time is changing dramatically, although it was set in the not too distant past. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this to any buff film, especially for those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
