I just finished viewing version 139 minutes (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown up. I will not bother repeating what others have said. What filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and enjoyable. The huge battle is cumbersome. After that, we were shocked when we discovered that there was still about 30 minutes of the day, but that did not stop us from participating and entertaining completely. song's music. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used, we all laugh. It's hideous. You've been warned, but the story and storytelling keeps you on the ground. <br /> <br /> There are several wonderful moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow photography that works beautifully. I really wish I could erase the music but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you do not expect and that's very refreshing.
