This movie is absolutely ridiculous. Not only is it a terrible plot, but the representation is appalling. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is by far the most entertaining film that has been licensed to produce it. It's 101 minutes of laughter because of the fact that we all know that there will be no fuel in 3000, or any kind of camino. There are also other aspects that will not spoil them, just because they are making movies that are very sterile. I highly recommend this film, just because of its absolute folly. I have no idea who will see this expected to be a high-quality feature, but if good laugh is what you need, be sure to watch Genocide pesticides in 3000!
