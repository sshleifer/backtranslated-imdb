Anyone who finds this movie boring, it is a desperate return must adhere to the chase movies and romantic comedy series. This film is installation and has no dull moment. why? Because it consists largely of intelligent dialogue between real people at the moment of crisis and details of their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is what distinguishes almost all Romer films, which is why many people do not like it. They prefer to work. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to search for movies like this. <br /> <br /> Romer has long been accused of being "talkative." Well, it is, but for me this is a compliment, not a cash. Shakespeare was talkative, too. Is there a talkative play of "Hamlet"? When a theme or theme of art consists of ideas and disagreements about values, there must necessarily be discussion about these ideas and values, and that is what this film is about. The value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who has that life is not very pleasant, or even despicable. . (Anyone ever hear of Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") That's what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The error in these two films is not in this film, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who speaks English and speaks French as her second language, is particularly fascinating. Do yourself a favor and see this installation movie. May be the last movie of this Master screen.
