I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where it received a warm welcome! This film tells a story that was never told before - specifically about the Rosenstrasse (Berlin Street) of German women of Almaty who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such, it is a unique story, and more than that, it is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen showing that there were good Germans (the family helped in Anne Frank, for example Dutch) who did not support the Nazis, Indeed, the steadfastness of standing in the face of the brutality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, is at risk to their lives. The representation is superb in all areas, and the framing story in New York is interesting and complex, and the trend of the ingenious iPhone Trotta in every scene, production values, including gorgeous, outstanding cinematic photography. Of course the family in New York can speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak their mother tongue with their families - a common occurrence. Therefore, this criticism is unjustified. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long, but I did not look at my watch once. I hope this film has some distribution in North America, because it is not only a masterpiece, but it can help heal any animosity among the Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is played in your area, I encourage you to watch it! You'll be glad you did!
