The sudden effect was generally better than the Enforcer in my opinion. It was good to be a great film, but then I saw the villain and the disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact was different from previous installments. The plot went in a different direction in this film, as Dirty Harry does not take much of the police approach this time. Also we do not see villain (bad guys) until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for all of us. . Pat Hengel was delighted as Chief Jannings, Harri's new president. Bradford Dillman seemed to have changed his name to Captain Briggs here, in both cases, he was no different. Michael Corrie is respectable like Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry's annoying head. I personally enjoyed Kevin Major Howard as Hawkins, the young villain who has vengeance against Harry. Albert Bobwell was excellent like Horace, Harry's friend. Audrie J. Neenan was as good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian all over town. Jacques Thibault was a good representative of Kruger. Now for the part really bad. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time mistress was as awful as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's Love. Paul Drake was just as awful as Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie was much better if not for better writing and acting in some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
