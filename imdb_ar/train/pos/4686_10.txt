This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is because he is not afraid to research some politically incorrect topics (such as beatings on women and submission to females) that other major films are too shy. Nothing seems to be prohibited in this film where the director develops the story freely without any interest in insulting the viewer. However, I do not think anything was done here just to shock or offend anyone intentionally. Shawn Young turns in an excellent and brave performance. Most major actresses have not taken this role or requested some major script changes before accepting it. Other members perform well as well. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie has not appeared on the cable paid for a short mandatory period a year after arriving at the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it does not fit the current political climate. It seems ironic to me that some of the privileged channels now have an erotic revelation (closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a major film such as "Love Crimes." Unfortunately, although the film is only 11 years old, it is unlikely to be produced today. <br /> <br />
