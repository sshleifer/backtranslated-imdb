Robert Duvall and Glenn Claus played their part with great credibility. The role of Glenn Claus in Ruth's role showed her willingness to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's control. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duval, Joe's character, strongly. The story depicts a rural family dealing with the death of a son accidentally by his brother, the "Stone Boy," which means he was too terrified and dizzy to do, and was paralyzed emotionally. And finally, when I left Jason Bresson, Arnold, everything to a stranger, I was shocked at him, so much so that I thought of some horrible things I had done in my life. I figure and identify it with his personality. Frederick Forest and Jill Youngs did not add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forest, who played the role of Ruth's teenage brother Ruth, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Jill Youngs, acted like a crazy lady who was frustrated by Arnold's own problems without pity and blamed him for her problems. I could not be sorry for those two. Although if she tried to keep her marriage together, it did not work. Both have not dealt with their problems effectively. They did not really do anything in the film and they were totally ridiculous. Wilfried Brimley's role was as simple as his age, and his touch was the only character that showed Arnold's interest. I felt that his role had to be detailed. The players did only what they felt was sufficient and sufficient. However, she loved the end so much, she had already smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans has family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were very realistic.
