Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. You do not expect production values ​​for the version, but do not expect the highest quality for direct release to the video. <br /> <br /> Set up with Timon & Pumba starting to see the original Lion King in a dark theater and suddenly switching paths and start telling their story. This is done with frequent comedic interruptions. For example, during a tense moment, a commercial advertisement appears at home and Bomba is disillusioned that he sat on the remote control. These small moments flake the film, and whether you find it amusing or not, it will depend to a large extent on your sense of humor. If you are particularly upset by movies that deliberately mention that the viewer is watching a movie, this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best they've invested in the Disney DTV line, and has been almost seamlessly integrated with the original material. The new and independent material uses much of the original technique. All the vocal talent is good performing, although I could not think of Marg Simpson every time I heard where Julie Cavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be well recognized by the viewers as they have been recycled over generations, but more familiar with the quirky quirks of old friends than the annoying repetitions. <br /> <br /> The music made me realize how much I enjoyed and missed a good musician integrated with the Disney feature. The opening feature of the "Dig A Tunnel" is characterized by a thin and cheerful design. Timon and Bomba take the opening series "Lion King" and their introduction to Paradise is also entertaining. The only problem was to remake "Dig A Tunnel" at the end of the film, turning his words and tone from defeatism to elevation. <br /> <br /> The story line has been well accomplished and the new integration elements of the chart are done almost perfectly, although the last thing during the hyena repels the credibility of the story a bit. The new story does not seem to deal with emotionally charged or emotionally charged moments, and it is better when it resorts to full comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, worth buying. If you love all the bonus features that come with a typical set of two disks, look for it. For a shark who is still willing to invest in a good click, wait until you drop four dollars or more and go rent it right away. <br /> <br /> Damon Crowley.
