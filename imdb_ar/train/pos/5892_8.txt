Thomas Ince always had the talent to bring simple homespun stories to life full of taste. "Italian" is such a film. Strong representation, especially by George Pippan, the father of the silent actor George Pippan Junior, and the wonderful collections convey a realistic sense of early immigrant housing in New York. This 1915 film gives an extraordinary originality in the features of this classic film. <br /> <br /> The film starts with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we turn to the story with George playing the immigrant. He collects enough money to bring his fianc√©e from Italy to America, marry her, and have a son. But the times are tough and the family is struggling to survive. I found myself wondering why the mother did not breastfeed her child and avoided the complications of the dirty formula, but well, even the early dreams factory was pushing the correct political behavior of women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has an opportunity to seek revenge from a criminal leader who accidentally put him in prison, and at the last minute decides not to follow his path. Very stylish. I loved the curtain effect, it was fantastic. Great use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give Italian 8 out of 10.
