This is the first CG animated film I've ever seen. Normally, watching other animated movies made me reluctant to see it. Not Ice Age. I wanted to see him the moment I saw the video with Scrat, the funny little squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was intermittently funny and a generally enjoyable film to watch. The story is basically a animated version of Three Men and a Child, developed 20,000 years ago. The pictures were wonderful. Simply beautiful. Creating a persuasive masked thing is another thing to create visually appealing elements and Ice Ice is considered wonderful considering its elegant image. Blue Sky Studios is a company looking for them in the future.
