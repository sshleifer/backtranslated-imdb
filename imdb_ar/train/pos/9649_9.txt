It was screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival "Come Come Back", 25, 26 and 27 April 2001. Cinematographer uses technologies that add to storytelling. Even with autumn / winter backgrounds for the "present" and the summer spring for "memories of the past" trips, there may be some difficulty after continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether any of the leaders are gay, actors depict the emerging relationship in terms of real life; from physical violence to each other to their emotional love. The story takes you slowly to the characters at first. But as the end approaches, you really care where these guys will be next summer! You too, will want to know more.
