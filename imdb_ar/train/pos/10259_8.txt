Many people have not gone to this series, but many Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining. Devil's experience in particular has some really impressive effects - not only the infamous eyeball scene, but also a very realistic leather slide on foot and a heavy hammer break - are very realistic - especially for the old low-budget video. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know: This film is a "torture" and a fake "extremist" tattoo appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. It's a conspiracy as it is simple: a little girl is detained by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to find out where the breaking point is located. This requires brutal violence - all effective factual effects including the effects mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as painful application of hot oils on the girl's captive arm and placement of the larvae in the subsequent volatile wound. <br /> <br /> Less effective sequences are at the beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men alternate as they clap the hell out of the girl while dropping her head and the second sequence where the three men rotate and kick the girl and push her to the ground. It is clear that these two presentations are presented and diminish the realism of the rest of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the role of victim of "experience" is completely convinced that she is suffering from pain and takes a great deal of abuse and raw stuff on the camera. Her reactions are because her headphones are tied to her head and the loud noises that have been running for hours in a row are frightening. Some other abuses you experience are exposed to a tree network during the only times you get a rest. There is also a disturbing scene where the persecuted kidnappers pass through the courage in her face and another disgusting scene where she was spun on a desk chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she dangles. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this series, I hope you have helped me determine whether you want to give this episode an opportunity or not. 8.5 / 10 to experience Satan.
