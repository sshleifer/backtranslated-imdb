Look, if you're interested in Nancy Drew's book, what I'm going to do is pick up a book and read it. I'm not. Since then I can remember that I read people who were making films because they were not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in book form. When the Lord came out, people complained. When he won the third Oscar - "The book was better". When I saw the emulator killing, "the book was better". Now a group of people are upset, again, because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win an Oscar - if anything will be one of the Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice awards. I say give the movie a break. It's a film and not a paper. As a film, she found Nancy Drew very enjoyable - featuring violent films from Bruce Willis and Adam Hammerberg and supporting roles Tit Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on O.C) and Rachel's Lee That. This is the first time I have seen Emma Roberts in a film, and frankly enjoy her work more than Julia and Eric. Her character remains constant throughout the film and interacts well with the conflict. A beautiful movie of the spirit of Harriet the Spy is beautiful every now and then. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars because I totally enjoyed the film and I love watching it again, and maybe buy it on a DVD release.
