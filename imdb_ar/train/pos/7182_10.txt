I thought that for the first episode of the first series, it worked well. It was really fun and I thought the actors were fantastic. I think it is a crime to say that this is bad because it seemed timely. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically true because it was supposed to be a Saturday entertainment and not a boring historical film, so I think the costumes and settings were correct. Great start and I love what will come after that !! I talked to many people in my school and they love the show! We all think it's great entertainment and has great stories to enjoy.
