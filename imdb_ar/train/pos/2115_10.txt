After seeing You Got Mail and I was disappointed, I decided to watch the original movie that inspired this film, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed at this film. It is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies at all times. The acting is very perfect, and the story is very beautiful. If you do not see it, I would like to urge you to see it today. I'm not against re-making and sometimes I love the new version more than the original version, but this time I must admit that your Got Mail is poorly adapted with this classic. Do not miss it, go to your video store and rent a shop The Around The Corner today!
