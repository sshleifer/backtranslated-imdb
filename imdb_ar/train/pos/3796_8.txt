Jim McKay made one of the best movies you'll see throughout the year. The quiet simplicity of this film attracts you from the very beginning and never lets go. There is not one wrong note in the entire film. One thing does not work. Hand-held camera does not distract you and never should be. The three young women who follow their lives are always real. There is no single rhythm where the audience is reminded that we are looking for acting actors. Just real girls trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is the cinema in its finest form, and although it will only be seen by a handful of filmgoers, it deserves a much wider version. Special hats to Hugh Hefner to provide filmmakers with the funds to give this important film. I can not wait to see what Mr. MacKay is doing next.
