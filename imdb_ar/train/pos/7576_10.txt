The third and last part of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most realistic all. The "training" is completed even during the first five minutes of the film. Not for Everyone, This film details details of Hanso's investigation into loan settlement by order of blind monks. It also provides a historical commentary on the proud rejection of ancient Japan to integrate Western technology. "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" was just a funny and enjoyable journey with little to do with its plan, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" managed to deliver everything and bring it home in the end. Definitely the perfect ending. Oh yeah, Hanzo still exercises a lot of sex, there is too much blood and violence unnecessarily (he is * Hanso code after all).
