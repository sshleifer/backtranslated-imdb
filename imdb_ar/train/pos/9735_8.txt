Romance comedy is not the right way to describe "how to lose friends and alienate people". The basic romance in this plot is broken, for the most part, by the most interesting "Rape to Riches" story. Although the main line of the story has been somewhat rushed, however, in many of the screen shots; get rid of the "fine details", focusing on those key relationships that make the Office Policy and use those irrelevant scenes Almost, which only used for comic effect. However, it works fine, especially with the Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately extremely intelligent and plays well on the transatlantic relationship shared by Pegg with his fellow stars and integrates the cross between the high and low life society very well and very refreshingly in the story that despite the predictability, it is a unique journey . The characters in the film are well presented, and acting is certainly an extra point in the film. The "trade places" relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst works well in an attractive story, because they need a better word. Even Fox, whose core wealth is of course sexual attraction, is shocked by what turns out to be a largely dark character and acts well. It is one of those films in which all the little details salute the wonderful work. From sexually transsexual strippers to stunning soundtracks, everything fits in well with what can only be described as a smart comedy.
