This may be very fun at the theater in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure angle of the taste of my film which really appreciated the horrible films that were well executed. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" may have been moved at times because people usually have strong feelings about dental issues. The Anti-Dumping Association may have launched a campaign against her, telling dentists about their apologies for the film and about the "Marathon Man" (which contains only one similar scene in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was filmed in 21 days. Of course, later publishing can take longer than filming at times and editing for The Dentist is ideal for images. Quick shortcuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist takes care of his wife, there are only two quick pieces showing what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imagination! Corbin Pearson was a good choice for this role because he has a lot of experience playing "psychologically" characters and has sold the completely mandatory aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the speed of the film was right for me. Directors reveal the wife's dysfunction in the right way. All the people in the dental office seem to be real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension as they deal with people who are impatient waiting for the arrival of the dentist. At the same time, the dentist is on the verge of a huge mental collapse! Unlike many movies of this type, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the trap of the dentist in very calculated ways. There are even two types of law enforcement involved in a small sub-plot that end up shocking the confrontation near the end. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for the faint of heart or for dental phobia but for a true roller coaster ride is highly recommended for lovers of intelligent gorefests.
