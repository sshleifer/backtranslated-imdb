What a wonderful movie, so good that it made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The film really starts with a bad monster eating a few people and a party that draws the first two people to each other. <br /> <br /> Binden Hughes plays the role of an eccentric Vlad, a kind of malice out there for the person who moved to the city and used the services of a certain real estate agent to find a house for him. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, and we know coordination. <br /> <br /> The movie is viewable, but the actors' performances are very impressive and it seems as though they do not want to be in this film, but this may just be part of the decaying atmosphere. <br /> <br /> You do not like the end, but there is a complement, it must be tracked. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not fit the part. Later, I could not stop thinking about it, it exudes a strange passion, so maybe it was right for the part. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES was last seen in the movie "Hitler - Rise of Evil" as Lieutenant Goffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
