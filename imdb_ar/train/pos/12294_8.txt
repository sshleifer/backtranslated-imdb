I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was connected to the studio, and that people and people's traffic was so smooth and neat that it was not photographed on site. But no problem - it's still a wonderful combination of Marcel Carney. It seems that the plot is somewhat erratic at times, as if they were spending it as they progress, but because it is unpredictable, it draws attention to the bitter end. The clips of money when the lovers alone in their room are burdened with some fairly arranged dialogue, but it is nice to accept to fall into any strange. Are these young men symbols of cancerous despair in pre-war France or just stupid? Suicide agreements are fairly common. If suicides are young and healthy in their lives before they are trampled on, do you think anything other than fools are misleading? <br /> <br /> Arlette played the role of a good bitch - she kept that zipper her clothes busy all the time! I've seen just a few movies with Jouvet - it's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A wonderful film in the atmosphere, well shot and photographed with a lot happening, it needs a few views to make it all in place. Anabella and Omont made an exceptionally beautiful couple. In his second film, Heurtebise Perier played a small, armed role as a gay man. All in all: great.
