This film was more than just a masculine stage for a man like me, and how he should deal with everyone. His mother suffers from depression, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister is fairly acceptable. Looks good relationship with his friend / director and leaves his family to experience life with this first man. Unfortunately, the new man is around him and says he really does not mean anything. A young gay guy goes to the end and ends up in a chromatic box and finally leaves, and gets rid of his new sweetheart and starts over. We left with him to start and watch, do not share, happily. So maybe things are going better for him in the future. It was the end of a kind, but the whole movie was quite realistic, so I'll let this real end outperform a high rating.
