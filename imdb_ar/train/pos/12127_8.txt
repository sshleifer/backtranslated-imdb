The story is fairly simplistic, but with the sudden repercussions of the main wealth of the characters, but Leslie Howard and Pitt Davis's images of Philip Carey, the obsessive obsessive lover and Mildred Rogers, the unworthy object, raised the film largely above standard Melodrama. <br /> <br /> Philip is sensitive, educated, most of whom were in bondage to disintegrate him first and then his compassion for Mildred is no different from the character Howard used to play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, a very refined and dignified Southern man to make it into an era Raw reconstruction. In fact it seems that Philip has surrendered to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picture? He does not even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he will not make it as a painter. Perhaps it was this negativity, these low expectations that drove him to stand up with the selfish waitress Cockney all the time he worked. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is not forgotten, the notion of "human bondage" today is essentially a Bette Davis image, perhaps because of the well-known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to get a part of Mildred, Also because film audiences tend to prefer characters using their superior power. Mildred may have a grating voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel, making it somewhat understandable why Philip allowed himself to be jailed for as long as he did. Although the man who eats Mildred may at times seem monotonous, it often evokes compassion in the viewer as if she were ill and realizes late that Philip is the only decent man he has ever cared about. One might think it is something when Phillip is accused of condoning it because it is "not good" enough. (It seems that the scene in which Philip and Norah reject romance magazines as garbage for kitchen maids confirms this). <br /> <br /> Most supporting characters are also effective, especially Norah, a reasonable romance writer who loves Philip but knows it can not compete at all with Mildred and Sally, who both have the beauty of Mildred and Nora's fitness. The only character I found hollow was Sally's eccentric father, an aristocratic father who looked like a stock figure from an earlier era. <br /> <br /> Classic deserves his reputation.
