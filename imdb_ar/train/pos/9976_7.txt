Sure, it was cheesy and illogical and sometimes tacky, but at least the filmmakers did not try it. While most television films fall on the brink of mediocrity, this film already has some distinguishing features. Filmography was good for a television film, and Viggo Mortensen presents Aragorn's shades in a film about a man playing according to his rules. Most of the flashback chains were of a kind of cheese, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was disturbed by the role of Jason Priestley in the film as a rebel shock, but again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was awful. However, it was good to see Tucson, Arizona featured in the film.
