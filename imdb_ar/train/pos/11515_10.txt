It has been many years since I saw it, but I feel compelled to defend these precious stones against those who criticize them. <br /> <br /> It is fun and unusual to note the diversity of views here. This is what humor I suppose. It's subjective. It's either shipped through your ridiculous skull at 60,000 volts or leaving you cold and wondering why you were given time. <br /> <br /> This show contains some of Britain's best comedians who have been assembled in a silly and uninhibited story and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and the visual comedy are beautifully presented and the two leaders (Clez and Lowe) are wonderful together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I can not really say anything other than asking you to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed, and in a world free of great humor, this is a classic transient and harmless piece of comic intelligence.
