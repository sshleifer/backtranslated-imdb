I love this movie and have seen it many times over the years. It improves with every watch. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is as hard and realistic as life in the wilderness in those days. I found myself commenting while watching him. Someone here said Rip Torn was miscast. I could not have been more different. He is as skillful as the cruel role of Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave / backbone. Conchatta Farrell is as great as Elinor the widow, whom Clyde assigns as a housekeeper / chef (with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Scala is excellent as a distant neighbor called Grandma. Also star is the glamorous Montana Prairie. It is a beautiful and brutal country where it settles. There are some scenes that are disgusting and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! They even have a wonderfully superb musical score and great text. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It's worth every 10s that gets here.
