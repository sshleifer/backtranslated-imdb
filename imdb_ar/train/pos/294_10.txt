Monetary and Financial Volatility At the first edition, critics turned and stated that this film was the director's best director. La Ronde, who likes the movie, is developing rapidly as the men of the detective agency Ben Jazara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak continue to fall in love with some of the most unusual and beautiful women in the film (Audrey Hepburn), Colin Camp, Dorothy Straten and Patti Hansen. Much of the script was written or rewritten on the day of filming, which gives the film a great sense. Ben Jazara is excellent. The main detective follows Audrey Hepburn after dropping the singer Colin Camp and seeing taxi driver Patty Hansen on his side. John Ritter follows Dorothy Straten unintentionally and falls in love with her immediately. Blaine Novak has a few girls chasing him (including Joyce Hisser and Elizabeth Pena). This film contains some great presentations by senior actors. The most prominent positions are Audrey Hepburn (does not have a line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara was never the best (and an inspirational choice to lead a romantic), and Colleen Camp played one of her best roles as the country-obsessed country singer Christie Miller. She is delighted to watch as she shoots off her lines at the Rat Mice delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
