Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's list was excellent. Wonderful hour for children and adults of all races. Large noses can be seen as a hint towards phallic symbols, in the same way as H.R. Puff N Stuff for smoking marijuana. Your kids will love this movie. I enjoyed it a lot as a child. My father showed me this film as a child. He also enjoyed it and pointed out that the exaggerated nose was a dark symbol. Although at that time I had no idea what it was. The movie is comedy and adventure. The story of a fool and joy. You and I should enjoy this together.
