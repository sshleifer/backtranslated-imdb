The most satisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is logical and realistic. The choice of Oscar-winning Juliette Pinocch as an interest in Dan Dan was a wonderful decision; it was exceptionally talented, smart and naturally attractive, and thankfully, the right age for the part! Had this film been produced with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is an ideal film for adults interested in mature comedy that excludes the three elements of the "Freakback" formula: stupid chicks, chauvinists, and dreary jokes. "Dan in real life" is intelligent and has fun, laughing smart all the time. While other comedies integrate or rely almost entirely on jokes that infect the audience with laughter, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are naturally more intelligent and include some reflection on the part of the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious middle daughter played in a very outrageous way by actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to determine whether this is a personal choice of its own or a choice for the director. In either case, her character is unrealistic and distressing. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away the whole story. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a wonderful film, and a wonderful escape from the repetition of offensive comedy and dumb down. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) excellent cinema. It is simply a beautiful and light comedy.
