In the years of their youth, Mel Turmi and Victor Borge make this movie fun - especially watching a young Sinatra, on the sunny side of the 30th, and certainly conveys that it was "Yes, I am a popular singer, but barely a representative after" the stage. Michelle Morgan is an annoying and unfamiliar presence, and Jack Haley's actor was completely lost attractiveness. Leon Errol is silly, as always, but in general very funny. 7 stars of 10 potential spin around the "appreciation" correct, because with a combination of its positive aspects, coupled with the lack of a lot of story, a silly story in it, the above harassment - it's generally average at best. Most of the magic is from watching the three recreational icons in their early years.
