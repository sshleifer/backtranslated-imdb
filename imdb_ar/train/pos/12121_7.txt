Somerset Mugam's characters are brought to life in the movie RKO "Human Bondage". But the film is a highly structural version of the novel, with the performance of Petit Davis making stars absorbing all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); dreams of becoming a painter, but is said to have no talent in the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard struggles instead to become a doctor. His efforts seem to point to some bad advice about the arts; despite his success in medicine, his drawings seemed easier - he also noted the symbolism of his handicap, "club feet" (shown in the film). <br /> <br /> Along the way (immediately, in this version), Howard became fascinated by waitress Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's description of "Mildred" is unusual, and has culminated in an astounding speech, when I told Howard, among other things, that she had to "wipe my mouth!" After kissing him. Howard's performance is also good, but the story fails to explain his long fascination with Davies. Therefore, their performance is lost. <br /> <br /> Still, a movie to watch acting, including some good supporting players. The character of the House of Davis was famously inspired by the "Writing" campaign of the Best Actress Award of 1934. For the record, the third was put. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "One night happened" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "Wimbol Street Clamps" <br /> <br /> 3. Beth Davis - "The Bondage of Man" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* From the bondage of man (6/28/34) ) John Cromwell - Leslie Howard, Beth Davis, Reginald Denny
