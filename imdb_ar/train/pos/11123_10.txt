Greetings from this Portuguese man :) <br /> <br /> I think the soprano is one of the best productions ever, it mixes reality with imagination in such a way, it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits the paper as a glove! I love that the sopranos will never end. she's perfect! I have seen a soprano when I was a kid, but I was so young that I do not stay awake till the episode ends, so I now bought all the episodes in DVD format and watched all the episodes at home before and after dinner and I was addicted, Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best soap operas ever made for television. Both argument are fantastic and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on this work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my English. Thanks for reading.
