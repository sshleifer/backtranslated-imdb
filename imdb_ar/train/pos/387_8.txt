This movie is good it's not the best CG CG fung flicks but good. First thing first, the story is already good. The whole idea of ​​the gods versus the fallen kind of gods deals with great super powers. My problem there are so many characters! I got very confusing when they turned scenes! The special effects were incredible! The scenes of fighting were very fast and complex. This film practically all computer generated. The acting is wonderful, as always expected from the leading players. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist and the only character. Zhang Zai did nothing in this film. I thought she would have a bigger role but she saw one fight and a lot of tones. The bad guy, the whole skull army and everything the blood cloud is very scary. Music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just one film. Theres a story of a lot of cramming in 2 hours. Maybe if there's a book or something, I'll be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the safety of the story for action. I highly recommend Storm Riders more than this on any day.
