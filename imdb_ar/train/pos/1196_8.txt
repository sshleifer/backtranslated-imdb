I had watched several days filming a movie of this film that summer, and the final result was only two scenes in the film. The Sylvan Lake site was in Black Hills. Bring the cart, stop the cart, etc. So young Dakota looked forward to watching the film and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was executed so the shooting scenes were real. (Yes Doris, the animals were injured during filming) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? Great Western / social comment from the 1950s. This must be in the same category as High Noon for Real Western Drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel without A Cause was at the age of fifty.
