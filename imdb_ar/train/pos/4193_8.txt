Director Sam Fuller enjoys a variety of denominations, especially in Europe. But the bulk of his films are more than forgetting. However, he directed a truly wonderful film in Pickup on South Street. The films that followed were produced very early in his career and were much inferior. <br /> <br /> From first to last, "capture" works at all levels. It was filmed flawlessly and boasts great shows all the time. Richard Widmark and Telema Ritter, who have a great number of best performances, have reached their peak. Widmark, who was not strange in playing villains, while really mean in essence, was still able to reveal the humane inferiority that makes his character fascinating as well as making the fall of his personality Jean Peters more credible. <br /> Fuller holds no punches in this really tough movie. There is a scene where Jean Peters flips by Widmark. It's really shocking in reality. This is not a case of photography that is carefully designed. <br /> <br /> Less aware of yourself than many Nuer in a period where this remains a great example of the genre.
