I first saw Frailty on Yahoo Movies video on the way back the day, after hearing Stephen King praise him to the high heaven. I do not like any of the stars, I still want to see him because I'm very impressed with the excitement. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The acting was wonderful, especially from the young boys. I usually hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton did a good job directing him too. They have been beautifully photographed. <br /> <br /> One must also notice the intrigues of the plot. The three swings finally hit hard and fast, and I did not see it coming. The recent development of the film, along with the seriousness of what has just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, although I have been seen many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
