This is a great story from Disney: it's the story of a high school seniors coach (Dennis Quid), who was on his way to major tournaments in the role of the pitcher, but suffered a career injury. But through a series of events, Jimmy gets Morris (Quaid) on an experience with a major league team, but he makes the list. This is a wonderful family film. It's inspiring, but it does not catch him much. It's fun and fun. Adults will enjoy this film as well as children. It depends on a real story, although I'm sure filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story. The sexy leader as a character title, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie for the whole family can enjoy, do not look further
