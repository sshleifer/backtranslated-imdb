This film features one of Richard Dreyfus' greatest performances, as an actor who plays the dictator and does so convincingly that his mother does not discover the crook. Also, this movie is funny, but has a serious aspect as well. What is especially intriguing about this film is Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader has greatly added to the story's quality and entertainment value in the film. The main character, who at the beginning of the film is an actress struggling and fairly calm, also develops and ends with respect for the film. I liked this movie
