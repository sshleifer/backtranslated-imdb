In Anne of Green Gables (1934), Maryla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (Phoenix Hagee), middle-aged siblings who live together in Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decided to adopt the boy From a distant orphanage to help with their farm. But the orphan who was sent to them is an early 14-year-old girl named Dawn Evelyn Paris - an expert on the Disney series Alice, which would later be named after her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 years old in the story of Lucy Maude Montgomery, but the actress herself could not reliably move from 11 to college during the story. The film suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are funnier than an eleven-year-old. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but unhappy with her name, structure, freckles, and long red hair. Being a child of fantasy, Anne is delighted with the joy of life and adapts quickly to her new family and environment in Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is "the original drama queen of drama" and the screenwriter has chosen to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed this basic type of family drama into amusing comedy. The change that delighted the masses and continues to frustrate the fundamentalists reader. <br /> <br /> Since comedy is very much in line with the spirit of Montgomery, I can not see any reason to deal with the changes, but let this be a fair warning to anyone who expects a perfectly sincere adaptation. The comedy element is the power of the film because it is one of the oldest parodies of reflections at Hollywood conferences. Ann Shirley was one of the most beautiful Hollywood movies ever, and the film is in black and white. Much of the entertainment lies in seeing the endless personal verses of the title about her appearance and the color of her hair contrasts with what appears on the screen. She regularly tells her rural owners, who have no nonsense, with melodramatic lines such as: "If you refuse, it will be a lifelong sadness." Perhaps the most extreme moment is when it corrects its spelling on the classroom whiteboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is doing a great job, as Gilbert Blythe and Sara Hadin enchant Ann's interest in all the scenes in which she shows up as a dazzling neighbor of the Kuthbert. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
