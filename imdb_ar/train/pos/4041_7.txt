Tinshu was jailed and sentenced to death. When escaping electrocution, government officials give him an option to either be more shocked or agree to some tests. He chose the experiment and put it in a large metal cell with a bad asshole who survived the electric shock. They can have anything they want in the room (within reason), but they can not leave. After a few days, meals are reduced to one meal a day and set to more than 100 room temperature. After more warnings are issued at intervals so they can not sleep. One day, a "witch" comes to her cell (though part is surrounded by glass). What will happen next, will let you know that. I may be in the minority here but I loved it. It was interesting to me. Now if the half-yield is as good as the increase, you'll appreciate this on it much higher. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C + <br /> <br /> Media Kit DVD 2 Additions: Disc 1) Cut the director; Versus, Aragami, Attack the Gas Station, Deadly Outlaw Rekka "Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Comment with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhi Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takundum Tsutomu Takahashi; cast and crew interview.
