Trude Lintz (Renee Rosso) was a very lucky lady for several years. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had a lot of extracurricular money. She was passionate about animals and devoted herself to providing refuge to the peasants on her property. Trudy also introduced a chimpanzee in her home to be more like children. They were dressed and had many amenities. One day, you learn a small abandoned gorilla. She knows nothing about the big monkeys, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the life of the gorillas. Once out of danger, Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla, too, as one of her children. This works fine for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is really a smart addition to her home. But, friends is also a gorilla and its strength and curiosity become tremendously enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep friends under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a movie you should watch. Based on a true story, Trudy and her monkey develop a unique relationship in the history and traditions of animals. Of course, friends are not a real gorilla but a mechanical gorilla in the film, but it is too close to seem quite real. Rousseau performed well as a lady before her time, and the supporting players are also very nice. Fashion is perfect, as it fits the old era of story, settings and outstanding production values. But more importantly, the animals here are plentiful, not only friends, but adorable chimps, ducks, rabbits, and so forth. For those who want to watch a movie and take them to an animal paradise, here on earth, this is a fantastic choice for the film. All animal lovers, even those who just want to watch a wonderful family movie, will go to "friends".
