When it comes to movies, I can be picky, and I'll complain about anything and everything that went wrong. While each film has its drawbacks, The Night Listener has an exceptionally low number. <br /> <br /> If you have read the last review (it was difficult, half of which was written in caps and did not include actual information about the film), you may have thought this movie was not good. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you discover the reason for the disdain for the poster: he / she does not like the fact that the director is like me (or the production team is smoking the crack ... apparently). <br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that I have not written any reviews before, I think this film deserves a film based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's go on a quick checklist first: 1. A big plot? at all. I will not give it up, but the plot is very strong and certainly not what one expects based on commercials. This is a thrilling film and not a horror, and it must be treated as such. The story will really surprise you, and most importantly because it is real (and the plot remains quite faithful to actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Acting gorgeous? Yes sure. Robin Williams has long since been released from a series of comedy films, and has since flourished in serious roles that many people had driven him out of a decade ago. He again played a prominent role in The Night Listener, where he played the role of a radio host who becomes increasingly anxious and confused in case ... well, I will let you see yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I mentioned, I actually know something about the direction. I have been sutdying the art of directing at school now for 3 years. Of course I do not really think that makes a difference (the only thing that matters is whether you like the direction), but I thought I should simply prove again that I am making my views here on something intrinsic and relevant ... for example: Of the director (or alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and gloomy, allowing angles and lighting to help create desirable emotions such as "tension and release" rather than the chaotic and rapid work of the camera and the rapid reductions we often experience today. Some people can show you a story through their camera, while others feel as if they should make the story with the camera. I really appreciate it when someone has these courageous days to use the camera as it should be used, which is a bit of a thing we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, Cinema, and Editing? Great everywhere. I have already written a lot, and I can continue with these last three things for ten more paragraphs, so I will conclude. <br /> <br /> In short, go to watch this movie. Do not listen to people who have external motives for waste disposal, especially if they are so stupid that they reveal that drive 1/4 on the road through their publications. Enjoy the show! -Ben
