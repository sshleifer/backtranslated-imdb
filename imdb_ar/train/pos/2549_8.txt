Ronald Coleman's awesome urbane is presented here as in a few of his other films. It is literally in every scene, and this comedy is still new because of it, not despite it. He is handsome, intelligent and very intelligent here because he is still a step forward from his beautiful wandering wife - ideally played by me. The film is based on a French play and combines the best qualities in that farce. Most of the support team is well known, at least by the face if not the name ... It is perfectly perfect for this funny film. The wonderful Mr. Coleman is a mix of Sean Connery and Clark Gable because he takes a step forward from other characters. His many talents can be appreciated in the classic "lost horizon" that every movie must see.
