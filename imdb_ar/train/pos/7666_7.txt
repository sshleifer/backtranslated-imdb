Two warriors fight in the fourth dimension, one of them (Brian Thompson as a cabal) trying to destroy the Earth, and the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Meridor) is trying to save her. The plot is very silly and the gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill give one look. Valuable: 7 out of 10.
