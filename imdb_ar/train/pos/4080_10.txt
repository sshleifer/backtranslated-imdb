This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. Moreover, all serious competitors for this title came from the same creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki and his studio Jibli. Specifically, other great films include "Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki Delivery Service". Spirited Away is very good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adults. The only thing that distinguishes "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is more than an adventure trip full of tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? It's a complete package: the animation has been done very well, and the story is really attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese animations are creative, but they are dark, sarcastic or violent; the animation itself is often jerky, stylish and appropriate. None of these problems plague the castle in the sky. He has a burning imagination, well painted characters, if there are a few exaggerated copies of real people. (There is none of those who wear trenchcoats) there are a lot of adventures, but there is no blood and jar. The animation is smooth, detailed and cinematic - not too many flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The sound that acts in the English dubbed version is first class, especially the leaders, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also great. Use your studio sound, if you've got it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I especially enjoyed is that much of the background story has not been explained. He once lived in Labota and is now abandoned. why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we only have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the world that has been invented has been fully realized. In fact, it is fair to say that the world is becoming more fully aware of most of the secondary characters, who are mostly considered one-dimensional stock personalities (eg gruff general, sidekick silly, miner old kooky, etc.) Ages 6 to 60 years!
