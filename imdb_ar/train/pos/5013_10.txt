Barbra sings the standards from room to room, filled with musicians, including a clip where she was a little girl again , All ending with a wonderful copy of her distinctive song, (at that time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour in Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra's songs sing for poverty ... it is better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III .... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, such as ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and "Girl Girl" varied .... <br /> <br /> All in all, part A great history of television, made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
