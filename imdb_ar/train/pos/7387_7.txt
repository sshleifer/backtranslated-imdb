The events of September 11, 2001 cast a shadow over the Oscars with silence for one minute before the memorial montage and there was little singing in all the dancing comedies we expected from this award show, but this was by no means the case It's a bad thing. Entertainment was somewhat curtailed with LOTR sent with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. I have to admit that this was actually more fun than the exaggerated song and dance numbers we have seen over the years, and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad advance in contrast to the mystical David Letterman of a few years and one minute silence for the victims 11/9 It was painful and generous <br /> <br /> As for the awards, New Zealand was completely stolen. "The Fellowship of the Ring" returned to the house with four minor awards, while Jamil El Gamal was unbearably awarded to most of the grand prizes, with the exception of the best actor who should have gone to a strong man from New Zealand but went to a nice guy of American origin instead. The only Oscar Awards approved by them apart from the prizes presented to FELLOWSHIP were the awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor, both of which are valid calls.
