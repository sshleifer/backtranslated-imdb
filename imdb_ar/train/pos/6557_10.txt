I am a 53-year-old university professor. I went with my wife and my 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, intelligent, fast-paced and very charming. The plot was easy enough to be followed by a 10-year-old boy, but twisted enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the team was fine. My only criticism is that Los Angeles groups were not as interesting as they should be. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costumes, lighting, cinematography, editing and output were excellent. All in all, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (all of whom are adult males) have brutally attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that depict young women as strong, intelligent and independent. Their writings reveal their sexual nature more than anything about this wonderful family film. I highly recommend it to every child and every parent.
