Do not expect to photograph "truth". However, the calculations of these veterans in the Iraq and Afghanistan war require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main force of the film is that it clearly depicts the words and wounds of these veterinarians and post-war conflicts to rebuild some of the normal life and functioning of their lives. <br /> <br /> My main critique of the film is twofold: it unilaterally defends anti-war activity but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the Army and Veterans Affairs programs to help those who "have suffered and are still suffering from war shocks These are not fatal flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> As an ancient warrior, I know that the horrific consequences of the war are real, and that these young men and women express them very well.This veterinarian clearly describes the physical and mental pain and suffering of most Veterans and ordinary people need to be understood because the horrors of all wars are painful And very troublesome.
