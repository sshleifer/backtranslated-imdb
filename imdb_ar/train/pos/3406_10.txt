In terms of visual beauty this movie is awesome! I had no idea that Technicolor came out too early. Although I did not like the end, the whole movie is wonderful and makes me wish I were in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is very seductive and I have loved her in this way. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not get the landscapes and collections ... the hotel, palm trees, desert, everything there ... The Legion also brings a sense of "Beau Geste" to the film. Definitely do not make such films anymore. Do not fail to watch this classic!
