Halloween John Carpenter <br /> <br /> Is it the greatest horror movie ever? No .. maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and will remain so. The film is very ingenious and will always carry a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not get to see this movie until twenty years after it was released, but after twenty years on the appearance of many cats slanted copy of the film and the film still gives the same effect should have done after that. My dad suggested before I go to Halloween H20 that I was renting 1 and 2 Halloween and renting it for the whole story, and after watching Halloween it was quite clear that he had set and adjusted the Slasher type. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. He was jailed for 15 years and was treated by Dr Sam Lomis, who fled to his home town of Haddonfield where he began pursuing three young girls: Laurie Stroud, an innocent writing worm, Annie Brackett, a sarcastic who speaks with difficulty, Linda van der Klock and a sexually powerful girl. Dr. Lomis Michael follows here with the help of Sheriff Lee Brackett, who still suspects his story of the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins to kill them one by one, until Laurie leaves the innocent, who are the main target on Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The film was great and all the actors and the actress presented high-profile performances, and Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing in her first film role as Laurie Stroud and Donald Blizzance performed brilliantly with his little role as Lomis. Nick Castle, who filmed Michael, did a great job as a soulless and evil killer, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of this film is that it was a shocking result by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most famous horror themes known today. Blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when the young Lori cries on the wall after seeing her deceased friends, and in the shadow behind her face Michael checks out before hitting. Michael's mask was one of the most sent chills in the spine ever, and the white emotional face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderful is not a great film unlike Friday's The Cheesy 13 films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and instead works on suspense and tension. <br /> <br /> It became very clear that Halloween produced films such as Friday 13th and characters such as Jason Voorhees, who was just a freak for Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I suggest that you watch this movie at least once in your life because it is a milestone in filmmaking and is undoubtedly the greatest horror film of all time.
