This film was adorable. Real film feeling good when you need one. The story is light (this is not "Gone with the Wind") but sometimes, one needs this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, wonderful and wonderful fashion / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is wonderful in this role. Is definitely a new bright star for Hollywood. Everyone should watch them and it will be great in the future. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of this film was also impressive. A nice mix of modern and Indian melodies. I was dancing in most of the film. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend if the movie is fun is what you need.
