Everything I remember was excellent ... it was great with Sam Waterstone and George Inez (before he became more familiar with the American fans) .... Excellent texts like only English can be done - Edward Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsie / Albert Secrets Type Campion, but with the evolution of Jules Verne. A kind of MacGyver would have happened in England 80 years ago ... at the beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I was often wondering if the creators at MacGyver saw these performances. MacGyver was first broadcast after about 3 years. <br /> <br /> I still have one loop on a very deteriorated bar.
