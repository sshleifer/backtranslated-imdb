If the Australian Post Office ever needs a promotional film for employment, that's it. This is a film whose heart is in the right place and you can watch it over and over again. Miranda's performance is touching because it shows a part of Australia that many Europeans can not imagine, where it can be cool, wet and grim, just like anywhere else, and as important as anywhere else, the people around you. The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the possibility of a career moving to a "dead post office" an idea to consider. Miranda continued to produce bigger films, but I hope you always keep thinking about this film?
