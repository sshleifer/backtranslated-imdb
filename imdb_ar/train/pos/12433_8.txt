It's a good movie, although people who are not familiar with the cartoons and books at Modesty Blaise may find them a bit slow and lacking in motion. For Modesty fans, the movie will be very enjoyable, especially since it is very faithful in its introduction to the "Modesty Blaise". Peter O'Donnell has been listed as an "creative consultant" and filmmakers must have taken an interest in him because the plot follows closely the details that have been presented in comic books over the years (though the events have been reworked into modern times) . The only thing the real fan might find disappointing is that there is no Willy Garvin in the story. This deficiency in Willie is again just a fulfillment of the sequence of Modesty Blaise since the film began in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very humble young man of modesty that actually seems much like the humility that is supposed to appear to him. A welcome change from the misrepresentation of Monica Vitti's image of modesty.
