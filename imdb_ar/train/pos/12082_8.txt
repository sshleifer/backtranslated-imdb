After seeing this film accurately on the strength of reviewers' ratings, I was very surprised. Although the budget is clearly low, it bears signs of smart ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up at the strange house and looks out of the window, I find myself thinking that her sense of isolation will be enhanced by an outward focus on her face and then moving back to the house and its isolated location. And here! The next scene was the last shot of the house standing alone on the cliff at the edge of the water. There are other examples of how the smart director managed to raise his movie to the level of excitement is very fun. Surely savvy viewers will see them, but you should rest assured that they will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> As for the shows, George MacDride is the same as usual in his crawling, barely keeping his coolness while suggesting the potential for unintentional violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a stale working girl who did not want to succumb without a fight. But Mrs. May Witty, boy, so she pushed me into doubt in my eyes, and I thought she could get away from her evil schemes. <br /> <br /> This real diamond is in rough and should not be missed.
