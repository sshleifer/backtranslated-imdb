I was not sure when I heard about this checkout. I was thinking how stupid Disney gets. I was wrong. I found to be very good. I mean it is not the Lion King but it is wonderful to see another side of a certain point. It was very funny. Nor was it one of Disney's favorite Disney-animated sequences, resembling the cartoon The Lion King. The only thing that raised Hafizi is the whole theater film during the film. Do not give anything but you have to know what I'm talking about. I also enjoyed it was fantastic to have most of the cast of origin to return. It was a very good film.
