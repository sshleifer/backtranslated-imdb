On the night of the bachelorette, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets with the brilliant dancer Becky (Julia Stills) at the bar, drinking a lot together and the next morning wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law tells him that his fianc√©e Karen (Salma Blair) may arrive at his apartment and strongly asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Soon, he found that she had cancer, and then, during the preparations for his wedding dinner, he realized that Becky was Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious positions. The first attraction of this film is definitely the main trio of actresses and actresses. Julia Steeles and Selma Blair, the two excellent and wonderful performers, and Jason Lee, surprisingly funny, are doing well. I laughed a lot along the story, but there are some really fun scenes. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when his imagination finds his imagination in many cases; in a pharmacy, try to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most scenes his neighbor minister. When Karen calls the store; or when the police find a suspect in the assault on Paul. I've been able to digitize many other scenes, but it's better to rent a reader or buy this movie and enjoy it a lot. Seven voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
