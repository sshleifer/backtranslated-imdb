If "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist films), this pre-World War I film is Grandpa. The distinguished student, who starves in empty clothes, makes a deal with Satan - Satan gives him a bag of gold without a bottom, in return for "anything in this room." Satan chooses the student's reflection in the mirror. He walks with a doppelganger student, who commits crimes that are blamed on the student. <br /> <br /> The movie is marred by some limitations arising from the primitive state of filmmaking in 1913; the plot screams for the effects of chiaroschuro, but the film is, necessarily, every shot in broad daylight. But the scene in which reflection is reflected from the mirror is still surrounded by intensity. <br /> <br /> More interesting for trends that amaze her than her interest, the Prague student is still worth the effort.
