I was attracted to this film the moment I saw her preview on Oscar Night. When I read about Kay Pollack, I was hooked. We Americans are suckers for the return of a child. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a huge draw in Sweden. As a very American, I can only speculate on why. Perhaps the reason for Lena's provocative humor at the beginning of the film and other social commentary, but perhaps because of the central message that I think has the same appeal everywhere in rich societies. <br /> <br /> This movie's message to me is the same as Titanic. Life is short, and as far as anyone really knows everything we have. Can be taken away at any time. Is it regrettable that we spend so much time hiding behind walls that separate us from others because we are so afraid of harm? The demolition of the walls is painful but the feeling of vitality is on the other side of those miserable walls. Feeling of life is worth the risk. Give and you will receive. So start living now. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for lack of characterization and other flaws. I say that all of you are sophisticated and false. Getting the grip of people, a tale, is a tale because we wealthy Westerners are physically wealthy but their souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a band or band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you. Spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you go out and communicate with your fellow men. Writing a check is not enough. We are social by the way. Even the humility of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought of. <br /> <br /> A rugged individual has a reputation for being overvalued.
