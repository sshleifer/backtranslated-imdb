If this movie were produced a few years later, I would have given it a lower grade. However, for 1909, this film was small and still stands well today. Do not try to compare this silent film with the subsequent silence - the industry has changed so radically that short films in the first decade of the 20th century do not resemble all the films produced in the 1920s and beyond. <br /> <br /> The length of this film is 11 minutes (almost for most of the films at the time), and it is a contrast in the story of Edgar Allan Bo, The Cascade of Amontelado. While many are familiar with the story, I will not elaborate on it because I do not want to destroy the film. Just enough to say it is very creepy !!
