Every person we meet affects our thinking, modifies our ways, little of this person rubs us. "Eighth Day" deals with this theme (compare "rain maker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Otwell), a business psychologist, meets George (Pascal Duquin), a Down syndrome child. The winning performances from both actors present this film as its main force. The opening sequence is excellent as George connects his theory of creating the world and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that frustrates Harry severely. For example, George who is completely uninhabited demands a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It is the kind of scene where your tears laugh. I loved the scene where the Down syndrome group fled on a trip to the art gallery on a bus and crashed into the Paradise amusement park. The hilarious thing is where Harry and George go through a quick ride on the highway, and looking back, George gives the driver an open salute. But there are also some nice scenes, especially the impressive use of close-up pictures of hands - the hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands reach hands, hands and reach the love and friendship. This is a real cinema that touches the heart. There are very impressive scenes where George suggested to Natalie, where George embraces Harry's head in his hands, where George continues to call his dear mother, where George Harry laughs .. I felt there was a deep message in the film that life is beautiful - the presence of grass itself That he cries when his story?), Upper trees, bird song, small insects - all the miraculous natural objects. They are all there to enjoy looking back (like Harry and George) look around and listen ... beautiful movie.
