On Discovery, this film follows the life of one family living in a sleepy town on the island of British Columbia. To its dreamers, are content to allow life to continue around them until a new young teacher with new ideas comes and brings her life from the mainland. Slowly, their slow state is awakened, and the father (and the local school principal) is looking for excitement, the mother for stability, the oldest daughter of love, the younger the power. Although it is not an amazing or unprecedented cinematic piece, the movie is pleasantly quiet and good to spend a tiring night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I suspect that anyone outside of Canada will be easily accessible.
