This very funny British comedy shows what might happen if a section of London, in this case Pimlico, declares its independence from the rest of the UK and its laws, taxes and postwar restrictions. Cheerful chaos is what will happen. <br /> <br /> A wartime bomb explodes old documents showing that Pimlico had been ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy for centuries, a small historical footnote he had forgotten for a long time. However, for the new Burgundians, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free of any interference from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is an excellent politician of the small city who suddenly finds himself leading one of the smallest countries in the world. Mrs. Margaret Rutherford is a joy as a professor of history standing alongside Pimlico. Among the other actors who took part in the tournament were Hermione Padelli, Paul Dobles, Notton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Herdern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
