In fact I did not start watching the show until it was introduced to the foreign exchange market. I was bored and I had nothing to watch and I saw the replays were preliminary so I decided to watch it. I was so angry that I did not watch the show when it was first broadcast on television. I liked the show a lot, and finally a show that everyone enjoyed. I remember "full house affairs" and "step by step" and they were good shows but not funny enough. They would go stupid jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not in the seventies. The show of the 1970s was a joy, a smart and a very real one. I think it was the best show ever presented, and I'm very sorry it ended. Although I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. Last season was not true, and Eric was the main character and had to end the show when his character left. I still love this program and I hope that TV will start offering more programs like this one.
