The movie was just fun .... maybe the most fun for those of us who were young and loved the movie "The Ramones" shortly before the film's production. I have watched the movie repeatedly, myself and with friends, and it is still new and funny. At the risk of being very serious, the notion that you are a great fan of a particular band is time-free, and the boredom of high school students with certain classes is not without forever. <br /> <br /> Some gemstone lines / sights ... show how to keep track of our "permanent record" in high school during life. (Let me assure you that I was out of high school for, uh, a few years ago and not following me) ..... The famous line "I'm getting some sleep" ..... "Not as much as you get ", With the approach of the Director-General Tujar) ..... Member of the Board of Directors of the school, which suffers from severe loss attended by the nurses .... The Nazi Hall monitors the" physical search "... ... Director Togar," I give you Final Solution ", burning Ramones records (Note: Records were the ones that came before CDs) .... Of course Joey Ramone," Things have definitely changed since we left high school, "followed by Togar asking" Does your father know you're Rammons?"<br /> <br /> Just one tip ..... Do not look for the stars' place now ..... Joey Ramon died with a young man's grief. Dai Young, who was the main hottie in the film, reminds us all today of age .... Never did the career of PJ Soles ever progress as we expected ... Marla Rosenfeld, as one of the other students, appears to have appeared only in this film (One of my male friends dies on it every time we watch the movie), although I do her best performance was more than enough and she should have brought her more cinematic roles in her teens. Does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steel? <br /> <br /> So, watch and enjoy ..... do not think .... just enjoy!
