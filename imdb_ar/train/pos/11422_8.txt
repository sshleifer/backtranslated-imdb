Claire Dennis Chucklet is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the family of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer a useful view on the lives and interactions of many characters. However, the development of these characters is often insufficient. For example, the main theme of the story is the inability of French youth to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is flawlessly executed, especially in the way Dennis puts the story with scenes of France's return to her childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy with other film characters makes it difficult for the viewer to invest much attention in her development (Or not) as a hero. The general stagnation of the personality development of the film makes it difficult to engage in this loose conspiracy. The film raises a lot of tension between characters, especially between Amy and the men in her life, but he did not address this social friction completely, leaving the exhibitor unhappy. The last few scenes are strong but frustrating. Dennis's work is certainly intellectually and historically interesting, but if you're looking for a movie full of adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
