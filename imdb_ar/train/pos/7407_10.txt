This film took me by surprise. I saw it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There were many facts posed by this film. I love all the characters in this film as well. This film has great meaning because as society becomes "more advanced", what is lost by culture? The preaching does not seem. I can really deal with this film from the cover of my child and to lose my life will never return or was as it is. This movie is in the best 5 movies I have ever seen. There is a very harsh truth I feel when I watch a movie and not some sort of truth that you should look for to get it right in front of your face. The creators of this film did a great job and enjoyed this movie a lot. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you'll like it.
