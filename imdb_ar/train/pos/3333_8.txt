I got this on board to NZ last week and I was wondering how it would measure both the UK film and the book. I must say I was impressed with the favorable. If anything, the Red Sox fanatic association during lean years works better than Arsenal FC's original dedication, which has been a success over the years. As a Briton, I was also interested in seeing that you do not need to understand baseball to get what is going on. One question comes to mind - has the script been written using Sox as a team even before it finally breaks Bambino's curse? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (and I know it's strange, a British who understands baseball), I must say he added to the fun.
