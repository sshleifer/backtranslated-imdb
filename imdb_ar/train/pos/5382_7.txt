After watching a live TV series from Next Action Star, I was delighted to see the winners' movie immediately. I was careful of this offer of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and happy. Billy Zan, of course, was the usual great self, but Corinne and Shawn were sitting next to them. It was also good to see Jared and Jan (also from the competition) in their respective roles. Sean's character, not Billy, is chasing, playing his frustration by discovering new rules in the game well. Corrine walks on a tight rope between her character who likes Sean and her presence only for money. I loved how the game played directly until the last second. And then! It's not a great movie, but it's an entertaining movie along the way and a great show for two people the first time they come out of the gate.
