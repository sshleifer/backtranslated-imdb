It was fun when this show was going on because it was a new, innovative and original show. This makes every show I've ever seen look plain boring. The moment the first episode was broadcast, I was an input and easily associated with all the characters (which usually never happens because I always hate some characters). It's unfortunate that this show will not have a third season, because it should be one of the best shows I've ever seen and it does not exaggerate my feelings for the show at all. Nothing can replace "Daisies", because what ABC could find to replace this offer? This is easily the best program on TV. <br /> <br /> I came for Christine Chinatown and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
