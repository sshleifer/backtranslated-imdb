The Giants Ride is an incredible documentary film detailing the history and stories of three influential wave surfers, Greg Knoll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did a great job and took on the director's role and should be congratulated for doing such a wonderful job. The movie structure is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with narration, interviews, animations and browsing. Music soundtracks increase overall satisfaction with watching this film, making it a great sight to watch. Highlights include none of Greg Noll's comments, what is directly explicit, Laird Hamilton's Teahupoo shots, and the outside menus at the end of the film. But this entire film is really a big highlight, highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It is shameful that it is not more famous, but it is a jewel worthy of attention. 10/10
