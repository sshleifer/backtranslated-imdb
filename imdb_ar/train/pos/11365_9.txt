Well, let's start by saying that this film is not an accurate rendition of the crimes and the legal pursuit of Andr√© Chicatello. While it may be "official policy" in the Politburo that the Soviet Union had no killers infiltrators, in fact the legal system had dealt with others, and "Killer X" (as it was already called) was already being sought when brought Fetisov Borakov to the case. In fact, once they realized that they had committed multiple murders at their own hands, the authorities assigned a task force consisting of dozens of officers to track down and end the wave of murder for a man who did not fit what he thought was a regular serial killer. It is good for the director and the book to constantly mention that the story is "based only on actual events", for this drama file is not. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> However, this is a good example of Hollywood's fast-paced Hollywood feature that still transcends the basics of what happened. It is easy to follow and has enough truth behind its version of the events that can be made for a convincing presentation. Yes, Chicatello raped and killed children and adults, both male and female. Yes, he was called by the poor laboratory work the freedom to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men have been accused of murder and "confessed" their crimes to the police. Yes, the gay community was harassed during the commission of the crimes (despite Borakov's assistance). And yes, Chicatello was brought to the confession not by harassing the prosecutor, Gorbunov, but through the gentle understanding of a psychologist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov was nowhere near the selfish martinette portrayed in this film). Dodgers around truth and honesty aside, all these events play in a way that constantly stresses tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that director and co-writer Chris Girulmo has a perfect crew. Stephen Ree's growing emotional involvement in the killings and the development of expertise in the discovery of clues and manipulations of Donald Sutherland's rudimentary Soviet hacking and the delicate spine that becomes obvious when needed, Jeffrey Dimon hides in anger hiding from fearful behavior The silent excitement of the iPhone Sido for being part of a criminal investigation, All of which promote sharp dialogue and clear liberalization in ways that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Because of what it is, Citizen X is almost perfect ("almost" because of a self-congratulatory moment in the end that does not suit it). It's highly recommended that it's a good fantasy, not really showing ... but considering the unwanted "Serial Killer" movies that Hollywood spits, that's good for me.
