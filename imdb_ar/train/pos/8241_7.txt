Very strange film. In many ways, very good idea. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching, how was hell in the way of marketing this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog's story blended with the fifties comedy nostalgia with zombies. Does not move completely out of the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has little of the Shun massacre, laughing and laughing. He is a completely different monster (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido begins with a black-and-white information story that explains the background story - humans have won a war against the zombie by developing a control collar that subjects people who eat meat to stupid servants. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought we were in paranoia during the Cold War, a parody of Matini, but soon we were thrown into a world of bright colors and backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a single child that does not fit the school. His mother is a potential social climber, and his father is tense and detached. <br /> <br /> In pursuit of Jones, my mother (Carrie Anne Moss) has become coma. Jimmy was not interested at first, but "Fido" (Billy Connelly) soon proved to be a great friend of Jimmy. So that his collar shines ... <br /> <br /> Fido is not a horror film, but my problem with the film is knowing exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> A lot of humor is from a variety of light families, and sometimes the plot line relies heavily on the boy and his moments with his dog / family. <br /> <br /> However, the film is filmed in great dark moments and really funny, while welcoming, will ensure R rating for what is, for long periods, a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie looks great, and is beautifully executed by all involved. <br /> <br /> His difficult color problems, I hope this film finds a suitable place, because it is a small gem in the flood of film this year.
