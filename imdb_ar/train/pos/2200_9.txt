Like many children, these and Ding Dong School are my first memories of television. Since they both ran later in the union, it is difficult to determine how many of these memories are actually associated with the original broadcast. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" worth checking for more nostalgic value. It represents a completely different style from the comedy position of programs such as "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy".

The producer of the series, Fred Ko, a prominent figure in early television who deserves his dramatic selections ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase", "Playwrights" Fireside ", etc.) even on a filmstrip. <br /> <br />" Mr. Peepers "was a very nice style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of" Underdog "after a few years) in the title role, Robinson Piebers, a moderate secondary science teacher.
