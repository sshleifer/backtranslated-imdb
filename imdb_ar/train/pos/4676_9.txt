I found this film thought-provoking, and its ambiguity thrives in a world of fast-fix films, where we are manipulated to love the "good man" and hate the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of photographing the lamb / black child who wants to win his father's love and respect, as well as the love of his widowed wife who seems to have history. Good Hirsch plays against the image of his usual leg as a father who triangulated his children and is now the one who has always rejected him. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was fascinated by the wonderful way wood sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is the right successor to traditional "ordinary people". Just realized, Josh Hersh was in it too!
