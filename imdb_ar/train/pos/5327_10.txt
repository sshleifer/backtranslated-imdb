As a knowledgeable admirer, I recommend this movie as true to the facts and well behaved. When I was in Istanbul at the age of eleven, I heard some friends talking about a new sense of music making girls cry. I thought hmmmm, if the girls like them, must be crap. My only records until then were Healy Mills, Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly after my vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Izmir, I heard a song (later known as "I Love Me Doing") and was influenced by the difference between it and every song I had heard until then. When I heard the album "Meet The Beatles" for my older brother I was hooked. After reading the final book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this film followed the facts well except for leaving most of the sex and some drug abuse (did not touch the use of methadrine / dexadarin). >
