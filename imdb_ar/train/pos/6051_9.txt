It's a great British film. Cleverly scripted with many quoteable lines, embodying exactly what magic mushrooms can do for a man over the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent alongside that under the British actor Jeff Bell. Peter Bulls with a hinged suspension of his mouth is a major blow in the casting and Gary Stritch with his cocks looks brings something strange to the atmosphere of this piece. Although it seems to have been described as a biker's film, I think it will find an audience outside, on the assumption that many people have done so and carried the T-shirts. Also great original soundtrack with blinding version of Freebird. This really can be the heir to the 21st century for the famous Ealing comedy. Like weeds in Welsh fields: It's a farmer!
