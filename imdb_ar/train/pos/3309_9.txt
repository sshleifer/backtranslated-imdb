This is a great movie. If this is any indication, it is Hong Sang-Soo is "the secret of the worst Asian cinema". It's very similar to Tsai Ming Liang and Hui Hsiao Hsin's style, and covers many of the same subject matter, but I think I enjoy it more generally than any of their films. The public minimum is a little less visible here than their work, although it still fits this pattern perfectly (the camera never moves even once), and somehow found that the film is less "conscious" than the consciousness of Tsai Ming Liang or Hu Hsiao-Hsin , Which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it the most. In addition, it does not keep the topics separate just as Hou does. I felt that the film was also "somewhat more complete" and less open (barely) than some of their work, although this did not mean that it contained much of anything resembling an influential plot. I found it hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly affected by this film about "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman walking around herself, and I can not stay in her hotel room wearing bad but apparently worn panties).
