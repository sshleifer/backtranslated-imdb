Sudden Impact is the fourth of Dirty Harry's films. One of the best features of these films is that they do not actually deteriorate in quality from film to film. Thus, Sudden Impact provides another thrill during the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. Harry is trying to solve a series of murders during his vacation. Harry always seems to work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry while all his men play in motion, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first Dirty Harry films produced in the 1980s, Sudden Impact lacks a sense of the 70's that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that the quality is lower. Bottom line: With extreme surprise and movement, Sudden Impact is another addition worthy of the Dirty Harry series.
