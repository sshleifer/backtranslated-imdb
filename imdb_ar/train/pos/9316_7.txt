Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who has a criminal case in The Unknown Man, a 1951 film that starred Anne Harding, Barry Sullivan, and how Brazil and Richard Anderson. A big believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a case in defense of a young man, Rudy and Cheek (Brazil), charged with murder and acquitted. Soon after, he realized that the man was guilty and that he was devouring protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. Advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudy is a simple change, and that to eliminate organized crime, one has to find the top man. Mason finds the top man, and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white film that manages to maintain the viewer's interest through its various distortions, despite a somewhat fabricated plot. It really is the story of a good man looking for his God and his justice, and what he is willing to do in order to achieve it. This is the busiest part of all. I suppose there was a time before OJJ, Menendez Brothers, etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of lawyers. For those scenes anyway, those days ended for a long time. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his handsome, elegant and impressive voice shows us a successful and confident man but also a very interested man. Pidgeon had a great career spanning 60 years, but never rose to stardom. He was a strong actor who could play anything and do it. This may be because by the time he got strings, he was in his thirties, and missed himself as if he were loved. Or perhaps he lacked something particular; or that he was written early as the second lead to a great star such as Greer Garrison. Hard to say. Performs honest and effective performance here. Very good movie with good performance.
