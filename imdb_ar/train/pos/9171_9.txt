I am a fan of Jane Eyre and an extremist, and this release contains all the important details of the book almost, and the characters are portrayed as I imagined. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great richness and can not be delivered correctly in the feature length format, so it needs a small television series. Timothy Dalton Rochester is the best ever. There was a lot of debate about his attractiveness and age. In his book, Jane (narrator) described him as "about 35 years old" and not a young man, but not after middle age. I think Timothy Dalton was 38 when he did that, that's right. Also, we only have a Jane's opinion as to whether Rochester is handsome. I just met him and asked her frankly what she thought. As an inexperienced and modest girl, I can not imagine her saying she thought he was handsome. The actor who plays the role of Rochester needs to show us the character of the man, and this is ideally accomplished. I like the relationship between the two lists, which is crucial in this story, and the humor in their confrontations. I have copied other versions, but that's true. The 2006 version with Toby Stevens, 37, is in progress on the BBC1 and is very good already, so I will decide if this is my favorite when it is complete. <br /> <br /> When viewing this series again, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this release with Timothy Dalton and Zella Clark is the best! The Charlotte Bronte dialogue is maintained and this is essential to the strength of the story. The update does not work - it's a Victorian-style story and an old poetry discourse that suits the characters. This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is very small and the difference in length between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is a great actor. There are no additional scenes to convert from the plot scenario includes all the basic scenes, but excludes unnecessary details, making them handy. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
