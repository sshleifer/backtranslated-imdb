I think it's a great movie. Because you know how to live Diana's life at home. I got a lot of aggression and wanted to prove that the girls could also fight. I think she and Adrian were fantastic actors. Because of this film I am also boxing. I really liked it. The only negative part I think. it's the end. Because it is fine between Diana and Adrian. But you can not see how she is at home. I did not really like you also could not see how her father, her brother did. But I think it was a great movie and I think I'll see it much more: I recommend it to anyone, so if you do not like boxing, you'll see more than just boxing. I've had a great time watching it.
