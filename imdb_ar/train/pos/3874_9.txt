I adore Isabelle Place !!! She was very nice in this film and was quite different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal" where she was more human. I think she had to run for Guetta. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabel was much better, IMO. Belletti did a good job for the first time off the pitch and noticed that he had infiltrated two of his friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles and Guy A. LePage & Andre Ducharme. It was good to see them in this, I did not know they would show up. <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw a romantic comedy from Quebec I did not like, and this one is as good as any I was pleased to see. And if you're in the states wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD, the www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.
