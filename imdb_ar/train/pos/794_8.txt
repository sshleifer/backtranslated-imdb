I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andy McDowell's performance was subtle and weak. For one time, MacDowell's film director did not make her beauty another character in the film. Romance between Kate and her lovely young man to watch and he plays very well. Her relationship with her friends is a thorn and a balm in her life. Emilda Stallinson, who has been an MVP in many British films, is doing a great job in this area. There is some tragedy in this, but I believe that the film has been saved in the end through wonderful acting, clean direction, and smart writing. The film quality is excellent and the music is good, although not available in the audio track.
