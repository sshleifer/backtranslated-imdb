This was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last film, and died of cancer nine days after the shooting was completed. All this makes the main scene in the film more moving. <br /> <br /> Although some hairstyles and clothes are a bit old (also note the video game shown in the movie), but the theme of the film is pretty immortal. Heston said he wanted to make the film for a while because he really believed in the dangers of overcrowding. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie classic. The story is strong. <br /> <br /> Acting is top notch, especially the interaction between Houston and Robinson, with nice shows also for Coutin and Petters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The combination of Beethoven, Greg, and Tchaikovsky along with pastoral visual elements make for some really impressive scenes. This was a shading on the film. <br /> <br /> The subject (or "point") of the film is important. Yes, it's a movie about overcrowding, but in a more important observation, it's a warning story about what can happen with human land management. In the sub-text you find the real message of the movie. Pay attention to what Seoul says about the "old days" of the past (and this is our present), and observe how Thorne is unable to understand what Seoul is saying. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best science fiction movies of all time.
