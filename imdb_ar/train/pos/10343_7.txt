The film "Mr. Mister Williams" starring the film "Melvin Douglas," which produced five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star, Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five films that year, did three of them! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams, and he and his colleagues are presented with a corpse, and they must know what actually happened. Viewers will recognize his colleagues at work - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald McBride, Don Bedo) have always held positions in power ... senators, bank heads, police. This person who is not dressed in comedy, where the police always throw blows at each other, even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. Some interesting gags - Williams takes the man who was arrested on a date with his girlfriend. There's a lot of fun here, so skip the slow start and wait for the funniest things later. Do not want to give up any spoilers, so you'll have to pick them up on Turner Classic Movies. The director Alexander Hall mostly worked as a comedian and was reportedly working with Lucy at some point.
