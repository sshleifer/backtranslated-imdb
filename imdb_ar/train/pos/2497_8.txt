In fact, it appears that drug abuse, shooting in warehouses, and shooting the "Matrix", a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races, and the only vampires - all in the same movie - a story that can only be imagined pop star / Japanese Rock. This is exactly what is a "baby moon" and more. While all these elements may look like the perfect theme for B-campy for the week, Moon Child pulls it with some bumps and obstacles along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a completely angry and independent feeling, jumping from one scene to another not in a smooth transition, but leaps and bounds, giving a glimpse of the characters' lives and hardly ever plotting a real plot. But the film offers no excuse, and instead turns the story into a story of friendship, love, trust and betrayal of all the sugar-coated elements in the above-mentioned elements of a future society, warring gangs, and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE Since the sad Vampire "Kei" is excellent, giving the depth a distinctive character and balancing Gackt's exuberant behavior as "Sho", an orphan certified by Kei. Li Hom Wang also shines as a "son" revenge that becomes friends with Xu. The story revolves around these characters, their friends and extended family members across different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily be transformed into grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> While sometimes work is always unrealistic and special effects appear only to show off, the only thing the film is not supposed to be is about the famous Asian singers. The stars as actors have their flaws, as well as their characters. The film rarely becomes boring and ends where it should, after jumping almost a bit. The Baby Moon is fairly fun, and sometimes humorous, and so very moving: it's definitely worth your time!
