Well, what can I say that I just watched this wonderful movie, when my nerves were still shaking! Jacques Odeiard has to be his name in France, and he is right. Vince Cassell is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuel Davos is not Penelope Cruz either, but these two actors are wonderful, and this suspenseful and compelling film begins slowly with some eminent characters and then begins to put tension on the superbly peak tension. Others wrote about the plot, so I would not say more than that everyone in this film plays his role in perfection, director, actors, down to the photographer, everything seems very real, do not play dumb gun, fighting when it happens to be very credible, Expressions, emotions, as if I were there as a spectator. Get yourself a DVD and a bottle of wine and turn off the lights and take the phone out of the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian movie :)
