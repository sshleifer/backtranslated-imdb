I love this show! <br /> <br /> Each time I watch a loop I repeat this line and remind myself how good this presentation is. I am a big fan of science fiction, and this show has reasons to be the most important scientific program (fictional?) In the history of film / television. There are so many theories in this presentation about the universe that I can begin religion. It's a great program and season after season, where the show improves and the best. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (now 19) and find it ironic that my favorite TV show of all time is Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting to have each letter is completely opposite to the other. <br /> <br /> Back when I first saw Stargate, I immediately liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi clicks, and then I heard the TV show was going around, I was really excited, but I did not get an appointment until the fifth season ended Approximately. <br /> <br /> Even so, I'm disappointed when I heard that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted a triple film but the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> The ID says it turned out to be fine. Probably better. <br /> <br /> This offer is great, and I hope it does not die. Atlantis we come here!
