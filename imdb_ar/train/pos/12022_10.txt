As a great admirer of the original, this film avoided the plague when the bad reviews began to appear eight years ago, but I just finished watching this film and found it really pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are looking for an update for the original, you are very disappointed, but if you are looking for something quite different and a bit political, this is the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher at his old elementary school, where he is chased by a fellow teacher and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When the student insists on Gregory's interview, it follows a series of adventures that include torture, breaking, entering and all kinds of unexpected transformations and turns that left me feeling happy and moving. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I just wish that more people would have gone to see it when it was released and seen it.
