For a Danish film, I must say, it's a very good film. <br /> <br /> He is in his own category, although he has international potential. <br /> <br /> He has a big budget, starring well-known Danish actors, and a few newcomers who play well. Can be seen by anyone who likes adventures, and a bit of the movie "Ghost". <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be happy!
