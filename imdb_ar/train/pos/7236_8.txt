This film is available for David Sheppard and Keno in "Before Hollywood was Fort Lee", New Jersey, although it is a shortened version that contains only "behind the scenes" movie clips.I'm not sure that Blackhawks Films had a movie just copy Of these parts, or they edited the other scenes. Blackhawk's original version was "Movie Movie", but the full feature still exists, but the pre-print of this release had some nitrate decomposition, and two bad sections appeared, which may be the reason for editing Blackhawk. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film features the role of Tourneur, or probably a cartoon His film, Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg, is also projected. <br /> <br /> Country lass Mary (Doris Kenyon) is longing for a romantic man to sweep her feet, dreaming of the trouble of a turbulent she will attract, The only local boy available, Johnny Appblum. <br /> <br /> Hile, a film company from New York (actually New Jersey), is filming a western film in the countryside, seeing an Indian Mary (in the full headdress) and raising the alarm - A scene conceived by the film company. She is immediately attracted to the famous film star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When you reach the studio, you discover that everything about the movies is fake. Doors and walls are just apartments that are assembled hastily for the group. The hero's walk from the Western hero or the happy jump of the heroine are also acting. The groups are in a large rotational phase, so they can manipulate the angle of the sun. The studio's black companion signs all the "signed" images of the movie stars. Signs on the wall say "positively no smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the titles of the film (well-described) confirm everything false about the life of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie Driscoll is totally unpopular with the hustle and bustle of everyday filmmaking. He makes a temporary separation from his girlfriend Vivian (June Elfidge) to follow this rural girl "thrilling". His plans crashed when the screen of Mary was stinking. We could not see the actual film, but only the audience's painful reactions to it. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to recognize everyone at home as failing, so keep seeing Driscoll as we dine with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras worn by cops, soldiers, cowboys and so on. <br /> <br /> Mary decided to stay with Driscoll. In a concert with their film "Friends", agree to marry him despite the lack of great love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appears with a special cake on the occasion of Mary's birthday. This leads Mary to reassess her future. <br /> <br /> This movie contains all kinds of great scenes for studios, movie sets, dressing rooms, editorial rooms, and so on. If you always wonder what happened behind the scenes when a silent movie was made, this film looks behind the curtain.
