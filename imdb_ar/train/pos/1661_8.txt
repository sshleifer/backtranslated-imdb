(Spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the comprehensive appeal of inaccurate LOTR .. such things are now easier to excuse) I liked art. Although not really a home movie art. They provide emotionally charged little sights from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. 1. It's very short. And 2. The sound you hear whispers from time to time is not shown. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Reboot: 5/10
