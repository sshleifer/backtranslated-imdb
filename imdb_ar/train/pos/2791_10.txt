This is one of my favorite movies all the time and I would recommend it to anyone. In the list of favorite films (Mind Menu, Mind), the only movies on par with it are films like Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I can really link the main character to Jess. At the beginning of the film, she is a shy girl with a slightly bizarre background and has far more friends than boys than girls. It really sucks you in her life. Surely I can not make mistakes in any of the actions of the protagonist or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting to watch even for someone like me who had no idea about the rules. The film is never boring. The romance is really nice and did not make me blush tooooo hard! The only thing that really made him an Indian worker. Jess's parents are Indians and there are many colorful Indian conferences throughout the film that provide a very interesting cultural view as well as everything else. Indian people are also hilarious! Basically, this is an old movie about choosing the track you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> I feel that good comedy movies have become my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. It's funny, it's refreshing and makes you feel comfortable! ^ _ ~
