The first thing I thought of after watching the film "The Mysterious Man" is how can this film be unpopular? I found this movie adorable and funny enough to put it as a bomb defying logic. Well, I hope this becomes a great success in the future, and you can prepare me for his fans. <br /> <br /> Simply, without giving much, this film does for comic books what "Princess Bride" did for the fairy tales and "Framed by Rabbit Roger?" I did about classic cartoons. This should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the tone of the film, and the marketing committee was unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases like "Iron Giant" where the studio had no idea what it was in his hands). Hire her the next time you are in a mood for something eccentric. You will not listen to BeeGees with the same light again.
