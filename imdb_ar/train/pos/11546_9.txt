First seen at all: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> A very impressive script, acting and playful timing in this film. Now 40 years, has not lost any strength. Neil Simon presents an excellent insight into nature and human relationships as well as how to create a real comedy of unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau offer great comedy shows. Neil Simon was inspired by the actual events in his life to write the play on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best written comics and actress in Hollywood of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, he was nominated only for the Oscars: Best Adapted Script and Best Film. Hollywood rarely awards comic awards, no matter how well they make them.
