I was surprised by the low ratings that this film got from viewers. I saw her late at night on TV and hit the place - I actually think it was in 1989 when it first appeared. However I remember it well, with a nice touch or two, and an interesting ambience at the farm of the windmill. Michael Pollard seems to be well prepared for his role, which largely sums up the early promise that has yet to be achieved by his career, and is played straight forward by others. I would certainly recommend it as a rent, although some features, which may have seemed a bit agitated in 1989, may seem trivial now, a shame, given that contemporary "modernity" is often used as a necessary marketing tool, For Note.
