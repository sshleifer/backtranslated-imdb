This film is an excellent military film. The Hollywood movie may not be excellent, but it does not matter. Hollywood has the reputation of sacrificing precision for good entertainment, but that's not the case in this film. Other reviewers have found this film too slow for their taste, but ?? As a retired soldier? I appreciate the speed with which the film crew deliberately took their story as fully as possible, considering two hours and nine minutes. The story has been narrated and re-listed several times, but it remains a professional soldier ?? And African American in it? To provide a report on the story as presented by the film crew, as the US Navy progressed to the world. Barashir's story of becoming a naval diver, and his life as a submarine after his graduation, is not the only story to be presented. There is also a story of how the Chief Chief Petty Officer Sunday challenged an illegal commanding officer who was not passed from Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear in his test no matter how well, and paid for the loss of a strip and changing the job. The real story also tells how Bershir found the missing three hydrogen bombs in the Atlantic Ocean off the Spanish coast in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another sailor who was on the sudden jogging line that would have cut him in two if Barashir did not push him away and took the bullet himself . It was a complex story worth telling, and I would admit that two and nine minutes were not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the scenes on the DVD that the crew did their best to tell a story as fully as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story recounted in a comprehensive way, and because I see maritime traditions and honor preserved in a natural and complete way.
