Well, there are a lot of reviews here, so what can I add? <br /> <br /> I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is my favorite scoundrel is because of everything. Groups, outdoor sites, fashion is very beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The cast is supported very well. One of my favorites is Narrator and his nephew, played by Roger Reese. His sincerity reduced his touch and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also Bob Krisht absolutely believable. His life is difficult, but he is still positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of course is George C. Scott in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said his portrayal is very brave. I could not have been more different. His initial exchanges, while cold or harsh, were not far from personal. He is a man of terrible disappointment whose heart has been strengthened by the vicissitudes of life and his lust for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the memories of the past, it is clear that not all of them are Chikya. This is where we see hope. If he has completely disappeared, his partner Marley will never come for him in the first place. After all, we are not one of us hoping in the past. I think that's a big part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance to his employer with Belle, you see him smiling sadly as he tells Bill in the flashback that he will pass a life "smiling at my face" Clive Donner was clever enough as a way out to allow these moments in the film. Sometimes they are left on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> Finally, the process of converting it is full of joy that makes me cry from tears of joy every time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, very loyal, very moving, is not only the spirit of Christmas, but the spirit of humanity itself. The joy that Fred brings to his wife is very clear. The line that strikes me every time, "God forgive me for the time you wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
