I think this film got a low rating because it was rated as the worst moments. There is a joke of diarrhea and an embarrassing sight of walnuts, but apart from that there are actually a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee performs some great comedy in this film, and Julia Steeles managed to be very funny. Apart from the fact that this film acts like most romantic comedy films, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Whichever is better than most, where already known after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, the best movies to watch but definitely not the worst choice ... Cheers
