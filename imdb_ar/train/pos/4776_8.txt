I was watching this movie in one of my usual times, which is real real late at night. Usually if the film does not care, I start to sleep and have to raid the refrigerator to keep awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought this was what I had to do since this movie started slowly along with the fact that its shots tend to stay with the character for a long time. But shortly after, she began to enter the film, where more was revealed about the main character by recounting his story. In the end, you feel familiar with it throughout your life. The film kept my interest so much that I did not even know that the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> There was not much of a weird Lynch style, but there are enough exotic characters to make the movie amusing.
