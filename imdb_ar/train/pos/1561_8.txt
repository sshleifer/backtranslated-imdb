I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing the flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Akaman (although all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. The vision of most of the founders of the Association of Justice trying to overthrow Lex Luthor is what I was waiting for. This seems far from the subject, but making a live presentation to the University of Justice would certainly make me have reason to pay all I normally do during the week down the exchange just to see one episode. This is the excitement I got from watching this episode. I wish I had made this episode a little longer, like two special hours, because I felt that one hour of the League of Justice was not enough. Now before I bear you (unless I already have my own rowing) I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. It was kind of touching when the show started focusing on Lana. But I'm sure the book will go back to the hole pit. :( So enjoy this episode, who knows when another one will get out, get it again this Thursday, February 22nd, if you miss the first broadcast.
