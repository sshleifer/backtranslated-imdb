Imaginary Space Ideal Movie. A group of children accidentally climb into space, and they have to go back, but they do, of course. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Cabasso, the lead lady, to perform the Golden Globe, but unfortunately she and Lisa Thompson won one. This is so bad. I can not say enough, this movie is so wonderful Lea Thompson, the perfect girl for this film. This movie is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars was overrated and the space camp was too low. It should be the opposite. <br /> <br /> Excellent 10 / 10- 0r Maybe 11/10. I'm not good at mathematics
