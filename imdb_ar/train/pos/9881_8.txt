In western Hollywood, those heavy hands were a tough handful when they came to the city and were part of Hardy. After all, driving was on a single business trip the day before the railroad reached all over the United States. <br /> <br /> The controversy that worked for Gil Trail was not the same as Eric Fleming's. But Fleming was a man of all business, and he had a job to do and hire a large crew to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long term of Rawhide and the fact that regulars have stayed with most of them, we have identified all the differences at some point. The focus was on some story lines around her, although the bulk was with the character of Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rudy Yates, the second man with the herd. <br /> <br /> The image of Clint Eastwood West is formed by Rawhide, it is a shame that these do not often appear. Probably because it was done in black and white. If this was a NBC show, it would have been done in color like Bonanza and will run as much as these shows. We'll see more about a man becoming a legend of the movement. <br /> <br /> Ironically it was Eric Fleming who left the show before closing. Few of them did and he hoped the offer would give him a name for the film. Unfortunately, he was killed at a movie site doing an action film and drowning in the river. If he lived, he would have become a name like Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as manager of the season last season and the show was completed. And of course he became the icon he is today and not only in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough players. There is no welfare in this, they were pastoral shepherds working just for their mission and fighting the elements and whatever positions are thrown out every year. <br /> <br /> They are no longer making such TV series. Unfortunately.
