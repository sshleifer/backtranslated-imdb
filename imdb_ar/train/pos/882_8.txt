I picked this up on the whim of the library and was very surprised. Lots of narrow work, expressive camera, equally narrow texts, and two wonderful actors all mingled together to make one film very good. The brain is not multi-reptile, it is the true meaning of cinema. If Hollywood puts its gloomy hands at all, I'm sure it will destroy them. Option to treat along the way. The other posters here sang too much, so there's no need to bother repeating them. Just take their advice, advice, and do not miss this gem. You name it; I call it two hours of well spent entertainment. Read my lips: Do not miss it.
