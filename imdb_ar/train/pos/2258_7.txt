I think Sarafina is a tremendous effort from Whoopi Goldberg. Beside her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with children in urban areas, I think this is an important film to show the history of apartheid in South Africa. Sarafina is a film about education and teacher relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for almost nothing in the video store. I watched it and quickly sent it through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to teachers and students to understand it. Now, while I do not know the other actresses and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am happy that they have portrayed a team and a team from South Africa except Goldberg in a small role but if that makes people see this film, Whoopi reaches a global appeal.
