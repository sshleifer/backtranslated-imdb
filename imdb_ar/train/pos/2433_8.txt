I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Casper the Friendly Ghost". It should be noted that it was early because Casper did not appear to be true, in the same way that Porky Pig does not seem to be true in the old caricatures of the 1930s. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode in phantom delusional life is interested in getting acquainted with the young fox called Verdi. I remember being happy to see Casper have a friend, because those who have seen the cartoons will not realize that most people are fleeing him, shouting "Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie enjoy some fun together until someone else appears ... I hate to leave you with half a spoiler, but the cartoons are only seven minutes long, so you can not be too vague. In addition, anyone can read an IMDb summary of animation deducing what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit tragic. In fact, this may be the worst I've ever felt to see cartoons. But that only means that she moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not on many others. Or see, the fact that I remember these cartoons at all is due to their emotional impact on me - I have not seen them since. But the cartoons end in an optimistic tone, and I am pleased to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I will give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. In second place after Warner Bros.'s animated film "Peace on Earth", this is what has been most animated in a short animated film.
