This film is wonderful because it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way that the child prefers, for adults. The idea that a child's drawing can be a place you can actually visit and have an impact on is a wonderful thing. At the same time, every child's world can look at it and say that it really explores consciousness, as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The thing that gives me pimples is when her father is in the paper house, chasing her. The only thing I can not afford is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it is not. If you want to see something British contains a lot of stories that keep you guessing without the usual cheap excitement that most movies should use, then watch Paperhouse.
