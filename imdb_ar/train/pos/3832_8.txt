Late one night on an abandoned road, in an empty salon, Martin Shin spins a boulevard of Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and his friends who are hunting down a group of murderous cattle thief, who killed a number of men and kidnapped Cassidy girl. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola Mai provoked William Boyd's fundamentalist fury by daring to produce a modern low-budget film featuring his beloved Hoppe, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be associated with a representative so no one else is allowed to play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update for classic programmers in the 1930s and 1940s. Although he is guilty of some bad behavior, this is serious enough and humble, making it difficult for me to hate. <br /> <br /> Although the whole production is a little strange, I really enjoyed the scenes between Shane and Carden. The fact that we are watching a story within the story makes the strangeness and exaggeration more acceptable.
