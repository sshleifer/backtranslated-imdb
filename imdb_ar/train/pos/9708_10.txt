I have never seen this program before, although it is recommended by my family. It was fun to have my girlfriend live in the Hadfield (location of photography) and made some highlights when I first visited. <br /> <br /> That's what interested me, so I bought the first series on the video and sat in a watch. In addition to identifying some sites, I did not find myself surprised. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the world's finest comedies. TLOG is easily categorized as Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as the best. <br /> <br /> Enough to say that I am addicted to the program now. The characters are wonderful and show extraordinary depth while maintaining a real intermittent advantage. The look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no matter how hardfield is, which I found very welcoming and warm.) Authenticity throughout its period (based on the second series that ended in the UK last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Well done BBC !!
