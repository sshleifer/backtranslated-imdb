This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in this subtype. It was produced by Roger Korman, who has already produced a number of WIP programs. It is clear that the movie is trying to play the fixed format. The film is being held in a prison in the United States of America, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if this is a wise move, but it is an acceptable change in speed. The writer / director Demi starts his work, always looking for new ways to present a familiar scenario. In fact, he is a bit ambitious for his own good. The director creates a number of surreal dream sequences that represent rough boundaries, but it is interesting to see how difficult it is to try to place this film above the normal series click. But do not worry, Demme still works under subtype criteria. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which pleases hardcore fans. The film is a bit slow, but very enjoyable. Good cast. Roberta Collins is a veteran of the WIP program, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is the crazy guard with wheelchairs. Pam Greer is sorely lacking, though.
