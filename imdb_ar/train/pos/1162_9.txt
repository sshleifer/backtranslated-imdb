Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I thought it was awesome. But I did not know he had a sister! Justin Priestley is simply "Mah" infiltrated like other sarcastic women. Good music, intrigue, and death scene Amanda's revenge on an abusive doctor will stay with you for weeks. I'll leave it at that. Glory.
