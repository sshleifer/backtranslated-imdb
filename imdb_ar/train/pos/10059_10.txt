This movie is the best film ever. I can not remember the last time a tear came out of me. With a tear in my eyes, I admire this film. It contains all the elements that must be included in the good film: excellent dialogues, music, representation, story / story. A story of friendship, courage, affection and loyalty between the performance of the famous street of the masked king and a little girl sold as a boy in the market of serfs a little girl loved to be his granddaughter and loved the king of masks a grandson. They were not traditional in real. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera action is flawless and controls you. Representation inspired. Xu Chu was excellent as the king of masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks pretty and played her character very well. Chigang Zhao Liang Sao Lange was wonderful. His good and good character played very well. If you do not have this movie, try it once, and watch it.
