I saw the thief first as a child making me older than the jinn I think. As any child would be, I was delighted with imagination, creativity and energy in the film. After several years, I realized how much satire and lightness the script I missed at first sight. I have never had the chance to see it during the intervening years. In addition to the script, production exceeds this imaginative type. This is Korda, storytellers at his best. When you see a thief as a child, you know you've had a good time. When you see a thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It`s as timeless as the story treats. good job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
