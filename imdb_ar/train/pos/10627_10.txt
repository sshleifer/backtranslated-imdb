So what is the real independent film? In a day and age where the latest Hollywood fad seems to be solid and sophisticated, I am sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as an independent film is usually no more than a clever marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> For this reason, we should be happy to have films like "Precise hatred." In all areas, this film refers to the contradiction of its own template (independent horror film). "Hate" is not afraid to be the same. In watching this film, you will get a real sense that Kallio (the director) did not make this film just to spray fake blood all over the place, it's in this storytelling. Good ones. You may find this movie in the horror movies section of your video store, but do not be fooled, this story also revolves around love, the good people who are pushed over the edge, this light is too far at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect a bad smear or tear, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the finer points for the types of horror / thrill, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this film, and I am sure he is proud to tell anyone that he is "Evil Dead". Bruce never attempted to paint the picture of "ash", and obviously did not participate in the "hatred" so that he could do so too. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, to all Dead Death devour anything issued by Mr. Campbell is to check out this movie anyway and find out what Mr. Callio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> I've been acting well, although nothing about this movie is the Oscar caliber (perhaps on purpose), it's good to see sympathetic shows in the horror film. Often, actors in such films do not seem to try, with "hate", as if all actors took their speeches seriously, and never resorted to the typical wars of horror films. <br /> <br /> Technically, "hate" is as competent as the film Indie gets. Editing is fast, cinema is good considering the budget, and "hate" keeps pace fast, without any crash points or bad peak fight. <br /> <br /> All in all, it may not incite hatred. We have looked at all these fake Indians with millions of dollars, but I personally do not see a problem with that. It is a film for people who care about the mediator. The people who came to Thayer broke the pockets of the ass, pulled out their nickels and dimes, and put caution on the wind and made a good film. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
