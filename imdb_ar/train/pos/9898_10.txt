My 10/10 rating is just a fun factor and you should have decided you liked "high slaughter" even before watching it. Yes, it's a typical revenge story - several years later - a dirty joke, but how can you not love some of the things they pull here? I did not expect the sight of this bathtub a million years ago. <br /> <br /> Well, so maybe we can be cynical and say that this film does not offer anything new. Well, this does not pretend. It's a kind of horror that characters may have seen in "Screeching" and has contributed to its rules on how to survive a horror film. After all, who does not like watching people suffer from doing these things? It is clear that it has acquired a kind of reactionary fanaticism, where people are punished for doing what they were defending in the 1960s. But still, you must love these things! So, with an apology without McLean, this clown did not sing to the King and Queen!
