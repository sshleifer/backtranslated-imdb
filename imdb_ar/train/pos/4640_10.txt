This is one of the best films I have seen in the past two years (I saw the premiere in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war started ...) This problem of communication between people, which causes wars, interests me for a long time, Who are boys and girls, straight and gay, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the bubble three times and it's still a surprise to me - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know, the difference between them, like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... Last time I saw her - she was with my friend, a Christian Arab, and was on Israel's Independence Day (the most symbolic I can! Sarcastic) and ... cried at the end !!! - If it is touched and not embarrassing - everyone will be touched by The Bubble!
