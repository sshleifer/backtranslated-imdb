"California" is a wonderful movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film features brilliant actors, Brad Pitt (Johnny Swedish, River Running Through, The Legend of the Full) as Gray Grays, David Duchovny (X-Files Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes) Star Trek: Next Generation, Murder: Street, and escape from Los Angeles) as Carrie Loglin, Brian's girlfriend, Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cap Fair, Watts et Gilbert Gharib) like Adele Corners, his early girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler, a liberal writer, is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Bryan and his girlfriend, Carrie decide they want to move to California, so Bryan puts a college announcement for some who want to go to California, to share the expenses on the trip. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a former deception and social policeman. He recently lost his job at the city's mirror factory, a debtor, indebted to his landlord. The early parole officer stops his visit and tells him about a job. He answers and sees the ad, later telling Adele, his girlfriend about leaving to go to California. Earley and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus station and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that the killer just killed the owner. For some time, Brian and Carrie were thinking of "Early" and "Adele," but they became friends and became friends. Carrie and Adele became true friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey to learning. Although Brian and Carrie did not know early, he fought until later in the film. Brian's question in this film about the difference between the killers and us is a very good one. Earl Gray is a social scientist who sees nothing wrong with his ways, goes down the hill later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful movie, and I give it 10/10 stars and two thumbs up. In the film, especially at the end of the film, the song "Look Up To The Sky" was liked by Indians.
