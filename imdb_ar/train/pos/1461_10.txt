The film reveals the scandalous exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - by the Chinese businessman who shares his timid and imaginary point of view, his American counterpart is shamelessly shameless, the oppressed workers who get a voice, and, of course, the crazed Americans wearing beaded necklaces Stupid in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> A glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are really angry because people who make their square necklaces get paid like $ 0.10 an hour to do it. You also have the feeling that workers may have a chance to escape from working at the bead factory, but they will probably do so when they are fed the common punishment treatment of the factory owner and / or are struggling to work 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where this necklace came from, and I did not realize how tired and hard it was. I really appreciated this film because it beautifully portrays the impact of American indulgence on something we consider relatively harmless in our society to people on the other side of the world. Male honor goes to Wal-Mart. It's simply amazing. Obviously, just the tip of the iceberg!
