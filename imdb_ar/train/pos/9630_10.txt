I've seen dirty work several times, maybe my favorite is Stan and Wales. <br /> <br /> In this place, Stan and Rysness are smokers of the chimney and get a job to clean the chimney in Mr. Nudel's house (Lucien Littlefield). While Nudel conducts crazy experiments in his laboratory, Stan and Phil cause a lot of anarchy in an attempt to clean the chimneys and cause chaos in the living room. The end is where Uls is located in a tank of special formula used by Noodles for his experiments and this transforms him into chimpanzees! The best part is where Olsen is in the chimneys and landing large amounts of bricks on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much pain from this. <br /> <br /> Dirty work is Stan and Ollie in their extremities. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
