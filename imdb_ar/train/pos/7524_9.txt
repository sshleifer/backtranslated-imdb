For the film, which is ostensibly about sex and skin, it is not his right to be as strange as he is. The story of Betty Begg, a good Christian girl from the South, was not invited by her mother to marry her until she got married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful of her age, driven by the outstanding performance of the Gretchen Mall. Her page can not reconcile the images you take (no one is allowed to touch, all that is fun and respectable) with the pornographic experiences and the supposed bad effects she has portrayed on the world around her. <br /> <br /> The page has been a source of inspiration for every artist since then, not only because she had a character to die for, but because she invested each image with an innocent sense of fun that was both uniquely exciting and simple. Such a film, in fact. A black and white film and glorious colors, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
