This offer may not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask for permission and does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombie, robot dinosaurs, car-flying, and a team of fans stealing wallet. The star of the show is not a heroine, they are perverse, pampered and fanatical. If you can not appreciate the anomalous humor it offers, it may not be right for you. Everyone should give this fair a chance at least. It combines the comic design of Sarah Silverman, Brian Bushen (comedian comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Shaw), Steve Aggie (Bobcat Goldwitz "Residency") and creative energies for Rob Drink and Dan Harmon Jack, The Monster House. It also shows the best talent in the booming Internet community, channel101.com. (If you're participating in this show, check out the "Accepted Media section" on March 1, you'll be pulled out of the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment.
