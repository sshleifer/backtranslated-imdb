I did not expect the highest level of filmmaking with Joel Schumacher directing this, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Technically, this is often derived from the saving of PRIVATE RYAN with the work of the shaky camera, the favorite clips, the film sometimes goes as if it skips a penny --- all those techniques used by Speilberg to make his film look more Realistic but in the end it was more distracted than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike RYAN, the emotional component was not very weak. The characters in this film looked like real people and the story was less crowded, and it was not covered in American science (Speilberg gets 'F' accurately.) <br /> <br /> Next to the first section of the full Kubrick metal jacket, this is the most realistic picture of the boot camp I've seen in a movie, so I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, But it is not a bad film.
