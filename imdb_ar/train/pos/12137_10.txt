How amazing this movie is! I've seen him over and over again and I've always been with him. The reason for the easy re-viewing of the film is, of course, the suspended performance of young Bet Davis. Not only does she steal every scene she has, but she is actually more beautiful and better portrayed here (not to mention that she is sexier) than in any of the films she has made so far in her home studio, Warner Brothers made by Radio RKO Pictures. She wears a very bright makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in Soho in London). Her body was very curvy when she was small. Get plenty of it in the cheap neglect you wear for the big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And, boy, it is an absolute force in this scene. Howard is a bit tense, but captures the hero's sensitivity. Francis de Young records beautiful young Sally who really loves him. The degree of Max Steiner is charming and impressive. The wonderful performance and flavor of the 1930s make this the best version of the classic novel.
