This is David Zucker's only film that does not spoil anything first of its kind. I turned 98 with Night at the Roxbury directly behind him, but I did not think that there was anything about Mary that was so enjoyable that it only mattered to the frank thing and the beans he was. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know the solid entertainment just see his reviews. In any case, I see her will not disappoint me
