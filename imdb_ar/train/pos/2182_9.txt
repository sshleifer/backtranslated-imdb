This wonderful film relies on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levent, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manon at home completely in the story that Billy Wilder seems to have provided. One may wish to learn more about how closely connected, because it is an exceptionally intelligent variation in the story of the slave / sterile servant - almost symbolic of the entertainment industry, run by the dried numskulls, but has been transformed into a vibrant world of art and play by the exploitative lower class From None and WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and cinema in the United States, it is hard not to see the basic visions of this film as prophetic.
