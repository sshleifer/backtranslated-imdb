Very few so-called "remixes" can be as good as original copies. This one crosses those borders with plane colors. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw it in the cinema at the age of nine, and I took the entire film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly calls for comparison with his counterpart in 1963. The previous film is also a fun and enjoyable film, but it is recognized as a documentary about nature more than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. However, I highly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must for animal lovers. We have wisdom old Golden Retriever, Shadow. The sharp and cynical Himalayan cat. The young, lovable American bulldog, Chans. The animals are brilliantly expressed by Don Amish, Sally Field, and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to attack the movie. There is little humor, but nothing radical. No harsh violence, except for some tense scenes involving a resounding waterfall, angry blowing, and a dark railway shaft. <br /> <br /> Hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, I was surprised to see that this movie won no prizes, not one. However, I must say that this is as good as some of the best candidates for the pictures at present.
