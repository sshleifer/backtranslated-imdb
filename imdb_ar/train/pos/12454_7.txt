"You can only do a lot when the two stars can only be seen by a member of the acting team," said magellan33. <br /> <br /> I assume, therefore, that you have never heard of "Topper". <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, which can only be seen by one member of the cast, he had a dog, as before. <br /> <br /> This was the type of program that "Not Gonna Make It" is written in everything from the first episode - it was like a arcade video game where you actually read instructions to play; no one (well, very few of us, Apparently) wants to watch his comedy program essentially a basis that actually requires the thought * of his understanding.
