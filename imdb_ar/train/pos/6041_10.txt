This is the one to watch several times. The excellent writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone who did it because they named it. Freebird made me feel comfortable and laugh at my noisy youth. The address was a great choice. Wonderful film, preparation, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker flick but it would be a shame to pigeonhole it that way. Funny for the bone, somewhat like Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you do not see the TPB at all, tell if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. sequel? It can be done. There is a lot in the world that I would like to see through their eyes.
