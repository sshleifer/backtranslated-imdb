You sit there for half an hour and you see a story, you believe it all, then you see another half hour of the story itself completely disintegrating ... and then reassemble it again. A wonderful. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary film. I do not know if there's anything else - like "saved the forbidden lie" from Andrew Garicky's film "Catching Friedman" - there was nothing. He presents, exposes, defends, reveals, and asks all about Norma Khoury, author of "Honor Lost," the bestselling and acclaimed best seller in honor crimes in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is unbelievable and what makes it wonderful The film is so extraordinary that this "recognition" of Khoury is made with Khoury's full participation. <br /> <br /> For the first part of the film, Khoury's story about the supposed crime of honor to kill a friend in Amman, the story of the book. They seem quite reasonable and reliable. <br /> <br /> Her story is then disassembled and exposed by prominent and masked individuals, such as women's rights activists in Jordan and investigative reporters there and in Australia, where Khoury has lived for some time. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the charges, with a successful lie detector test in the process. Another sector of destructive exposures - not identified here because this would reduce the value of the shock ... Then returns Khoury and faces the charges (not all, but the core issue of the book). <br /> <br /> Houdini, with round-by-the-clock in this huge battle for a swinging prize, continues to surprise after a surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of a solution. brilliant.
