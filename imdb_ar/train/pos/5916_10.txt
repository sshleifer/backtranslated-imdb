I've seen this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Good Luckin), one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I have not seen anything racist (I'm not stupid), I admit that character designs are a bit difficult and disrespectful today, but I I think it is a satire and a very urban recount of Uncle Remus' old stories that were the black American culture, which created up to the main characters and the stark nod to "The Tar Baby" and "Patch Prairie." These are not fanatical stories and they do not mind thinking, but they are cultural icons created by black Americans. I am a white woman who reads and loves these stories. I also found an interesting perspective on the time capsule on black culture in Harlem, New York in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Well to get to the fine details of this movie: This movie is a direct motion movie / animation film, which begins in direct action with a colleague named Sampson (Barry White) and Dodger (Charles Gordon) rush to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape from prison, but they are stopped by a roadblock and ends up in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy hears without hesitation his fellow Scoutman Crothers, where he begins to tell Randy the animated stories of his younger brother, Rabbit, to the large city that is rapidly rising from mystery to full rule of Harlem. As you know, for me, Bunny, Bear and Fox are copies of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. The film is an abstract image of simplified animation and live footage, and the film is a graphic and administrative satire of stereotypes prevailing in the 1970s? Racial, ethnic, and so on. <br /> <br /> So anyway, it's another good Bakshi movie. Should we sweep such films under the rug? Pretend they do not exist? Hmmm ... I think it would be a shame. I think we should watch these films full of vitality, and know what is going on at the time, to what extent we have come since.
