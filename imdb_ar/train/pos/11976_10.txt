This show is about three young girls. (DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle) kill their mother by a drunken driver, so their father calls Danny's brother-in-law Jesse and his old friend Joey. So the whole exhibition revolves around living life. Girls go through life's problems and have lessons in life. They develop batons, boyfriends, and many more. The whole show is about to go with the flow. You do not have to bear grudges you just have to let go. I think this offer is really good and I watched it enjoyable. I grew up watching this show and still watching it today. I'm glad they're still broadcasting this show on TV. I watch it almost every day. I am the rate 10/10.
