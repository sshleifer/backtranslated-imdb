As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creativity, I watched this movie on DVD without any great hope of enjoying it; in fact I was expecting to arrive in disgust at the remote control within fifteen minutes. But instead, I enjoyed this production very well, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and the director were able to tell the story of Modesty Blaise's return. They managed to avoid the trap of making a bad copy of the books we all know. Instead, they chose to focus on a period in Modest's life that was only mentioned in novels. <br /> <br /> As for the production values ​​(I am not a student in the cinema!): Yes, the film was filmed with a budget and a tight time, and it may appear ... but does it spoil the fun of the viewer? In this case I do not think so. Instead, we recognize one of the world's greatest literary heroes and give a taste to her abilities. <br /> <br /> As for the message: because in the uncommon territory, the only people who really matter are modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lopez. For me it was quite reliable. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be an exciting heroine, was brought to the Moody's screen in magnificence and subtlety; her style (when martial arts were needed) but more importantly was the embodiment of integrity that is at the heart of the Modesty Blaise . <br /> <br /> Well, so we all know that this film was produced to prove Miramax's claim to Modesty Blaise, which was manufactured quickly and at low cost, but ... I can not wait to see the next production in this series by these producers - as long as it adheres to the basic values ​​of the original stories and their descriptions!
