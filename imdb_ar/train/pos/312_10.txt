Based on a true story, this series is a jewel of its kind. A slave who becomes king by capturing the heart of the strongest man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond town of Tiguco in Brazil, the diamond leader - appointed by the King of Portugal - is appointed the absolute power. After growing up in the relative security of his home, the beautiful young man, Chika da Silva, finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town and refuses to admit that a black slave girl can be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save herself, he steals a diamond check collected by the diamond commander of the king and intends to use it to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day, however, and when the booty disappears, the diamond leader is driven away in chains, where his family has been deported and thrown in the street with only their backs on. Martin, the son of the diamond commander, swears revenge. However, Xica and other slaves are sold at auction, and Xica ends up at the house of the master sergeant, an old man who bought her just to slaughter his lust. However, to the town of Tijoko, comes the new diamond commander, Joao Fernandez elegant and cruel. Immediately shocked by the beauty of a check, he manipulated the master sergeant in selling him. Thus begins a love story, full of dangers, conspiracies and passion, between the intentional noble and the slave slave girl who rises to the day she becomes a queen. <br /> <br /> The series is filled with rich details about the age beliefs, myths, politics, fashion, etc. It is really able to attract your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny with sarcastic humor and dark, full of unexpected twists and suspense. "Chika da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the entire series on DVD.
