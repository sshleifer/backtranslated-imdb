Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not happy. That amazingly beautiful woman and talented actress. This is a difficult combination to find now days. And Jeremy Northham. I heard his name many times, but I never noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is: "Use it more." <br /> <br /> Now about the film: I saw it in one of the cemetery's bouts. I would not recommend it to anyone. It's rather complex and so mysterious. I still can not believe I have not seen the end coming. I'm not going to say what crumbles the pit film? Although to say that this spoils enough. <br /> <br /> Now I'm supposed to vote on this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actors did a good job and I loved the work of the directors (Natalie) in the past. There is not a large audience for this kind of thing, and this is also a great risk. You know what, I'll just give this work 8 reasons everyone should see. Then once again, a single point discount will always have room for improvement.
