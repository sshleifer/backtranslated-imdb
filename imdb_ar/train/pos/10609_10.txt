I saw this movie last night on the cable which is unusual. What I like most about it is that it is too low and insignificant, but deeply hearted. Henry Thomas (playing the role of the child in the E.T team) is a very cool performer (supposed to be a little talkative man). David Straithern is a fantastic crazy villain. Miraculously (since we are talking about a product in Hollywood here), the child is considered a main character, but the person who does not act or has lines, is just (and lit in it). It is interesting to note that Thomas has a mysterious relationship w. ET It was the essence of this film; The child represents the essence of a "good child". <br /> <br /> Then there is music - ah, what music !! The lyrics of Gillian Welch are wonderful and the whole result is wonderful rustic music on the hill. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome in the air. I highly recommend it.
