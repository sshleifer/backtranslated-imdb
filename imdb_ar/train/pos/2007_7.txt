My personal opinion is that this film did not have any real story to vampire John Carpenter I but I do not care I like it. John Bon Jovi (Derek) was fantastic in this film. It was really crazy for me to believe that he was the one who would never think he was a famous star. There were some bad things about this film. Like the story line, there should have been more film. There should have been a sequel to the film that followed the movie storyline and should have retained the same main characters in all three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes worn by the people and the setting they choose in Mexico. I loved how old Mexico was and not the new Mexico. With mud houses and old fashion churches. I was confused with the vampires and how they managed to walk in the churches but it was wonderful how they did not follow the Dracula vampire rules.
