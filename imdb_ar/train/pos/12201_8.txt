The Lady and Shanghai was produced in 1946 and released in 1948, and was one of Welles' big films after returning from the relative exile of Citizen Kane. This film remains dark, embracing and expressing some of the craziness of early Cold War persecution. The film is filled with the peculiar quirks of Welsh from exotic angles, fast cutting, long pans and evil lighting. The use of street music is an introduction to the stunning long opening of the Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and series in Chinatown can be seen as a source of inspiration, in many ways, to Chinatown in Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, the obsession of Wales in the art industry hurts this entire film. The conspiracy of this story is often lost behind a set of sometimes incomprehensible concepts of film techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story along with the wonderful performances by Willis, Hayworth, and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this movie a joy to watch. Orson Welles does not only drop the Irish Irishman, but torn identities like the sincere and dangerous. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Wales at that time, excelled in her usual role as a sex goddess and played a deep role and real contradictions. And finally, the strange and strange portrayal of Glenn Anders, or the legal partner of the Elsa couples, is not a classic!
