Easily the biggest horror horror film of all time. I watched this movie for the first time when I was about nine years old, and I must say that I fear hell from me. Now that I've grown up, I see this film for what it really is ... a genius. Everyone, or at least every taste, dreams of seeing a snowman walking around killing people, even if they do not recognize it. I've always found something really scary for a snowman, so of course, for the horror addicts like me, this was a real dream. Some people say this is ridiculous, or any other intelligence ... It's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Obviously anyone who gave this film a low score is so nervous that it does not rest and laughs well at stupid and cheap characters. I love this movie as it is, comedy, and even the film industry rises up and makes a terrible horror of a snowman killer (it seems impossible, unfortunately) I will hold this great horror forever near my heart.
