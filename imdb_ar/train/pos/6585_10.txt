After seeing Jeremy Britt as Christopher Holmes, no actor should ever present such a scenario to imagine that he could approach Mr. Britt's portrayal of "one of the most exciting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be nothing else. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, second but still ranked second. One can argue that Mr Rathbone's scenarios were inferior to those of Mr. Brett, and I agree. But when everything is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always be forever the only actor who will truly be Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject, and we, the public, have left to enjoy Mr. Brett's unique offerings. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
