This is an amusing look at the Bible as presented by Johnny Cash (decorated in black of course) who sings a lot and also tells a bit. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is very fun. Also note the portrayal of the blonde Jesus in this work ... For fun only, try to think of five Jewish men with blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun show for the biggest and most important story ever.
