This was the first PPV in a new WWE era like Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel. A new crop of talent is needed. All this began with Lex Luger, the former world heavyweight champion at NWA, who won the title against Yokozuna. Lex traveled all over the United States on a bus called Lex Express to inspire Americans to rally behind him in his attempt to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and restore the WWE Championship to American hands. As such, there was a lot of anticipation for this match. <br /> <br /> But every good player in PPV needs an internal card and this has some good things. <br /> <br /> Tonight, Razor Ramon started to defeat Ted DiBiase in a good game. The story that revolves around it was that DiBiase chose Ramon and offered him a job as a slave after losing a shock to a 1-2-3 child on the RAW in July. Ramon, angry, then collaborated with Team 1-2-3 against Team Mark Inc. of Money Inc. in Ted DeBiase and Irwin R. Chester. To settle their differences, they each won one match in the Debiase, Ramon and Chester matches against Kid. Razor managed to settle his side of the deal after reaching Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> After that, Steiner Brothers put WWE Tag titles on the bench against The Heavenly Bodies. They ruled out the "The Bodies" intervention, director Jim Cornett, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket and were able to win a decent match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect have been in a row since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels faced perfection after losing to Lex Luger. He then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in the title match against Martti Ganetti. Michaels won the title again and put him to the test against Mr. Perfect, but Michaels now has a strong ally in his corner in his 7-foot diesel personal guard. Michaels and Perfect were excellent here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, taking Perfect out of the ring and pitching him in the steel grades to make Sean win by counting. <br /> <br /> Irwin R criticized Shyster losing his partner in the tag team early in the night, easily representing a 1-2-3 child. <br /> <br /> Then came a big game the night when Bret Hart prepared for the Jerry Lawler match to win the title of undisputed king of the WWE. But Lawler got out of the crutches, saying he had been injured in a car accident earlier that day and arranged for him another competitor to Hart: Dunk the Clown. Hart and Dwaynek had a good game that Hart won with a shooting player. Then he jumped from behind by Lawler. WWE President Jack Tunney bought the ring that told Lawler that he would get a lifetime ban if Hart did not wrestle. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with a defender, but Hart refused to give up waiting and reversed the referee's decision. So after all, Loller was named WWE king without question. This match was followed by Ludwig Borda's destruction of Martti Gannetti in a short match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker finished his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, who began in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated a full client at Wippleman and continued to follow. When another monster Wippleman killed the Giant Gonzales Taker in the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzalez then ran Wippleman, who gave it to him after the weak game. <br /> <br /> After that, it was time for six players to participate in the tournament as both Smoking Gunns (Bart and Bylly) and Tatanka defeated the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka Samu. <br /> <br /> This leads us to the main event with Yokozuna, surrounded by Jim Cornette and Mr. Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex returned because he was able to avoid the fall of Benzai and then criticized the body of Yokozuna before expelling him from the ring. Then Luger attacked Cornet and Fuji where Yokozuna was counted. Luger had won a good game !!!!! The balloons fell off the ceiling. All the heroes came out to congratulate him on his win. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger has proved to be beaten. The only question was: Who can beat him in the ring and get that title?
