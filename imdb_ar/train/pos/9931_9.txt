I have hired a domino on a whim, and I do not even know it is inspired by a true story, although it is the least likely and real biography that you may see. I found it pretty cool. <br /> <br /> With the writing of Richard Kelly, combines a wide range of intrigues and novels into two hours of pure entertainment. Once you see him more than once you get him and appreciate him. <br /> <br /> Domino is a hunter who avoids reward and leaves Hollywood's idyllic life to pursue a career that is not very precise or perfect. She has a sour acid journey style director Tony Scott. With fast music and editing, it provides visual lighting that keeps your attention, with outstanding performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well made and enjoyable and must have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and enjoy at the same time for two hours.
