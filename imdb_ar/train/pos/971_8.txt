This film reminds us a bit of German films, the absolute story because the child is magically transferred to a strange land in order to be a hero. However, given the very distinctive modern technology, puppets and CGI are used to create a world characterized by amazing realism - a world that will blow your arms because of its realism and scope. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, but the boy was a must at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this movie is a movie that may be abandoned very quickly or rejected because everything in the film seems very strange. However, give it a chance. Do not think or try to understand everything you see - just let the story unfold and you'll probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice that I would like to give adults who see Miyazaki a deadly spirit because they are very similar and are marked by tons of Yukai (Japanese mythic spirits). The great differences between the two are that the Great War of Yokai is a living act and that its intimate spirit is more suitable for children. Although I think the great YOKAI war was mostly aimed at being a children's film, most parents in the United States do not want to show it to young children because it is violent and scary and includes some adult behaviors. So who is the audience in the West? Well, older children and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and compositions. This audience is fairly narrow, in fact! <br /> <br /> While watching, look for all the small, exotic touches. In fact, you can watch the movie dozens of times and notice different small things every time. Some of the funny references I liked were the comment about Gamera, the scene that came with the comment "KIDS: Do not try this at home" as well as using Kirin beer to allow someone to actually see Yokai (well, ... this scene should probably have also included this Warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, it is difficult to determine the director Takashi Miki stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories were "normal". Some of his films are disgusting, disturbing and disliked (especially Audition and ICHI The Killer), while some are magical films and among the best films I have ever seen (Happiness in KATAKURIS). One thing is certain, it's hard to see one of his films and not react strongly one way or the other.
