I remember seeing this movie a while ago, and after seeing 3,000 miles to Graceland, everything went back to the flood. Why has not a video or DVD been released yet? It is a sacred thing that this clown was not released in the film industry while other wastes were released. In fact this is the John Carpenter film that has not been released. In fact, I have not seen it on television since the day I saw it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely the role of a boy to play. John Carpenter's break brought horror of this gem that I love to play TV again. Acting well and performing well as far as singing goes. Seawors from most of the greatest Elvis songs with Gusto. I think this was also the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which kept them producing a number of great films (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, Escape from Los Angeles). This was done before someone re-made A new version or his own life, which I feel will not only deform the king but also destroy the charm that this person possesses. If he is not released, we will be at the Heartbreak Hotel.
