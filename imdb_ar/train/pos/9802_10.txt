For starters, I've always been a fan of Batman's cartoon because the theme is so universal that everyone is alive and elegant. This is true in the mystery of Batwoman. Although the overall story is good, I am disappointed that they did not really do much for excellence with this. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, you try to find out the identity of Batwoman, unfortunately you can find out by looking easily at the credit group posted on this site (so if you do not see it already, do not go there). I was disappointed because they did not make the film longer. 75 minutes too short for any movie. The secret identity of a beloved woman also comes too early in the film, halfway up, and becomes hostile to the climate afterward because you know that good people will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the film ends. <br /> <br /> I'm not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I like the stylish new characters but there must be more details where details are called. Some parts of an animation look so embarrassing and harsh that it immediately attracts your attention to divert your attention away from the story. I also did not like the bright atmosphere used in most scenes, he loses his sense of dark and grim Batman. Similarly, we had to learn more about the character of the beloved woman so that we could build the same deep emotional feeling that we live with Bruce Wayne. I also think the battle with Bane should have been better done. In the usual pattern of children, a bad man meets his demise very easily either by stumbling, falling, being exposed to electricity or doing something stupid that works against them. Come to think about it, there was not a single drop of blood spilled in this film too. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a flick of entertainment that anyone in Batman likes to watch. She has a good story, a global appeal and even acts very much to the top. I just wish they would be able to make a lasting change in the story by making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting. Not only show them and then kick them once they are finished. I would also like to see someone else discover the mystery of change in the end. To make some other than Batman solve the puzzle and fill it later in detail. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be more upcoming movies and look forward to the time when we will be able to see a separation between Bruce Wayne and Barbara Jordan. He was always mad at her and did not like her and I can not believe she was stupid enough to fall in love with someone over 20 years old. I also want to see when Tim Drake is leaving because he is sick of the old man. In short, I want to see all the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same repetitive formula would end sooner than if it had decided to proceed with the story. <br /> <br />
