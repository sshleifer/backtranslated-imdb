This was a scary film. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt deserves an Oscar for this. <br /> <br /> A traveling novelist (David Duchovny of X-Files fame) and his girlfriend pick up two hikers (Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt) on their way to California. <br /> <br /> On their way, they stop at the scenes of murder serial killer to film the scenes of a forthcoming book by Duchovny, who know little about the most turbulent serial killer in the history of the country. Sit directly next to them in the same car.
