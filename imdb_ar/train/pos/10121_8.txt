Although she is not as savage and a director as some of the subsequent Mickey Takeshi movies, they are a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The main story is the story of a policeman from a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to take down a Chinese gangster. Complicating matters is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complex than that with many complexities that make things interesting and distract attention from the central narrative direction. About this complexity and loss of the road about an hour in the film that makes this less than a wonderful film. (It's a very good movie) This is definitely worth watching especially if you do not mind the lack of hectic pace. <br /> <br /> A word of warning, violence when it happens explosive and bad. There are also half graphic images of gay sex. If this is not a cup of tea, proceed carefully. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
