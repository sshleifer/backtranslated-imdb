Have you ever heard a story about heroes who are reluctant to be hired by the king to slay the dragon? Oh, you have? Was it placed in a world made up of small islands floating above clouds, and did the heroes have to take dangerous steps from one island to another on their journey? Did the water flow up and the remnants of major cities fled on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> I stumbled across this film by chance and I'm really glad I did it! It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Much like Pixar, it's a computer-animated art that can only be achieved in today's world. The cartoonists have invested in thinking about almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is amazing (the scene where the mushroom sweeps the green smoke while the characters walk in the background is one of my favorite things). Monsters are also well-known and wonderful to watch while playing. <br /> <br /> Although the piece may not be completely unique, the movie has enough magic to make sure it's still watching. Our heroes are loved and delighted, ensuring that the public stands behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that may devour everything on its way. Of course, Hector is the personal that will fall in love with her. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides comic relief in a way that Dream Jar Jar Binks can only dream of. <br /> <br /> In short, I recommend watching The Dragon Hunters if you get this chance. Watch it for stunning animations and breathtaking scenes of battle in a world like nothing else you've ever seen on a movie or TV screen. At least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which I really am)!
