One of the things about the film that prepared for my heart's threads was that dry fly fishing was a big part of the scene. I sometimes made dry fishing times, having linked my flies, my two brothers and my father, to spend one day on a river or another in an attempt to seduce Trout Brown, who was always out of reach and taking the fly. Which was presented to them. <br /> <br /> When we had such occasions, any differences between us and any melting of the world's pressures disappeared to be replaced by the glory of absorption in activity and surroundings where we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most amazing things that was filmed for me in the film as a minister and his children. Norman and Paulie performed rituals. Because there is something of a ritual about fly fishing where there is a ritual about a lot of entertainment. You can not just start choosing the fishing line and hope for the best. You have to be consistent with where you are, you have to examine the surface of the water in view of how it flows, and where the best point is to fly fast, and depending on your skill level, you may get to fly there for long enough for the fish to take note of it and hit . The art of fly fishing was directed and well represented so that they could be classified as artists themselves. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie can not be chosen more appropriately, because the river has already been run through the life of the father and two sons. But this film spreads more widely from the family and community of Montana, next to the Blackfoot River, where the film is screened. It has the power to attract your attention and to receive you, because the history of the family, society and period has unfolded. The story is not just a family history, but a history of life. What can be classified as the "river of life"
