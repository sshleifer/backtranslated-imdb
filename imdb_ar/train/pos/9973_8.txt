I really liked the version of "Vanishing Point" instead of version 1971. I found the 1971 version too boring. If I can wake up in the middle of the movie several times (as I did with the 1971 version) of me, it is not wonderful. Of course, this may be due to the fact that I was only nine years old at the time of the 1971 version. However, I have seen many remakes made, where I loved the original and the older the better. I found that the 1997 version plot was more understandable and basically preserved the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version was more exciting and was not "blase". (Boring)
