This group of adults returning to the summer camp for their young people was quiet and expatriate in cinemas in the fall of 1993. I say that was a shame, but again some of the best films are quiet releases that do not get much noise or praise . <br /> <br /> Diane Lane, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin Well here) are the actors who embody these roles as people who grew up with good memories, bad and funny about the summer. This film covers feelings of feeling, which are often enjoyable, and never makes the film a scene to feel what the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to access the memories alone. Because I'm opposed to films that are blatantly shameless in movies, this is something I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic cheap rent, a good main rent and even a lovely sitting in the theater flick. You may pass through this on TV and I would definitely suggest a look.
