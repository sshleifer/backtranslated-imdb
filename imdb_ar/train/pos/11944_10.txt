I would give it 8 points, but since you got 6.5 votes out of a lot better votes, I had to raise my contribution. The Styx River was a pure genius. Certainly, Woody was his permanent purpose, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really fun, then it was easy to watch the rest of the movie. The dialog box was smart enough, and Woods papers were tricked into parties, along with the upper crust reaction, pleasant to watch. This was much better than the critics of the newspaper made it sound good. In addition, the little magician trainee to go with her. Of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting worse? Charles dancing is always amusing, as was Hugh Jackman.
