Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keep you guessing all the time about what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is wrong for the contract killer as he enters a small town in an attempt to find work. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and no one plays them better. Look for a brief appearance of Dwight Joakam. This is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
