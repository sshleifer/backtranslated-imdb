I'm not sure what to say about this film. It's one of the handful of movies I've ever made that I will consider romantic. To try to talk about the plot, performance or technical details about this film will be to express Zappa's candid "dance like architecture". It presses completely on your head exactly the way you pick up those fleeting moments in the life that drives us and then escapes us so as not to experience it again. This sounds like a movie that wanted a personal copy of Charlie Kaufman in the adaptation film that you write. The end is left open and mysterious, not happy ending here, just a puzzle. There are no deep life lessons, just a couple of peer and intelligent children who explore the ability to feel the most rational and unrealistic emotions ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 saw it with your friends a special lady and recommended it to a stranger ................
