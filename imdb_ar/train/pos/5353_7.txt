He was appointed in 2017 (although one may easily make mistakes in 1987, based on hairstyles and clothing). The Running Man believes that the good guy in all respects Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is framed for a crime he did not commit. After a daring break in prison, he was captured and entered as a racer in The Running Man, along with some of his fugitive colleagues and the beautiful female icon, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Using totalitarian rule as a means of controlling the masses, the convicted gallery digs against a group of colored dissidents (often in camps), each with its own unique style of killing: Dynamo releases electricity from a special suit, Sub Zero Ice hockey stick with razor, Fireball prefers the flame launcher to finish the competition. But these killers do not fit in with Ben Richards, who sends each of them in an outrageous way (followed by mandatory ridicule). <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, exact revenge from the host, Kylian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the world of motion pictures, and his genius, he could have done nothing wrong. The Austrian beefcake had a successful combination that ensured a box office success for its films: comic book violence, the absurd plot as well as the beautiful feminine femininity as well as the broad outlines, minus the ability to represent huge profits. The Run Man has faithfully followed this famous recipe for a crowd of T and Arnie (mostly male teenagers) who ended up (including me). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, after you've re-watched the movie for the first time in years, I find it a strange film: a film completely free of artistic merit, decent acting, and masked effects, but in a completely amusing way. Directed by a short story by Stephen King (Richard Bashman), The Run Man is a cheesy 1980's that looks cheap in a way that does not seem to be cheap. True and very dated, but despite (or perhaps because of) the soft film, it has a special charm that is hard to describe. <br /> <br /> With no attempt to create a realistic reality near the preparation of the future, the film provides a lot of unintended laughter. Check out the scene in which Ben discovers Amber's secret cache of forbidden cassettes (!); Marvels at "futuristic" crap graphics used on billboards and running game man (like a graphic designer, I found this particularly amusing); Technology. <br /> <br /> The man who runs on the field may be a complete nonsense, but he is immensely entertaining the absolute garbage that I do not hesitate to recommend to Arne fans and the science fiction movement in general.
