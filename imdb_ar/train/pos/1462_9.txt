In this documentary, we meet with Roger, the rich manager of a factory in China that manufactures beads and other ornaments sold at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims that factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities he offers, but interviews with four of them tell another story. The dark life of the girls is in stark contrast to the strange excesses of Mardi Gras herself. David Redmon, director of the American company that imports and sells the beads, should be praised for taking excellent and rare footage of everyday life in a Chinese factory complex. The film is told convincingly and serves its purpose clearly as a window on what lies behind those "made in China" signs everywhere.
