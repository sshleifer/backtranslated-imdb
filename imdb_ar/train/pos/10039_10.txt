Classic Titanic. I was really surprised that this film did not have ten clips, generally in the IMDb user ratings. Perhaps, it's great not to give the Titanic a balance at the moment, but when it was first introduced, it was really something. When the film came out people flock to the theaters. When the video appeared on my sister I was watching him twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. It was hard to forget some disaster scenes, such as a frozen child, or a man who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died aboard that ship, and the movie was moved immediately with the passion and emotional needs it needs is a difficult challenge ascended by James Cameron. Let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was or was not woven from someone's imagination, it was wonderful. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They're definitely as hell giving Romeo and Juliet away from their money. "I will not leave her, Jack." Titanic is a wonderful movie that goes back to its essence. It is a powerful story told through great acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of dedicated hard workers. It really blows when someone says he hates this movie.
