Released in France on DVD several years ago - I hope it will be republished in English translations. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets bad reviews. Gerard Philippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune-teller that he will marry the king's daughter. He set out to join the army and go to war. His love, however, is Gina Lolapr√≠gida in her early film. Will not spoil the end. Gerrard Philip died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.
