This music is definitely mixed, and none of the elements fit together, but in a way it can be fun. The plot contains some elements of the novel Wodehouse, but not its advantages, although he participated in scriptwriting. The songs, though magical, have nothing to do with this specific film, and are unusually pressured into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Both Burns and Allen perform their normal course with high efficiency, but lose the rest of the movie by about 40 intelligences. <br /> <br /> There are a few high points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that this is stopped, and stops stealing like a silent actor. There are a few parts of the writing that could have been written by Wodehouse only, although most of the film looks like the production of a Hollywood meeting that later ridiculed them.
