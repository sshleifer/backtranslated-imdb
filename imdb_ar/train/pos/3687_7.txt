Greetings back from darkness. 18 directors of 18 short essays seem to have nothing to do with love in the City of Lights. Very unusual format takes a few slices to adapt to it as a viewer. We were used to developing a character on a two-hour film. It's a simple thing to do in an 8-minute clip. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 love stories / relationships in 18 different neighborhoods of this wonderful city. Of course, some stand better than others and others go to comedy, while others focus on erotic emotion. Some very well-known directors, including The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Alexander, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha, are participating. Many familiar faces also appear: Steve Bossemi, Barbit Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Jazara, Gina Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Pinochet, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nault, Maggie Gillenhal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best sectors includes silent acting, then silent acting and a young, happy father between the two. The main roles also play a red coat, a crab, a pedicure, a sexual fantasy, a child's death and many other subjects. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The variety of slides makes it fun to watch, but as a film, it can not be considered wonderful. This is still a great perspective and a pleasant change in the frequency of frequent movie visitors.
