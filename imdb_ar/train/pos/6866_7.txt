************** Potential spoilers ********** There is only one reason to see this film was because I have a huge crush on Richard Belzer. (I do not know much about humor) there was a part that was funny like Barbie and Ken Parody and Merchants and the head of a comic play. Do you ever mind being a liar (dari, say raw?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Perhaps if they spent more time in humor and less time getting women's clothes, the film would have been more entertaining. Some short stories make you just want to cheat, while others make you laugh and think strangely. Unfortunately this film is dated. If you have a crazy crush on Richard Palzer (worth it), it's worth checking it out and seeing Chevy Chase.
