I enjoyed this movie a lot. You've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie just confirms it. She depicts a housewife in an African-American family starting from the social chain because of the success of the husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. You move into a whole white neighborhood where people are friendly, but a bit embarrassed. The various events that arise during the film make some laughter but mostly appeal to other feelings. This film is not as much comedy drama. Give it a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you take it on TV or rent it soon.
