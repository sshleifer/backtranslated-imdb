I caught this movie in a test view. I was very surprised to find a really sweet and pleasant story. She behaved well. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead was Osem. Very funny film. It takes place at the best locations in New York. It made me want to go there. I just saw "I got a mail" I thought that "you had to be you" was a much better story. The audience I saw with his love.
