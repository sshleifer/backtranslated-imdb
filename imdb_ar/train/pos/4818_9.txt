I always have a little mistrust before watching the British period because I usually find it boring and exciting film shows (for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with great production design, European landscapes and those dense British dialects that Make the films indicate the artistic value they really do not have. Fortunately, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fall into this position, and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation for his wonderful story, excellent performances by Emily Blunt, Paul Pettani and Jim Broadbent and the fashion and sites that make the film unexpectedly rich to watch. I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not notice much of this detail. <br /> <br /> "Victorian Age" was (in my humble opinion) one of the main points of contemporary civilization, not only in the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. Frankly, I did not know much about the origins of that era, and perhaps because of that, I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that prepared the decline of the modern era very much. I also liked how Queen Victoria was portrayed as a young and intelligent king whose decisions were not always good, but were at least inspired by good intentions. I have also found the romantic portrayal of Victoria and Prince Albert very enjoyable because he is also interested in a mix of intellectuals as well as in the emotions they evoke. The only failure I found in this film was that screenwriter Julian Filos used some of the cliches from romantic cinema in a love story, something that seems a little in place in his film's script. <br /> <br /> I liked The Young Victoria very much and was really surprised by a very nice surprise. I hope the long films follow the example of this film: fashion and landscapes must support an interesting story, not an alternative.
