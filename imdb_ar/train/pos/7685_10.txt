Norman Lear hit another detailing the problems African-Americans faced in the troubled 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> With Ester Roll, her husband and three children living in a towering project in Chicago with a live black majority, the show depicts what Blacks were going through with the owner (Black Agent Mr. Buckman) as well as the current prices and problems. <br /> <br /> The three children portray how people seem to be facing their problems differently - from JJ comedian Ralph Carter to their daughter, who also aspires to success. This exhibition was an ideal description of African-American life.
