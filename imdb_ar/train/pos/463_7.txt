Of course the plot and the text, especially strong casting in the film. Lots of beautiful things to see. One aspect that I particularly liked was the idea of ​​the opponent - Turturro's - his former mentor who works evil on the sidelines. It turns out that his opponent in chess - an Italian man with three pieces and a stick - is a real player and a really good chess player. Thanks to the fact that the "opponent" is in line with the plan in the end to complete the final of the tournament after her death (Lozin took a bulletin from the window - sad, but launched) by the unstable genius "widow (Emily Watson) Lucien (who worked at a later moment of clarity) is allowed to stand up because of the courage of chess master Ghent, who praises the play and describes it as wonderful.
