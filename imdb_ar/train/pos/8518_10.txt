I ran through this movie at the local video store while selling it on the annual pier. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find some animated movies for sale, I encountered this movie. I read the back of the film and I know it was God's hand at work for me to buy this movie. As you can see, I have a group of three brothers (and are soon adopted) children living with my family. Immediately, my foster children made contact with the three children who starred in the film. The film helped them understand their circumstances better. For the first time, too, the largest group of brothers (7 years old / female) decided to open up slightly to her past and the shock she suffered. She was fighting the whole cause of trust. This is the first time I see her cry. After watching the film, I asked her what it meant to adopt a child. "That means being happy," she replied. We must see families that take care of children and think about adoption. It certainly opened lines of communication with us.
