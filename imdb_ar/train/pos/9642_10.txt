The film is very realistic. Certainly, this genre does not belong to Hollywood Cinema where each line should be pronounced in an ideal manner and where each movement is accurate. Actors playing the roles of lovers perform a wonderful work representing the feelings and ideas of characters - the adventures of their daily lives. In general, the film reaches its peak in the state of depression. This is the reality of the whole story. Not everything happens the way we think it should. I can say though that the film does not end in a bad way. We watch, we learn, we experience ourselves. Perhaps this is the moral of this story.
