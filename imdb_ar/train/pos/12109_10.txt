Yaitate !! Japan is a really enjoyable show and really loved it! It was introduced in our country recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is about Azuma Kazuma who tries to realize his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the southern branch of Toyo in Pantasia and also helps his friend Tsukino Azusagawa with other bakeries (like Kawachi Kiyosuki and Kanemori Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight other skillful bakeries from many other countries, not only learning to make different kinds of bread but also learning to cook other food. It's really funny and unique because it also simulates other characters from anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan, One Piece) and famous characters from real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and it really should be seen by people of different ages.
