If you read only a summary of the plot, this film will look like a typical model of the 1930s. The story will look very intrusive, the subject matter. The strength and beauty of this film lies in the direct and ground performances of the actors. I rarely saw Jean Harlow displaying a range of emotions, floating nuances and rich on her face. If you see their faces during the wedding ceremony in the church, there is a deep depth of feeling among the main characters. Raw feelings are filmed faithfully, and that's true. The final sequence is unbearably moving: When Clark Gabel looks so much surprised and happy at his son, he lifts it up and says proudly, "Oh my son!" , I could not remember that the son of Mr. Gabel was born to him after his death. This is one of the best examples of cinema era depression.
