I am a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatles is Paul and my favorite is John. I've already known a lot about Beatles and the reality behind separation, as well as things like the John Lennon family and the Bulls Wings team. I was intrigued to see how this film would deal with the relationship between John and Paul after many years of collapse. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this film. Although the story itself is fictional, many of the references used by the musicians were very accurate. This method included how Yoko Ono will always be with John wherever he goes, and the song "Silly Love Songs" is the first song of the year and the concert on Apple Studios' roof playing music from the album "Let It Be." br /> <br /> The actors did a very good job of playing John and Paul. The dialects could have used a lot of work, but they seemed to be acting a lot as if I had read that two former Beatles were acting like. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was like. <br /> <br /> The end finally frustrated me, but the more I thought about it, the more you appreciated it, especially as that was how it really went in real life. They also feature the spectacular sitcom of "Saturday Night Live", where $ 3,000 is offered from the Beatles for performance at the show. (Compared to the $ 220 million he offered). Overall, I was not disappointed with this film. It really gives you a bigger sense of why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
