Look at this page, and it seems unacceptable to me to listen to someone walk around and brag about a real classic. Certainly, I agree to let everyone have an opinion, but to you: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be missed by any classic horror observer, and it should be seen by many unusual viewers around the world. Sure, he has lost some of the elegance and grandeur with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's no reason to admire you. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it's actually a scary movie, even to today's standards. In total, it will crawl you out of the original masses altogether, so do not criticize the classic if you do not give it a chance. Watch it, but not with a decisive position. Watch it for fun, and how it was originally intended.
