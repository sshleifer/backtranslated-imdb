One of the best musical works, Anchors Aweigh includes many memorable musical pieces, such as Kelly's Dance with Jerry Mouse, Kelly Dancing with Sharon McCannus, 7 years old, Singing Sinatra with Jose Itorbe Piano, Kathryn Grayson Singing with Iturbe Action , And much more. The Technicolor is ideal, with some innovative camera work such as a piano view from the bottom, through transparent keys and Grayson vocals, seen through another camera finder. The plot is thin, but you share the enthusiasm of Keeles and Sinatra. Sailor on vacation, they have to take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra in his aunt. To prepare him for the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get a test with Jose Iturbe. But Sinatra is young and na√Øve in this, and in his lyrics he falls in love very quickly. While trying to contact Iturbi, which is never available, begins to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly now falls in love with Grayson. Aweigh anchors are often reminded of the sequence of live animation / animation with Tom and Jerry, but there's a lot here worth watching. I give it nine stars because, although it is not as good as the best musical works - Singin 'in The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it is one of the first large technical products Technicolor (perhaps Meet Me In was St. Louis I) Others.
