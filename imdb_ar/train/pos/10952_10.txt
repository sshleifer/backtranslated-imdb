Sarah Silverman is a Dangerous Bitch! It is beautiful, exciting, funny, talented, dark and satanic. I read the other "comment" on this offer as well as the message board things and the people do not get it. Nothing shown on TV is an accident. A lot of money, time and work are saved in the production of T.V. There will be errors. This offer is stupid because Sarah wanted to be stupid. This show is an event because Sarah wanted to be events. I thought the jokes were wonderful and displayed as well as other oddly musical numbers. It is very similar to the Pee-Wee's Playhouse, which is characterized by a heterogeneous texture of glittering glue, Future Pornstars of America from The Valley. The cast is wonderful. Scenarios and good work linear. I hope this offer succeeds because Comedy Central has not invited David Spade to keep his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? It's not in the list of cast on the home page for viewing. I like to see her position. Does anyone know about the dates of presentation or DVDs you might put there?
