The first time I saw her I got half of it, but I saw it and later learned that it was about magical experiences in Salem. Focus on the Sarah Good family. SHE is famous for cursing a priest has become a fact. In the film depicts her daughter Dorcas and her husband the spirit of a pleasant husband Anne Putnam comes to the future chasing this girl to redeem her soul. Which happens at the end of the film. Dorcas is depicted as a 5-year-old magician and burns to the test. Which never happens, was rescued by Ann Putnam from the flames. The girl safely goes to Anne Putnam's grave to see that this is not empty, but at first she accuses her of witchcraft, and allows her to burn to death. Now that Putnam has saved that her soul has been replaced, she is not a pariah of the community in Salem's witch trials.
