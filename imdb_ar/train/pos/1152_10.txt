The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the commercial center to revive the weak spirit of Sally is just enough reason to enjoy this film, but wait! there is more! This is sending a good click for television during the day, movie stars are going down, (and above) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr. shows the lighter side of his genius, and Kathy Moriarty is wonderful. The dialogue is intelligent, and the physical humor is skillfully accomplished. It's a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing and writing.
