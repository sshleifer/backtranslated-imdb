"Home Room" such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant", were inspired by the recent spate of fire in schools. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on survivors (not shooters or dead) following the shooting. Make it less useful and useful because of the effort to ask questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give in to this little movie in the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to be assigned to the real story but plays like the rejected "Hill Street Blues" episode. It is lame but bear it, at least running long enough to classify the film as a feature. I recommend you skip it completely and just jump into the hospital scenes - there's nothing here you can not pick up from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like so many good little movies, this was a creative one man show while Paul F. Ryan writer and director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a particular unit of execution and execution that often lacks dramatic budget features. Since the "Home Room" script is its real power, it is fortunate that the writer also performed the production and confirmed that his vision made him on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan takes a huge opportunity with the end that tests the boundaries of emotional tolerance for ordinary viewers. Run it right up to the edge, but unlike all the logic leaves you cry instead of crawling. Why the end is a combination of the public need to reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song ("Sarah surrendered" to Sara McLaughlin) that comes out, the stunning editing of the last minute. <br /> <br /> The other force of the film is the portrayal of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as two main heroes. Although Phillips plays the role of her isolated, isolated teenager, Christensen is her smart daughter for a good family, but they bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is satisfactory and not of great importance to Ryan. What happens here revolves around two of them despite a lame story about a police detective wondering around town trying to link Alicia with a single shooter. If they re-cut and cut the film, you should intensify this story. <br /> <br /> The story of two very different girls and helping each other is hardly a new idea and Ryan can easily lead this film in cliches and predictability. But instead, their text makes them engage in the wonderful and masked sparring game, slowly cutting each other apart and sharing moments of weakness, only to pull back inside themselves. Diana's "I Die From The Inside" only rips you off - I can not think of a moment in any other movie I've felt so strongly like. She is in desperate need of communication to resist Alicia with equal desperation. Deanna progresses only when it recedes. The viewer continues to expect that the hug of the group will never happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this generates not only a lot of thrill, but also leaves you impressed with both the characters and the actors that brought them to life. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
