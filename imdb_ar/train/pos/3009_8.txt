The film represents 30 Warners in an age when each studio had a special appearance and style to take them out, unlike the day when getting the audience was the goal. <br /> <br /> Curitz was a key element. Warners House's directors worked in a tight and efficient economy, creating high-quality work methods that were the requirements of the Warners director, a studio that was one of the biggest "Big Five" of this age to produce high-quality movies for their strings Large theaters. <br /> <br /> Although we have a group of upper classes in Long Island, the overall Warners style is included here with a narrative that can be "torn from the headlines". Another example is when the photographers hang on the legs of the girls early in the film and comment that "the awards are not" gives the film a more effective man, feel good, because these are the audience that Warners was targeting in the Great Depression. (Paradoxically, both Colombia and Universal were minors under these five disciplines until the 1950s when their participation in television changed their fortunes - they could have done something very cheaply without Polish talent and great talent). The film moves at a fast pace while keeping the viewer at the corners of the camera and editing fast. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the heavens, there is no sub-schema that cares about rock love, so the fun can continue to roll.
