When I was a kid, I loved both Bill & Ted movies. On the other night, the Bogus trip was ongoing and because it was at least 5 years since the last time I saw it, I decided to adjust it. This film is still funny after all those years. "Excellent adventure" is better, but this rocks are similar. Sure, some of the masterpieces are a little cheese, but hey, this entire film is cheesy in a wonderful way. In addition to being the most wonderful character to ever die in a movie! Conclusion: Just like a dude non-fake movie! Excellent way! Station!!!
