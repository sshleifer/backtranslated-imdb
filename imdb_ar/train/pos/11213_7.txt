This second film is as interesting as the previous one, but there is no suspense. We know what to do and what will happen before hinting it on the screen. Then comes the pleasure of the way the various tricks occur and their succession. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose a wheel, and that the car will hang, just to talk about the car. This is what happens. Now the details and details are for you to discover in the movie. It is clear that some women may catch dumbbells and must come, but we know that he has already seen them and knows that he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how will you get out of it? This is what you should discover for yourself. Do not worry that it will get to the flagship store but how will it be another story. The speed boat does not match our busy beaks on the river. We also know when it will hit. They did not know what jackets were in those days. It is true recently that it has been discovered that some GIs did not have this type of equipment in Iraq. But what does this film mean? This insistence on pursuing traffickers and this blindness that does not see that the ban is creating the problem. But the film is a perfect and lasting example that there is no value to anything that can stand in the way of this moral campaign against the forces of evil. Why not simply legislate these goods so that they can be properly monitored and monitored? When something is illegal or thrown away, it is less fun to use. It is forbidden or restricted attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Colardieu, University of Paris Dauphin, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin en Evelyn
