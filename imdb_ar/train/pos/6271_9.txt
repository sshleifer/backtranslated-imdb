I liked this movie was so wonderful. She has everything: cars, shooting, fighting, and even a symbolic girl. Do not excel at any of these things, except cars. A few shoots, a little fighting, a little camouflage around him, lots of cars, with a big chase near the end. The jump is impractical, but according to our close friends here in IMDB, the film can be as bad as people draw. It has some quality, and I like to watch it. In fact, I loved the film. I did not need to stop mentally watching him. I did not always think, "Is this possible?" Or such a vagabond. 9 in 10.
