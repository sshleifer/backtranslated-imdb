I love this movie! I am biased because I admire watching Disney, but I really enjoyed myself. The work begins at the beginning of the film and continues to work! This is a bit for Disney, they do not spend too much time developing the character (my husband pointed out this) and there are no musical numbers. It's an action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes Disney, be it young or old.
