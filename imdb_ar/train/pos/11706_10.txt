For all reviewers on this page, I would say that this movie is worth watching. So it was made in 1972, so what? The fashion in the film was the same fashion at the time. People who have not studied the culture of contracts may think this is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind" (which was made for our time at the moment), it looks exhilarating. However, the only delightful part of the film is fashion, which has been over 30 years in the past. But. The message that is sent in this movie is very strong and is carefully preserved. There is a lot to say, but I refuse to say so. (For fear of spoiling it), so, watch this movie! If you do not like the message you send, then you have issues that need some attention!
