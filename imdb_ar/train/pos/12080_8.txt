Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take over as secretary of the wealthy Hughes family to get rid of her boyfriend who leaves her. Almost immediately they are anesthetized and shipped to the family farm in Cornwall. When she wakes up, she continues to tell her that she is Marion Hughes, she has suffered from mental illness and has kept her ... But why? You probably will guess the reason but you will not mind because this fun is fun. <br /> <br /> Along with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask", this is one of the best B images created. (Images B were low-budget images that were quickly prepared using low budgets and no major stars). Its length needs to be (only 65 minutes), good steering, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end that you found is not quite buyable. <br /> <br /> Foch (good actress) is ok in the foreground but Dame May Witty is fantastic and George Macready is excellent (and scary) as the bad guys. Worth catching. An ideal example of how to make a great movie with a small budget.
