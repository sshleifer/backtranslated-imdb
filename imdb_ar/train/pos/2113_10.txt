The location of the shop was located in the neighborhood precisely at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but can be anywhere. The small number of collections reflects an average European design, but it may be shop anywhere. The film is not about Budapest or about the retailing of leather goods, but about the ups and downs in love, which is reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Clara Novak are two competing partners at work but unknown. Messages to each other filled with hope, ambition and romance, the story revolves around the combination of these two sides together beautifully. Hugo Matuschik, the store owner, is having trouble with his wife, she's just a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret relationship. Elona Novodny has a great friend who buys her clothes from fur. Mr Berovic's life is centered around his wife and children. Baby Katuna plays Santa Claus for a girl on Christmas. You feel so calm Flora Ketchuk, while staying at home with her mother who dreams of someone. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. He moves effortlessly from place to place. It is one of those quiet films that look back over and over, simple but deep. The dialogue reflects the character of the speech that is not common these days. <br /> <br /> All acting is great. Even the minor characters like the waiter at the cafe and the policeman on the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Solavan play perfectly together. He was really stepping in as an actor at the time and giving a terrific performance. Margaret Solavan was a wonderful actress and under the influence of these days. Some of her other films are worth watching. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. All the Golden Stars revolve around artists. <br /> <br /> It's a poorly used phrase that does not make it as it used to be (it was a vague re-creation "I got a terrible mail) but in this case it's true. Loebach was not in a farce, but he presented a classic film of spirit, magic and warm humanity.
