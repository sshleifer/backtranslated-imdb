The "last wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a disaster film, not just an exploration of the Australian spirituality of the indigenous people, and certainly more than a simple court drama. The writer / director Peter Ware is able to move these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same exotic atmosphere that he gave to Picnic At Hanging Rock two years ago and will continue to remember for years. <br /> <br /> When counsel David Burton (Chamberlain) is summoned to defend Chris Lee (Golbilel) because of the death of an indigenous person for whom he may be directly responsible or not responsible, he finds himself struggling not only to get the truth from Me, but understand what you hear when it comes. As with the indigenous belief that there are two worlds - daily life and Dreamtime, the truth is at two very different levels, with more disastrous consequences than Burton could have imagined. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt why it is best to remember a "Hanging Rock" because of its constant ambiguity. We are on the same path, but we are forced to find answers for ourselves. In "The Last Wave", we can assemble everything with the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how much we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our natural reality. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses his budget to a large effect, gradually building a sense of torment in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound. The occasional music is unobtrusive, never try to be great. Richard Chamberlain was able to convey the embarrassment that the audience will undoubtedly feel as he tries to uncover the mystery. David Gulpilil brilliantly depicts a man stuck between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but afraid that he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put all these things together, and you have an ideal example of why David Weir is a familiar name in the cinema thirty years ago. strongly recommended.
