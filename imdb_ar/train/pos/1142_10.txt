So I started restarting HBO this month. I remember laughing loudly at the theater back in 1991 and now back in my living room. If I see it working, I have to watch it. There is no question. This is more fun for me than other more popular parody like the plane! (Which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. It quotes like "Sudden speech! Another symptom of brain fever! It can blow at any moment!" He put me on the ledge. Webby Goldberg has not been that funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field and Robert Downey Jr. all offer great performances as expected. I started giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film that was supposed to be, there was not one thing I would change or improve. So 10 is it. I have to get this on a DVD, that's all.
