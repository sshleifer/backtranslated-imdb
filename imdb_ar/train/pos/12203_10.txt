The "The Lady From Shanghai" does not have a great scenario for "Citizen Kane", for example, but the filmmaker Charles Luton Jr., the memorable pieces (such as the scene in the tub, the landscape overlooking the sea Rita Hayworth, stunning stunning blonde ("Do not Love Me", "The Great Hall of Mirrors"), the wonderful film (Everett Sloan in his greatest performance, Willis in a beautiful role, Miss Hayworth, the aforementioned wife of Wales at the time - in her most spectacular) . The plot of alien murder mystery is fun and attractive, not mysterious at all. The viewer was surprised by the twists and turns, and the line of Welles classic closure was unattractive. "Lady of Shanghai" gets four stars from this neutral judgment.
