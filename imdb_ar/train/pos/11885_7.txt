This film tells French television the tragic impact it has on a cohesive family. When Liu is diagnosed, the young man at the heart of the story as HIV-positive, declaring it to his parents, can not believe it. The film is a personal study of how this family deals with its theme. <br /> <br /> Director Christoph Honorey must be congratulated for presenting this candid account to the screen. Anywhere, but in France, this story has not been able to reach the movies because of the subject. <br /> <br /> The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the younger brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, despite the way parents want to protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Yannis Lysbart and Pierre Menard are doing a convincing job in filming the brothers.
