Gino Costa (Massimo Gerotti) is a handsome young man who arrives at a pub on the road. The beautiful and unsatisfactory young wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Kalamay) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa) meet the bar owners. He mastered his mechanical skills through some food and lodging, and had an affair with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe and rig a car accident. Their relationship becomes affected by the guilt and investigation by the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The film Nuer and the real new Lucino Visconti is wonderful. This is the first time I've seen this version of The Postman Always Rings twice. I liked the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the sexiest scenes in film history, but that's definitely better. My voice is ten.
