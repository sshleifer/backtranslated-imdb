This film was very good. The acting was great, and there were some really wonderful actors, such as Bohols and Roger Moore. This film is full of surprises. Sometimes confusing ... Yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always make you in suspense. The only thing that contains a lot of this movie is the explosion of cars.
