I was bored by the regular basic films that were circling the Christmas watch mill that I had seen over and over, and I took the chance of "The Sentinel", hoping that the juices would flow again. I've just come back from seeing a new edition of "The Castle of Darkness" entitled "The House on Haunted Hill" - complete and complete crap. Fortunately, the "Sentinel" blew me up! In an exciting story about a model moving to a creepy building in Brooklyn Heights, the film presented all I hope to find in a good film - (1) Camby characters and very exhilarating personalities, exchanges and dialogue, including funny turns by Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, Balsam as absent-minded professor - (2) terror dread! I do not give a frame away, but there are scenes in this film that drove me to the pancreas - (3) Gore is gorgeous, gorgeous makeup and an idiotic (if not very equal) direction from Michael Weiner, who flows wonderfully with this unrealistic tackles. If you like "Dead Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to confirm my love for this film - after seeing it for the first time, I dropped the jaw, prepared it and saw it again. Is now one of my favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
