I'm glad I saw this movie after seeing some other director's films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were as wonderful as the costumes and settings with the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons was treated. <br /> <br /> I agree with some other comments about the fighting scenes. It was difficult to follow them at times. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was an ethical story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers saw in the film. It's a film I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like BenQay's and Prince's "Psychological" scenes were well done. He did not come out of the cinema thinking about what just happened here. Intensive.
