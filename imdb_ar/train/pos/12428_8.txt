I enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the waste that is pumped, such as steroid that is passed as action films, God's play is simple and realistic, with believable personalities, and a movement that does not end from the top and turns into enough transformations and turns to keep you interested until the end. <br /> <br /> Good guidance, good conduct and a good story.
