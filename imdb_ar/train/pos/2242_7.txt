One feels, in part, the need to include a traditional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a film audience in 1950. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some sinister and cynical descriptions of high-level bureaucrats running the State Department --- The British are being robbed in the way that only the British can protect themselves. But then, the film loses its way into a traditional comic plot. Terry Thomas watches as usual, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely lost. <br /> <br /> A feature film, but it's not a great movie.
