The era of sexploitation began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, instead of unjustified nudity in mainstream films, and ended with the legitimization of hardcore porn. The peak years were between 1968 and 1972. Monica Gayle was one of the most beloved and talented actresses of the time, who had a small cult of fanatics. They were in fact able to act, unlike many who took the lead roles of these clicks, and subsequently proved their credit. She seems to be deliberately disappearing to the point of uncertainty when her career only takes off, further obscuring her. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; perhaps very talented for this type of sexual exploitation, and his skills, along with the presence of the screen Monica Gayle, makes Sandra, and making a woman, a fun enjoyable experience. Never pull the movie and you will not press your finger on the fast forward button.
