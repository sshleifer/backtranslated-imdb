This movie was very good if you love watching horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was good although I thought that the actress who played Julie's role could have had more passion behind her lines. Alan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing. I was on the edge of my chair all the time while my friends were scared and yelling. It was a complete success in my opinion and it had to reach the big screen. Give it two thumbs! I would definitely say that if you have not already seen it, I'll hire it. If you have seen it and did not like it, check it again because there are completely unreal parts. I also liked how many movies were filmed on campus.
