The things that will come are the scarcity of rarity, a film about ideas. Many films present a vision for the future, but few attempts to show how this future is achieved. The first part of the film, When War Comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the public was laughing at reports that the enemy planes were attacking England - the calm was at its height, Wales was predicted very soon.) The endless montage of war that ensued, , Is most effective. Illustrations strongly remind us of German expressive graphic design. William Cameron's great artistic director Menzies, and his collections of Everytown Ruins were among his best works. Margarita Scott is very seductive like the mistress of the president. The Everytown of the 21st century is a striking design. The representation in the story of the twenty-first century is not convincing - perhaps this was an inappropriate attempt to compare the technocratic rationalism of this time with barbarism in 1970. Unfortunately, the typical work, which represents angry crowds walking in high corridors, is very bad and funny could have been done Better, even with 30s technology. This is especially disturbing because the scenes of the giant plane are very convincing. This was recovered by Raymond Massie's brilliant speech that concludes the film - the ideal of scientific progress has rarely been expressed. The last question of Massey has become more important now than ever, in an age of highly manned space flight. The scene is supported by the thrilling music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whom I proudly share with his last name. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are very horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have edited a rather interesting montage of future workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD for the entire film.
