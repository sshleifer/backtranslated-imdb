Footlight Parade is one of the best comedy films of the 1930s. A cinematic text and actors, including Jimmy Cany, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Robbie Keller, make this film over the rest. Directed by the creative Busby Berkeley dance, this film will make you smile from ear to ear from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Of course, Busby is undoubtedly an indisputable master of Hollywood musical "Gold diggers in 1933" and "Street 42" returns to his score (as a dance director). Footlight Parade offers hundreds of girls wearing a comic strip, a trademark of Berkeley. The complex dance numbers were filmed with only one camera, and Busby was the first director to portray the dancers. His obsession with slender legs and "rear view" shots are clearly visible here. The overall effect is very exciting and amazing. <br /> <br /> Our son Jimmy Cagney plays the role of Christ Kent, producer of "prologues" or short musical productions that were presented in cinemas to entertain the audience before the talk is shown. He is surrounded by crooked partners, corporate spy and his girlfriend who digs gold. Although Kane had a solid background in Vodafone, this was his first film showing his talent for dancing. Joan Blondell is unforgettable as the wise, beloved minister of Kenny. Ruby Keller is adorable, as always. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film comes with three wonderful production numbers, Honeymoon Hotel, The Waterfall and Shanghai Lille, each of which is a masterpiece and is not likely to be repeated in Hollywood today where the so-called "Special Effects" replaces creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Synopsis Claudia Core: Smart and exciting, with some of the best music production numbers that you put on celluloid. Very enjoyable recession era romp.
