No doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best sci-fi films, and Terry Gilliam is no stranger to capturing such a film originality. A film surrounds you perfectly, 12 films from MONKEYS never allow you to guess at all. The good use of the Philadelphia regions and the netherworld groups creates a Gothic sense of tragedy and two people are caught in time at the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes from his masculine image and depicts a real person pretending to be himself. He is really sane, but the people of the future (or those present if you like) will hate the head of this very bad man during travel over time, no wonder he is slimming. Is sent to World War I after sending Bing to the wrong year to see how the army of the twelve monkeys pull civilization as we know it. Now that they are right and what is truly a great performance scenario, we see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt's disastrous reference for 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stu is sensual and solid as the risk shrinks which slowly begins to realize that Willis may not be cracked as it seems. The captive element of their relationship with Willis is their sense of "seeing" each other before, in another place or time. 12 Monkees is essentially about the time and madness that is flooded by the futuristic people in it and the times of the present, when the killers and the intellectual geniuses can change the world. <br /> <br /> The city of Philadelphia that embraces the dark city Gothic background to Willis's plight to complete his mission that, against all the usual Hollywood stereotypes, is not to save the world. It collects information. The film also plays the viewer, where Willis puts in a new place at the pin point. This must be a very difficult picture but it seems that Gillam is the master of the filmmaking industry. It even falls in some humor that reminds us of other great works such as BIME BITITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the painting of this man and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its future potential in the mainstream of films with a huge budget. If you want true madness and a cynical tragedy, see 12 of the monkeys. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9 out of 10
