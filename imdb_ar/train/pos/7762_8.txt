In the biography of her autobiography, Lauren Bacal revealed that Bugi told her that she should not produce such failed films like this one or something like that. At the time, Douglas Cirque was classified as "naked women", in fact, restored at least in favor of Europe, after he stopped production. When the pictures were written on the wind, Sirk had only three films for her work: Angels Angels, Time for Love and Time for Death, IMHO Masterpiece, and finally The Tradition of Life (1960), then there was silence. In fact the figures of Bacall and Hudson do not matter circus. It is very straight, very virtuous. Dorothy Malone - who was a substitute for the former German star visited by Linder - and her brother Robert Stack were the main focus of the plot. It was built continuously, where most of the film was long memories. The instability of the brother and sister, from a family of rich Texan oil owners, stands out in the foreground through luxury clothes and failed cars that arrive at full speed in a landscaped shop. Malone's transformation at the end of the film is startling: a suit and a knot, and a small instrument: ready for life, and taming the revolutionaries. Now alone, she lost the Hudson (but in any case, was not in love with her). After this three years, in the "tradition of life", Sarah Jane (Susan) will be blamed for Conner for not knowing her place.
