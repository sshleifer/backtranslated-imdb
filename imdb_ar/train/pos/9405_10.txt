While Hollywood stagnated during the few years after World War II, England developed a film industry that was prolific. In "The Man in the White Skirt", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other companies are now likely to stop working! How can Sydney handle this and maintain its dignity? This is an example of one of the great films in which Alec Guinness starred before he became Obi Wan Kenobi. It is a good look at the total messiness of the business world. If you are planning to start any kind of business, you may want to consider watching this movie.
