* First, although many say it's the worst in the series, I do not think it's true, since this set perfectly reflects the teen mentality of the 21st century. It brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of a good teenager at the times you want. Enjoy the same fun as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it's a teen movie but comedy movies these days are not supposed to be for teenagers? ... Cinemas are mostly a place for teenagers to hang around; in addition, watching such a movie while sleeping or something like that is very useful for a very enjoyable time. <br /> <br /> Many comment on the amount of nudity in this film. Well ... let's really ... do not reflect the ideas of teenage youth like the ideas of the film? What do you want to see ... smart books, romantic things? This is not at all what will be in the minds of these teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * In conclusion, I think that if you are a teenager, you should see the movie completely, and even if you grow up a real man or woman, you should see what If you still have a teenager's mind or you often think about how a teenager was, or things like that. Thanks for reading!
