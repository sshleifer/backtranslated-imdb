This film really awakened me, and he awakes to the main masculine figure of this courageously different film about his slumber in his life. <br /> <br /> This man leads John (Ben Chaplin) the modest safe life of a bank teller. A small English city, until Nadia Kidman's brilliant, stunning, wonderful and amazing engagement, which she e-mailed from Russia, began his life to become his beloved wife, according to Jones's plan. However the bug arrives - Nadia does not speak the word Jones. Despite the calm and passion of the outside, John has become so interested in a beautiful club that, instead of using a full recovery policy for the match service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What's going on from here on in the plot really shakes John from his slumber from a safe, well-paid author of an influential decision-making personality, giving the viewer an initial message that "may have acted similarly." <br /> <br /> Kidman, Kassel and Kosovitz make an excellent team that acts in Russian and is almost indistinguishable from the real thing, "almost" only because of the slight accent found in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to impress a Russian citizen with the hard work done to get The correct sound words. Nicole Kidman demonstrates her talent again by playing a completely different character from previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is fast and attractive, and you're definitely not ready to finish watching when the end titles appear, you feel you are in the middle of the plot, leaving you wanting to see the sequel once it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to get out and get this movie right away and watch it and enjoy it. Bottom line, it contains an unusual plot, great representation, and ideas under the surface. Such as the idea of ​​"brazen awakening" from the routine industrial safe life of a wheel in the community machine, the life that the members of the fighting club were so keen to leave and the machine that Pink Floyd sings ("Welcome to the machine!") I bet that in the end John was scared From Sofia on his way to the unknown not to meet her at all. <br /> <br /> Thank you, dear writers, for the great story, and everyone else has a wonderful movie, please submit a sequel! You can view it anywhere and name it anywhere, Because the originality of the place has nothing to do with 99.9999 per cent of potential viewers, I'm sure.
