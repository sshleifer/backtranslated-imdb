"8 simple rules ... to the history of my teenage daughter," in my opinion, is a classic ABC absolute! I'm not sure I have not seen each episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident occurred. I always laughed at it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Speed ​​were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the first man. If you ask me, his sudden puffs were very tragic. Everyone was always doing well, the production design was amazing, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some networks will send them back to broadcasters.
