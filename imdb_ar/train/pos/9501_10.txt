I saw this movie when it was released, when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly remember the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escaped every time when she ran into danger :) The best feature in the film was filming the villain! I think that many of the films of the alleged movement copied a lot of "scenes of escape" from this film !! I'm not just impressed when I see such copies, but it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors behaved superbly. The slow and realistic evolution of chemistry B / W hero and heroine was very natural and great images. When we were children, we felt that the love he developed was very natural: the way they face and overcome all their experiences and their plight together is something that can even make children realize the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that everyone see this movie when given a chance !! - Vijay.
