Just the kind of movies I love. Some British actors are very good as well as one Sharon Stone. Katharine Tramel (Stone) works brilliantly with an educated group of people's lives and plays on her fragility to gather experiences to write the mystery book of murder. She plays the role of female psychiatrist well while using her abundant sexual attractiveness to portray what could eventually be considered a black widow. Tramell uses dark places within society and freely participates in the hearts of Sasmian clashes in "the city you never visit after dark." From the beginning, there is nothing less than the R rating here from the dialog box alone. Stone can also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, a deadly emotional emotional woman without a meal plan.
