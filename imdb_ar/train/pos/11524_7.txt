It's a weird little movie, and I have to agree that there is some strange representation in it. <br /> <br /> It follows the adventures of a young man who decides he wants to become a celebrity Las Vegas imaginative, partly related to following his dream, partly from the dreams of others, and everything about the hardships of Chopiz. I thought the film was charming and had a moment or two of true magic that makes everything worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is as wonderful as a magician who has never been, and directing him to Max is funny and touching. <br /> <br /> Not everyone, probably, but if you like films about the trip, I think you'll like it.
