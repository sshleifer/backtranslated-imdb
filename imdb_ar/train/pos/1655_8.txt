Mendez and Marshall have provided us with a serious, powerful and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that has arisen in Puerto Rico 108 years ago. A beautiful island with the most generous people I met, and because our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, the Puerto Ricans are allowed to slay and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis of the colonial status of Puerto Rico has been created, if it has undermined families, and the fundamental institutions that support any society. Corruption is rampant to the point where people do not pay taxes (which has led to a financial crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and mistrust permeates the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the grant allowed this painful after a powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> Must see. . .
