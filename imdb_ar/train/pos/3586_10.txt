I saw this for the first time when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. I saw it again today and it still has a big impact on me. "She Fought Alone" is about a girl named Keithlin (played by Tiffany Thessen) and raped by Jas (played by David Lipper), a classmate who enjoys hurting girls. Keatlin is in a popular high school caste, but when she is revealed to have been raped, the group turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Bryan Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film tells Keatlin's struggle against an entire town. , Including a high school that allows athletes to define the social environment in a fundamental way, allowing them to escape as they wish. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best performers, and there is real chemistry between the two of them throughout the entire film. All actors in this film, inspired by the actual events, did a wonderful job. The film "A Lonely Killer" is really the essence of being in high school (at least in 1995), and being self-esteem and reputation. Recommended. 10/10
