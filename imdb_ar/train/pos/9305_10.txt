This is a wonderful work of its own and has nothing to do with anything before or after it. Brat Pack is not exclusive of the biscuits you have chosen, but in this lawless world, you create a tempting atmosphere. The film is full of "Our Men", the distinguished actors who characterize this work with winning performances. Dialogue is joy. In fact it's a new vernacular. One of the few films that can be seen again and again with deep appreciation. <br /> <br /> The highlights include the British nobility of Billy Idol, the Ben-London imitation copper, the Kyle scroll, and the survey of custom philosophies.
