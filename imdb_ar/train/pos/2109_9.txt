I passed this several times because I thought it was a stupid, painful romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, maybe a little dated. However, it is not overly emotional, as with the subjects of office policy, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, not everything as expected. But, there is enough intelligence and charm to touch the most ironic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, think carefully about how much you want to know it.
