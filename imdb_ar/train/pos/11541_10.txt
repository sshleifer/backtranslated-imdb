Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this - everyone else in the movie is also wonderful. The dialogue is excellent and very wonderful - and the scene where Lemon's character tries to get rid of the sinuses in a restaurant makes me laugh on the ground every time I see her. Anyone who happened to see the sequel is not great should not be away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. The fact that Jack Limon plays his character straight forward with tragic tones adds only to the hilarious in my opinion. These two great characters made a series of movies together, but this film is the best - no doubt.
