"Fido" is commendable because it took a tired sort of zombie and turned it into an original film experience. The atmosphere of the early fifties is amazing, acting wonderfully, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer immersed in the world of beautiful classic cars, the "Eisenhower era" dress, Art Deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss "Fido" as a cartoon-like mess, like "Tank Girl," but the two films are quite different. "Fido has a structure, a scenario that tells a story, and acts superior." Do not worry, this is a bold black comedy that succeeds where many others fail.
