This Oscar-winning film can be rated among the greatest of this genre. Tell me completely without dialogue, it is a visual expression of a boy buys a goldfish, lovingly puts it in a pot and then goes to school, leaving the goldfish unprotected and an open window carelessly. After a while, the nearby orange grove flows through the window and slowly moves toward the bowl. It seems that the fish knows something that is happening and becomes very excited. When the cat approaches the container, the fish jumps. The cat catches the fish and drops it in the container and comes out of the window where he entered as the boy who did not know what happened. This was filmed with amazing real animals. How to make Cousteau these animals behave this way is remarkable. I only wish this film was now available to people to see; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it remained memorable.
