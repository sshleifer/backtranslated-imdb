Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever. This film achieves what all great movies seek: creating a world and a time we want to re-visit them and happy to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this movie raises my soul and makes me laugh (and this is still true after many shows - always new). <br /> <br /> All actors are at their best. The profiles have died and her characters converge together so that the actor forgets (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). ("Agae", "The Complete Dwarf Pack"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek Choir" - "But Time Does not Exist"), Durning ("Something Can" We're starting from New Jersey "), Schlhoob, Wiley (Robbins coach and fellow service station), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many of Eisenhower's comedy films?). <br /> <br /> Do not miss this neglected treasure.
