I will never forget this film or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It seems just too tragic but must be said. Powers Boothe offers leading performance as Commander Rev. Jim Jones from Mystery to Total Madness. They would have won the Academy Award easily if they were released in theaters. It is a mini-series type that will not be forgotten. You will not forget the images of the brutality of the community and its control and obsession. Its rise and fall and the threat of the outside world to destroy what it considered paradise. Mass suicide is horrific, almost unrealistic for anyone's imagination about why many people (900+) go voluntarily or resist John's orders. They no longer make such a small series, leaving our mouths open and hungry to see what happened to others.
