Who said that horror was not a kind of educational films, huh? Thanks to this wonderful short film of Hammer, I now know at least not to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my house, because it may be dormant and this group will give him the ability to control ideas and mind forever! Thank you Hammer! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another episode I was looking forward to seeing, because the man on the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the finest filmmakers in Britain but still ridiculed. Sharp was responsible for some of Hammer's great films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some independent productions, such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to "House of Horror" is one of the best contests in the series, with a complex and fascinating outline that revolves around mysterious and exhilarating themes. The plot is centered on two antique dealers who stumble upon a mirror-like object, but in fact an old screaming machine that can be used to summon Choronzhon, a demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is strongly desired by Satanic worship because she needs it for their ceremony, but Michael avoids selling it before knowing the true value of the device. When he picks up a full-fledged girl who evades worship to avoid sacrificing her, Michael is drawn deeper into a mysterious conspiracy. The satanic cults and the physical sacrifice of young women are typical British horror themes, but David Fisher's scenario is never boring and offers many stylish plots, including a very innovative climax. There is also a lot of impressive tension, brilliant dialogues and fantastic acting performances (especially John Carson as a truly strange worship leader). Recommended!
