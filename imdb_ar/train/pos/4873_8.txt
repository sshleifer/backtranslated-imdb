For those who are not familiar with the subject that Kostorica continues to explore intermittently in his films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible for you to understand his stories. This continuing theme, expressed through fantasy and obscene comedy as a tool, is the theme chosen by Kosturica for a mandate. Since his brilliant work and Magnum Opus "Underground", Kusturica "Black Cat White Cat", "Life is a Miracle" and, more recently, "Promise Me This" highlights his peculiar style in the Balkan culture, its contradictory reach and the assault on the traditional term. In the case of "Promise Me This", the contrasting world of the city (urban space) and village space (the traditional term) contrasts. The city's world reflects the Western qualities that have acquired the spatial and temporal environment. Organized crime, sexual exploitation, intermittent sense of identity and extreme disregard for traditional values ​​- as expressed towards the young child - a villager. The end of the film also embodies this idea, where we observe a funeral and a wedding on a dirt road in one direction. They are on a rough collision. It is fitting that the wedding, which represents the lifeblood and the pulse of the village, any traditional values, is about to clash with funeral attendants, indicating the death of traditions in this context. However, Kostorica examines this subject brilliantly through his unique and stylistic personality. With his obscene and mysterious style as a way of filming.
