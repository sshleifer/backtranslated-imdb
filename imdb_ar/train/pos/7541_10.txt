This film from Showtime really deserves better viewer views than 4.5. I gave it 10 based on the story and the action of the two stars. After reading the viewer's comments, I was surprised by the number of people who expected this film to be a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb lists them as comedy / drama within genre. This is definitely misleading, is not it? Fortunately, I watched the movie before signing in to this site, so I did not have this expectation. In fact, based on a summary of what I heard, I just expected to be just a drama. I wonder if the disappointment in this funny film caused a lot of low voices. <br /> <br /> Another factor that may have caused the low votes is that this is a "character-driven" film. "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another character-driven film that comes to mind to comment someone who previously complained of a boring experience. Tom's work (Danny Glover) seemed to distract attention from the real plot of the film. That is, how he designed the ascending social climb of his family - or his personal forces, so to speak. However, they have worked to prove the credibility and justification of his right to move to Greenwich and move "up" in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession has become forced. He has proved that he will not stop at anything to join the White Quarter. His anger when another black person moved next door was not because of the color of the skin. It was because of everything represented by the "interloper"; all that Tom left behind. In essence, Tom became a cookie Oreo: black from the outside but white from the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are among the most written and directed minutes and actress (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened in the neighborhood (you do not want to give up). Verbatim climax and Whoopi delivers it. It's still unclear whether the conversation is when Tom's total college will go to Tom - or when you publish it, all in the middle of the night and wake up Tom. However, the opening is great. You know that life on this street will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of personality-based flick: People go through problems, some pain, dance, grow, change, and life goes on. As an audience member, I may learn something or inspire me.
