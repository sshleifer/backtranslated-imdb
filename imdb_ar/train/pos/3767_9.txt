Go back to page 10 of this review section and work your way back up. I will wait. <br /> <br /> Have you finished? Well, you probably noticed the same direction I have. You can talk all day about lame jokes, dated dates and clearly derived plot points, and get lost in "Bogus", but it seems that this movie is one of those who "hate me now, adore me later." <br /> <br /> The biggest problem Bill and Ted face is that the original text captured the 80-year-olds who followed the trends and considered themselves at the forefront of fashion, which was good for the original but was clearly blown up in 1991 when there was no slasher Does not respect himself. He will be arrested dead wearing nothing but flannel or confessing that he loved anything about the 1980s, and as Ted said: "Friend, this is a very deep hole ... Do you want to play 20 questions?" The nostalgia goes to 20 years, and that seems to be the case. Here in 2010, those who used Cindi Lauper and Megadeth began to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that (like that or not) made us who we were. If you are one of those who look at 'Bogus' as if it were an old rehabilitation process ("Fa gs!"), Then you miss this point, and maybe spent six years growing facial hair, wearing a flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed. <br /> <br /> In reference to her own origins (the Star Trek episode and the time to travel with the phone booth), B & T does not try to hide the love of its creators for the honor of Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I'm not saying that "false" is "love Real ", but I think it should be appreciated what it is: an interesting snapshot of our society at some time before the child's psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking ads, terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media that promote fear. <br /> <br /> So, To all of you, you hate the B & T there ... Stop playing the Screaming Trees CD and get this hair out of your face, go to the beach and relax ... Narcissistic depression and ennui intellectual are the SO.
