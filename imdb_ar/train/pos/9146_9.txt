This stunning music contains more than a whiff of selfishness from the star, the musical genius is the prince. The film is about 90 minutes long, but it is really easy to see why it is a classic cult. <br /> <br /> Much like other movies revolving around a young musician who tries to be great, this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to musical numbers. Although this film is not as good as 8 miles as a modern example, this series is no less, and the best soundtrack. On the dramatic side of things, the story revolves around Kid (Prince), a young artist and regular site at the club. The club owner is frustrated by the child's arrogance and little knows the child can be fired soon and replaced by a competitor. One of them suffers from a problem, where his father violently ill-treated her. During the film, the child learns some lessons in life, and learns to appreciate his friends more. It's all the things we saw at the beginning of the dramas of course, but this is combined as a musical, highly embellished. Good cast. Prince is actually very good on the dramatic side, when not be hit. He seems human and relatable. Clarence Williams is very good like an abusive father too. Appollonia Kotero first made an interesting skill at Princes. <br /> <br /> However, the main force of the film is brilliant soundtrack. Music numbers are organized well and electrically. There is no doubt that the Prince is the musical maestro, though very eccentric. When he is a great inspiration, on the other hand, he often performs songs only for his own taste, and sometimes the shooting fails, but this is true of many geniuses. The soundtrack to this movie is excellent although Sexshooter is only a weak point. The outstanding performance of Purple Rain is the forerunner. It's one of my favorite songs ever. *** <br /> <br />
