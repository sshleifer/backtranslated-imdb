Being a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this film, but I knew there was no good way like the original. I know that many Disney fans are worried about live videos, since I have mixed feelings among them as well. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1,, I tried to know what I had had a point of view about this movie. Will I be so loyal to The Lion King that I will see certain scenes, or will I accept this film just another look at The Lion King? Most of the time, I found myself accepting the latter. <br /> <br /> Lion King 1 certainly has its nice and funny moments. Timon and Bumba stole the show in the first film and certainly won a film around him. People only love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include the Timon & Pumbaa montage, which takes care of the Simba youth, and a surprising end to show some of the most impressive models. <br /> <br /> I could have done without a lot of acidic jokes, like the real reason everyone bowed to the Simba kid at the beginning of Lion King 1. I think these types of jokes are for the younger group (which is ultimately the target audience. I do not think many children really care about Disney's profit margin directly - to videos.) <br /> <br /> However, I will say that I was somewhat annoyed when they linked directly to scenes from the original film to this film. I'm only familiar with the original version that holds those scenes just like the painful thumb. There may be something different from music or sounds that will only distract me. <br /> <br /> For music, it was not so bad, but do not expect any of the classics to come from this movie. At least, LK2 had a nice song, "Love Will Find a Way". For audio work, it has been well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have done a great job as always, and even new cast members, classic comedian Jerry Stellar and Julie Cavner (known as Marg Simpson) have done a great job too. You can even enjoy these wonderful audio talents by reviewing Safari Virtual on Disk 2 of the DVD. This feature is definitely a lot of fun !! <br /> <br /> So, in general, The Lion King 1 ليس is not an ideal film, but it's nice and fun. I think many of Lion King's fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun and exciting look at Lion King's masterpiece from the perspective of our friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating is: 7/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B (good)
