This is easily 9. Michelle Serraul, better known for comic roles in the first part of his acting career, is doing a stunning, even shocking, act of disturbing the character of Dr. Petitou, the murderer of a legendary French series. <br /> <br /> It's just a believable at every moment in the film, so that the actor disappears completely behind the character - only the best is to achieve this feat, and when they do so be in a handful of parts at best. <br /> <br /> The full story (a real story in France in the 20th century) is very powerful, very evil - it produces a very powerful film that one remembers for a long time.
