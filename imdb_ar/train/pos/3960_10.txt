According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is rather difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously, as most of his films are shot on a very limited budget. Almost no dollars at all. But it is interesting to prove that Mats Helg eventually completes something that can be called action film. The task of ninja - I think - is the best of all the movies I've made. Some special effects are very enjoyable. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. It's the movie "Z" - but it's "Z" is fun and fun!
