LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I will be better this year. This beautiful tragedy of the Belgian director Benoit Marej is located in the industrial estates in Wallonia. Beno Pot Poelvoorde plays the father who desperately wants his son to win a car (Lada!). To do this, the son must break open doors. What the father really wants is that his son be a person, because he himself did not make him more than that as a local news reporter for a newspaper called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works as planned. It is best to compare this film with the DRIFTING songs of Aki Kaurismäki, although it is more dramatic and humor darker. Just as in this film, the tone is more sad than depression and the optimistic end, without being unrealistically happy. Humor is ridiculous, without making the plot unreasonable, and Mariage finds amazing images in grim settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the representation of Boylfordy. This actor was famous for his superb classic cult, C'EST ARRIVÉ PRSS DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charming killer Ben. Since then, he has played only two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his acting abilities and all the roles he played were represented by Ben's characters upon his return to a leading role in the LCA, No doubt about his actions anymore. He is simply as smart as a stupid and evil man enough to put his family in misery, but he is clever enough to realize what he has done and to be remorseful about it. Must see.
