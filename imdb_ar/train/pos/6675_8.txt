The output from this film was great for the comedy. It seems that many scenes have come out of a comic book and darker (visually - not wise) than I expected. It is recognized that this film may not be the most extreme film ever produced, especially if you are a very charming sex joke because it contains very little of it (compared to other movies like Something About Mary or American Pie). While re-watching, many jokes emerge and become more entertaining. If you've ever read a comic book or watched a movie like Batman, X-Men, etc., you'll probably enjoy the humor that goes on throughout the film. If you do not like it, you might like the respectful irony of this film. If you like this movie, the DVD has some great additions. (8/10)
