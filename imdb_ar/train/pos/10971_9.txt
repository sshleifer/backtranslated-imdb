Gray Gardens is awesome, entertaining, sad and intriguing. I watched in amazement while Eads Jr. and the father struggled and performed while remembering their past. Their presence in a dilapidated palace (not left for more than fifteen years) is a comedy and a tragedy. This film will never forget it.
