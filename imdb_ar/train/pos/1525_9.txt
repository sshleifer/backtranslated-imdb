After seeing the copy of Peter O'Toole recently, I was ready to marvel at the smart writing in this release. Spend little time fighting, which I prefer. Instead, we have shown all the many motivations behind the French and British politicians and pastors (those who have been held in Normandy) who killed them. Even the worst of all hypocrites, the bishop, leaves us with the thought that "Of course, she was innocent, the innocents always suffering from the ambitions of the mighty, she had no idea what she was saying, she had no idea of ​​the consequences of blasphemy or going against the church. The Church's position on such things even if it is not studied. "<br /> <br /> Bremer was true to the myths surrounding her death. Preview on the tape that showed the flames up and burn them. why? They used the gas planes in the film, and two of them were stopped. Suddenly, the air pressure burst in stoppage time and the flames caught fire. Fortunately for her, they did not have to repeat the shot because it was very realistic: I was burned !! A very shocking introduction to a girl from Iowa to her new career in acting. <br /> <br /> John Gilgod has performed wonderfully. He is the English politician who organizes the show. It also shows that once you condemn someone to death, you do not want to be present to watch death. You may shrink from your "duty" next time ... and not that these appetizing dishes disturb the spirit of our potential boss. We Christians, even the most anti-Semites, have no problem with the Old Testament when it comes to the death penalty, although it has been overtaken by the words of Jesus. Bring public executions such a small girl. The smell of burning flesh may bring us respectful to the senses of our souls. <br /> <br /> The only choice I have about this film is that we did not show why the priest who strongly urges it to burn suddenly becomes contradictory, even to the point of madness. There should have been more expansion of his personality, more dialogue - because the sudden "access to his senses" makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Whether Graham Green does it intentionally or not, Joan is a small self-assured gambler, you are almost but not quite, pleased to meet her. When she refused to live in prison, for some reason she thought of Ann Sexton, the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of "stealing her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing that such action guarantees immortality. You have to wonder !! <br /> <br /> If there is ever a good example of manic thought and narrow logic compartments, this is one. St. John should have transformed Buddhism and calmed down "her voices in her mind."
