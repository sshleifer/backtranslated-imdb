This film is a very interesting film about horror (like stories from the basement) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's a good fun for horror lovers and has an excellent team. The film must also be seen to see Doctor Who fans because John Pertoy (the third doctor) plays a wonderful role as a terrible and hateful star.
