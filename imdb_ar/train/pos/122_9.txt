I began to lose my faith in the films that Hollywood movies have been flooded with. Story lines fail, and the camera's work is copied from the last movie of similar taste. But, then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renovated. Not only is the fairy tale magical but the use of color, white and black visually stimulated. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you on a quick journey every step of the way and takes you to Europa 1945. We have all seen death put on the screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how every slow-moving moment takes you to death. Unlike many movies, it is not cut after one second of a show (eg) a knife but it forces you to watch the devastating and sensual beauty of the last moments of the man. I think we can all take something different from what this film is trying to say, but it's certainly worth the time to know what it really means. I would like to talk more deeply about the film to anyone who wants to send me an email. enjoy it!
