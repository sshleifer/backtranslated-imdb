I liked this movie since it started in 1981! I've lost the number of times I've seen it! He never fails to make me laugh or cheer if I feel frustrated. The three performances are wonderful and the script invaluable, in addition to how you do not feel nostalgic to hear the theme song? I think I'm quoting this film without realizing it. I know the whole script basically, so when someone watches for the first time, I should go back and say something funny about the next line. I can not even narrow it down, although Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable characters. The famous fame "I'll wake up the media" when Arthur announces his intention to bathe is still priceless, but the list does not really end. The scene in Arthur's house soon to be his father's fiance screaming, especially his interactions with Moss. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
