I fell in love with this silent drama. Kurt Russell and Kurt Russell only could have played this well. Todd (Kurt Russell) grew up from his childhood until he knew nothing but war and fighting, on the planet after the genetically engineered soldiers were obsolete. <br /> <br /> The theater and other classic icon of the movement films were created - Soldier. Neither Rambo, nor Schwarzenegger, nor Bruce Willis, nor Mel Gibson, nor Jason Statham - Kurt Russell is the one who owns this role and made it full - original, bold, and all human too. I miss the fact that the cascade was never made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
