It's not well shot, well written or well behaved, but it must be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Each individual detector is well timed so that you have to watch the next loop for any type of closure. They even slowed down the presentation by revealing only a tiny amount of information per episode, but they seemed to have just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some representation is just awful and some of the brutally brutal duologue. Some characters are very two dimensional. The most experienced actors such as Luke and Ecko really stand out for the actors who play with Jack, Kate, Said and so on. The evolution of the presentation can be very frustrating because the next loop may not show what the previous episode is doing. The annoying side plots became part of the story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season has evolved to the point where the background stories reveal more about the island than in the past. All in all in a fantastic view but not perfect.
