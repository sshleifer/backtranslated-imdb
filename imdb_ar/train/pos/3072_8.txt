Panic is a sneaky little jewel for a film - you think you've just discovered it in the first half hour to realize, with great pleasure, that Henry Bromel is a much better writer / director. <br /> <br /> The film builds slowly, with a devastating scene one after the other, pleased by William H. We have long seen David Dorfman, Messi's son, who delivers his lines as if they were completely unwritten thoughts being created in his mind. Rich and useful, this movie will stay with you for a long time after credits expire.
