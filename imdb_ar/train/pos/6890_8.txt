This was one of the highlights of ST: TNG in the second season, which can not be forgotten, before they grew up or grew up in the third season and beyond. This was not just a show up and foreigners like Bill Campbell and Terry Hatter, but he was also continuing to discuss data on his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> In a side note, I still feel disappointed that there is no balance for the actress whose character O'Conna was about to get an experience (after the character of Terry Hatter) before being brazenly stopped by the lieutenant. I remember watching this episode "for the first time" in my comic shop friends again a day, and we all thought it would be Jan Jean's Ideal / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful lady is actually ...
