I'm sure most people already know the story - the scorned Ebenezer Scroog gets a visit from three spirits (last and present Christmas ghosts and return) that highlights parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and changing his ways. Dickens' classic story has somehow stood the test of time to become a favorite for a happy holiday. <br /> <br /> As I grew up watching the 1951 version of Alastair Sims, and I think it is the final Scrooge, I was impressed by this release, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays the role of Ebenezer Scrooge convincingly, actors who play ghosts are scared and somewhat intimidated. David Warner is one of the best versions of Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version was beautifully filmed and uses more modern imagery (1980), making it more acceptable to my children than the 1951 Black and White version. <br /> <br /> This is a suitable adaptation of the story and is seen almost every year sometime in the Christmas season.
