Fido is a story about a more skillful zombie trained to serve the human race. Everything breaks down though, when a zombie eats a young Timmy family neighbor. Since then, a disaster has occurred (well, perhaps not a disaster, but to some extent, a mess). Most people deal with the zombie fairly, and one of these characters sleeps with a zombie (a very funny part of the film, if not annoying) and find loving Fido whatever he does. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for this zombie genre. It is also likely that it is one of the least violent zombie films (there is no negative in this statement). I highly recommend it to people looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Rating R for zombie-related violence
