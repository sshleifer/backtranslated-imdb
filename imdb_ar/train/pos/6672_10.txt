I've seen Mystery Men deal with a bit in the press and with the general public (take for example imdb to vote for example), but my general feeling is that Mystery Men are more fun than most movies and certainly smarter than most so-called comedies and nearly "Smart". <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic. Greg Kenner is excellent as well as Jeffrey Rush and Tom Witts. Scene Limo Kenner with Ricky Jay is a "spoiled movie star" ideal as he drinks his character with the right balance between comic book quality and realism to make it work. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the speed of stopping in places, and certainly the visual images are very surprised, perhaps at the expense of further characterization, but in the end, this is a high-definition film industry - it revolves around the small moments "What Up Tiger Lily? " - There are a lot of wonderful things in this movie to make it worth watching repeated.
