I can not believe I'm watching this movie now - I think I might have thought it was another movie about mistreatment of slaves and avoided the roots for the same reason - just as I did not even see Schindler's list - I also do not want to be "enjoying" the pain of other peoples, For their honesty or news. <br /> <br /> So I think the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple is that it was not about blacks being abused by whites. Blacks were quite capable of raping their daughters - or being treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but everyone recovered in the end, and the acting was tremendous! I could not believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! I adore Whoopi to start with - it was amazing. I'm very happy because I was feeling bad yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running purple.
