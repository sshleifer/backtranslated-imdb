This is a wonderful example of Noir. The setting is the early fifties where communists are trying to steal weapons secrets from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is an amputated worm without interference. He gives a very decent performance but there is nothing a-list him. The interesting thing is that he was not only hostile to the hero but through most of the film, he was hostile to the unwanted hero. This is not very normal. Jan Peters performed as superbly as unleashing the heart of gold. That actress with great character Tilma Ritter shines as a stool pigeon. <br /> <br /> The scheme had its fair share of shifts, turns, shocks and difficult talk. There is a fighting scene near the end of the movie (at the metro station) it was wonderful and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans will like this movie. For non-hooligans, it may seem a bit dated and the entire Commie thing is overrated.
