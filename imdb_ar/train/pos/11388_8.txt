If I remember, Ira Gershwin, a lyricist and brother of George, presented a Gershwin catalog of this film, which was produced by producers. In many respects, it was a typical musical in the 1950s by Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincent Minelli with great help from Jane Kelly. <br /> <br /> Gershwins, of course, was one of the greatest bands of Broadway, but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers, a period !!! Gene Kelly, of course, was one of the greatest male dancers of the musical film (one guessing the other?) And I do not imagine his performance was in question. But I think the rest of the actors need some explanation: Oscar Levant was a famous figure in his time, and as an actual friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a nervous musician and endocrine deficiency, and here, as always, plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Karon was unknown at this time and was a French "Gamine". A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Gitari, who plays Maurice Chevalier, pardon, I mean, Henry Borel, was Greek and not French, but he is certainly more than pleasant as a French neighbor even if he is too young for the part. <br /> <br /> The voice of Hoover Gene can be serviced here, but Getari has much better audio equipment. Although it was better to represent Jane elsewhere, as is evident, in "Singin" in the Rain "where his personality is more calculated, so that here he shows himself as a heel at times (he was, not for nothing, cast a role "I got a rhythm" with the children, which does not automatically appear as intended in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Milo also found a disturbing Nina Fuchs character To some extent. <br /> <br /> But obviously the highlight of the film is the long ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with collections and fashion in impressionist painter styles The French are great. <br /> <br /> I have found it hard to believe Jane and Oscar, as mujahideen artists, and I do not think the musical numbers are as well prepared as they may be, but on balance, Gershwin's music is well presented in this film. < br /> <br /> The DVD was done well with clear graphics (when the suppos) Ed to be) and mono sound is good but trivial shallow.
