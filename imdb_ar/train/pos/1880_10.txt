Dudley Moore is wonderful in this classic unknown Largley. This film is a highly intelligent film that relies heavily on the talent of actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gilgod, Lisa Menelli, and a few others, this was a disaster. They are not always well shot, sometimes with some lively music that tries to impose a mood ("psychological" music in the wedding battle), but is overcome by acting. Arthur's character is hilarious, with his comments drunk. But he has evolved well to become a more mature and almost round personality while learning how to live by his own free will. The end is fairly tacky, though. I will not give it up, but it can be improved. Worth seeing several times.
