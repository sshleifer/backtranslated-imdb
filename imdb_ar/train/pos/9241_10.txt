Hey people, what's up. I am a man, only Mike and "Sony Sakura Keller" Kelly. You know ........ You can not really write a review on Sakura text, because we did not have one. To my knowledge, the story was composed only as we went. I spent the best time in my life making this film and got so much clamor that I ran out of Jism ........... enjoyable times. Very happy to enjoy every movie. I really did get to do the battles that I envisioned. Every time I make some moves, the fighting manager continues to change them. However, I was blown up and met some really great people. Especially the purple ninja who seems to be falling into the scene of filmmaking.
