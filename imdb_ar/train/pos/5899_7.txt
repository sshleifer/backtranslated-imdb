A nice idea ... the saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolanda Donnelly) inherits a small small province of Lampedora. That state, which was not even in North America, became the forty-ninth state ... (Of course, there were only 48 states at the time, that was done in 1952 ...) Linda moves to the country where she was inherited , We follow them along trying to figure out what to do with this strange country and its most unusual people. At one point, she sings a song she claims to be from her people, Navajo, and she is smarter than there ... although Yolande Donlan's thick lipstick and her multi-faceted smile have never been cheated or bowed. There are other songs scattered at a time when citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of the technicolor, or equivalent, around the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British expert Tony Craig, cheese seller. Bogarde achieved great success in filmmaking in the UK after serving in the war and was a knight by QE II. Craig and the "New Princess" continue to scream, and their adventures become more intertwined with the worsening of Lampedora's financial problems ... a fun little farce ... like the Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and manager of our small project, and stayed married for 50 years! The guest was known for writing and directing science fiction clicks in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
