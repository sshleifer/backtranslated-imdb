This is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. This is not just a fun movie, or a well-made movie. This is a major milestone in the art of animation, and even if it is not, the artistic skill I have just created will give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a motionless film about the secret life of beetles. Imagine a world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, cinemas, and even small props like posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dragonfly dancer, and a lot of grasshopper anger. But he is a photographer and decides to shoot. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds that Ms. Beetle has a relationship of her own. Mr. Beetle is chasing the beloved away but forgiving his wife. They form and go to the cinema. The film they watch is Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. It seems so ordinary, but once you see it, it becomes a great work of cinema. Along with Emile Cole and Jerry Trinka, Vladislav Staryovic has largely invented what future painters use in their work. That's why you should not forget.
