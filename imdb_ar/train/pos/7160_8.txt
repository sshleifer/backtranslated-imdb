A Disney movie that dares to do something different, should at least be given the effort. "Holes" do not make the same mistakes that one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers being put in a camp. For the first time the events are not explained in detail. The flashback scenes serve a real purpose and offer many mature themes that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was concerned about the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized that we had to take those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also does a good job in questioning some of the methods used in correctional installations. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach reading is because they must dig holes in order to build a character, such as learning to read will not contribute to it). "Holes" is a clever and beautiful film. Must watch!
