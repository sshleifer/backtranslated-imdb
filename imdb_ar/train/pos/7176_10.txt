Well - you want to test someone about how satisfied they are with their teens and the embarrassing and homogenous changes in them - and then get their immediate reaction by watching this angry document about children doing socially related horror jokes in the suburbs of the 1980s. More than any film I have ever seen, the film deals with sexual activity and I am completely humane, not boring, and driven by a kind of inherent good for young people whose color changes because of the adult world frantic with the strange fear of young people based on anything from madness to deviation . It seems that Minnie Mogul Darenne Stein reaches a deeper understanding of his victories and fears as patriarch of the strict world of children. What he finds in himself and in others is not always beautiful - but it shows how one can get better and reconcile with age. What does change mean without thinking? I like this film.
