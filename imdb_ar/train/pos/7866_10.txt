Page 3 **** out of 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madvie (Konkuna Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and leaves him. Look here and there and then go to his bedroom and you get the picture - ah! Another girl ?? That Paddy has two timing and yes he actually has his two timing but she is a guy this time. I say "Fantastic!" <br /> <br /> The end of the saboteurs (the scene above is not really scary ... but for me it was so I did not want to seize the chance) <br /> <br /> When asked how this film was, "Oh, it's just a show for P3 people" that made me think bad watching a stupid movie if there was nothing more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself "I'd better get a pen and a paper to write down bad things about this film," but I proved to be completely wrong? And then some because I can only crowd goods. This movie was wonderful. Great, not because it's an odd and non-commercial cinema like a story, but because of intelligence in a screenplay and how this film tells you how to handle a film brilliantly, which could have been a stupid and unimportant film if it was shown in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Kunkuna Sen Sharma Nima. She's so damn pretty that she played her role just as if she was born to play this part. One of the most charming actresses I have ever seen. But this is not the only good performance in the film. There are Sandhaya Meridol, Booman Iranian and Atul Kolkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul who just fires on the screen. (And guess what Tara Sharma usually does). <br /> <br /> The movies shine with some ridiculous old concerts of bustling celebrities in the film industry and others and you'll get an idea of ​​what's going to happen. For about half an hour during the film, she feels the same way. But then, the film takes quick steps on a good story and never leaves it. Even Iranian Boman agrees with this statement ?? "It was a good story, Madhvi." (thank you). The great thing is that it addresses the question of how ridiculous these people are elegantly and does not make it finished and deals with social issues and does not make them boring. In the end, Madhvi tells us to ride the roller coaster and informs us by smiling at all these people. Just the reason I like watching movies. Erotic filmmaking. Beautiful, intelligent and intelligent scenario.
