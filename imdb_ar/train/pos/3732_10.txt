Joel Schumacher, who also released "Phone Booth", "02" and many other great movies, showed in great detail how no one can really be trained to be a killing machine with the destruction of his personal characters and real fears. To face when going into COMBAT! Colin Farrell (Roland Booz), "Break", '03, gave one of his best performances and carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), Blue Crash, "02" gave a great supportive role and Xia Weigam (Soldier Wilson), All Real Girls, '03, gave his real acting skills in the role he played. There were two brief scenes where soldiers managed to find some hot romance on a short vacation in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One veteran army coach from Viet Nam told the soldiers how they really tortured the enemy by using electric wires in all the wrong places on a male body. A fun and entertaining movie to watch.
