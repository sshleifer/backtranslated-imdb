I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... was and still is the greatest of times. A few days ago my friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I could not believe it! So I took my time and watched the film again .. After many years, and brought me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson but because of the good old times that I remembered back from when I went to his concerts and enjoyed music and dancing. The film gave me another perspective than when I was a kid. You can really see a parody that Michael went through his life. Thanks Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those wonderful times, to your wonderful music and dance. It is a shame that people forget you .. I did not do that because you gave me wonderful moments with your music .. All the best for you wherever you are there ..
