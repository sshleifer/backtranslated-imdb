I came across an Insomniac nightmare while I was looking for odd independent movies and was happy to say that I did not disappoint. This crazy trip that took half an hour made me wonder all the way and the finish was excellent - one of the NOOOOO moments that really stayed with you. I've made it clear to a number of people and everyone seems to agree with them. She was a very talented young girl and I think her performance stole the show. Hick crawled from me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a great job putting this together. All the pieces fell in place and you can say that she is a great writer for what I did in this scenario. Very well written. It is without doubt the strongest part of the film. The output was great and the acting was fun, but the most important factor here is the power of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
