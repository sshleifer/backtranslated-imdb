I think the movie was very good and I will add it to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded some young people that it was still a movie. Some of the mystical points may challenge "logic," but many religious things accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. If you accept any faith you share, you can definitely accept a movie. Did I just notice anyone else that Aga Yi Dagger is the same knife that Lamonte Cranston has had and has had a lot of trouble controlling "The Shadow". I do not mention that in the trivia section of any of the movies here, but I bet on the dollar against donut, which is the same support.
