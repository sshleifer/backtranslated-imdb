Gone in 60 seconds is a very good comedy film that has grossed over $ 100 million but has been criticized by most critics. I personally thought this was a great movie. The story was believable and had the greatest ever cast for this type of film, including Nicolas Cage, the award-winning Academy 3, Robert Duval and Julie Angolina. Unlike the lame trick at the end this is the perfect combination of comedy and dramatic drama. My grade is **** (****)
