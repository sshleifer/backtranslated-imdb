I took this out arbitrarily from the library last night, and I had no idea about the cult of the film, its effect, or that it is currently being shown as a musician. (!) Most of the comments here targeted, he moves, funny sad, and yes, exploitative boy despite the best intentions of directors. The extended Chriterion version is essential for anyone who likes it when it is released. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see the small eddie fall chapter disappeared of this kind, you can hear it in the old movies of Jackie O too; people do not talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary film, it was interesting to have more information on how to fall home in a bad state, and still Old Eddie at least realizes what is going on to some extent; can not you see the house once spectacular break down? <br /> <br /> However, the subject of the film is the life that the two women have built for themselves now, a real life Tennessee Williams. Well worth your time.
