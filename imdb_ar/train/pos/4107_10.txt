I love this movie because it is really strange, very funny, majestic, intelligent ... It makes no sense to tell me about the contents of the film, because then I will give the result! You have to see it without knowing what is going on around it! Everything is linked and has a reason & because. It starts with skill, and then things begin to rotate faster and faster until they culminate in the craziest rage you can imagine! It's more fun to watch the movie the second time, once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this film, it's one of the most I've ever seen!
