As anyone who is old enough knows, South Africa suffered for a long time from the brutal racist persecution of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. Steve Pico was one of the most prominent anti-apartheid activists killed in prison. In the aftermath of the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to deliver Pico's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In the film "The Cry of Freedom," Woods (Kevin Klein) becomes Pico (Denzel Washington) before the latter's capture. shipment. When Woods tries to spread the word Pico, he and his family begin to live under threat of attack, and in the end they are forced to flee the country. The last scene shows the police insisting on the demonstrators. <br /> <br /> As one of two films (along with a "separate world") that helped stimulate the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out as perhaps the best work for all concerned.
