I first heard about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a high school kid (!). It happened that I was browsing the encyclopedias in the classroom for one day, and as part of entering movies (or cinema), you do not remember), there were a lot of shots For different movies from the main stream to the demo, and one of them on the page is still available to OffOn. I really aroused my interest, as it popped the most on the page (it was still a movie scene with an eye with other elements overlapping it). <br /> <br /> After about 18 years or so, the public library here where I live was available for a full 4-DVD collection of the American Film Archive's Treasures of the National Film Foundation. So when I read the notes on the group's DVDs, I was very pleased when I saw OffOn on one of the discs. After all these years, I finally saw the movie! After watching it, I did not expect a bit to be (I was tempted to have a more organic film, that was not a bad thing, but I expected it to have more electronic aesthetics), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, taking into account The techniques used by Scott Bartlett in the production of the film, including the manual coloring of the film itself, and the use of video equipment for some of the scenes of the film (filmed from a video screen), giving it more a sad look, an accurate look. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, the techniques used in this film were very pioneering in 1972. That's why one of my favorite short / experimental films remains a creative inspiration for me as well ...
