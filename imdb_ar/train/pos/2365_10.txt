Jeff Wincott is not only a big piece, he can kick! This film contains some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Well, so maybe Bridget Nelson was not the first person he hired to play ruthlessly, you did a great job worthless! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film played by martial arts expert / Kent Sheppard. So they are not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares ?! It's as good as if it were not better! (Just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie, word: ouch !!). My suggestion is to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you do not see it, you will lose some great martial arts work.
