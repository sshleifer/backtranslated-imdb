The "Last Hunt" memory has been stuck with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13 years old. It was a film that was very advanced to others at that time because it treated the indigenous people and the environment, in contrast to the ever present between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as in 1956, a cinematic discussion with the utmost depth and importance. To top of the setting is beautiful and excellent cinematography. The memory of this film will be with me until the end of my days.
