This movie is one of my favorites. It's a mix of genre with Action / Horror / Romance / Comedy components. Some special effects may seem old compared to modern standards. This simple flaw is easily ignored. There is much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is very beautiful which hurts me. very nice picture. The work is wonderful and not surprising, it is sourced from Honkong, the hometown of the best motion movies in the world. The humor sometimes seems a bit silly but in a good way. Somehow, this film is able to balance the mood and keeps its health completely recommended.
