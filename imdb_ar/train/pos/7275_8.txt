No Strings Attached Carlos Menesia presents a position that makes us laugh and think. He does not only make fun of ethnic issues (as so many crooks claim), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... What does a woman mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... Why are Americans more mad than Arab terrorists ... Why does not anyone need to pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in heaven ... A theory about how to start Easter traditions (also known as Big Boys until Jesus Day) "- the argument without cascading with a woman about whether he was influenced by Christ or not ... How should the physically disabled society be treated ... and h If you have the right to tell a joke or not. <br /> <br /> Also, never stop reminding us that each of us has a voice. So we must use it to express the truth, to say what we think, and not to be afraid if others are insulted. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
