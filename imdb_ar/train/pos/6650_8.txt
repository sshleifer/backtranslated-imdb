I do not want to comment on the quality of the film or what the flaws are because I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge of making films. What I know is that making this kind of film in your first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director on that. However, in some of the reviews, which I read, critics complained that Heral's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his brothers were completely wiped out of the story. Now I would really like to make a point here, as the name of the film suggests, that it is not a film about the brothers of Heral, it is a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son, Heralal Gandhi, and nothing less. If we start complaining about the lack of some characters in the film, it would be unfair to some extent because these characters do not fit the picture, regardless of their appropriateness in real life. So I think it would be better if we stuck to the main idea and stopped pleasing ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
