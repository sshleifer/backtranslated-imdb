Super Speedway offers a great display of the new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 audio system. The IMAX camera puts you directly into the race car, cruising the various tracks at high speed, reminding us of the Grand Prix driving sequence (if only on a DVD!). I enjoy seeing it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only proposition, why I did not give it 10, is some command sequence that looks suspiciously like a movie acceleration. Soundtracks also require a simple commentary on kufr - all you hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear Swush as you go under bridges.
