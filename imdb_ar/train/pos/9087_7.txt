Saxophone player Rooney Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He lives in a Hollywood hotel (of course). At the same time, the great selfish star Mona Marshall (Lula Lin) suffers from a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new portrait. In a state of panic, the studio rents a Virginia-like (Rosemarie Lynn) character for her impersonation and makes the Bowers take her to the premiere not to tell him she is not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can pretty much identify the rest of the plot yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (with wonderful words) but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very popular couple and have beautiful singing voices. The result is good (notably "Hooray for Hollywood") and Busby Berkeley showcases its unique image in a truly interesting sequence (with Edgar Kennedy burning it slowly). Glenda Farrell also has a few funny shots as Monas' sister-in-law. <br /> <br /> The movie is still not good. The rest of the cups are cast furiously and most humor is not just funny. Lola Lane especially is a poor attempt to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a typical black maid is being laughed at and there is some truly horrifying "humor" at some point. Maybe this is what keeps this TV out most of the time. I realized that it was accepted at the time, but today it seems disgusting. <br /> <br /> All in all a movie with some serious problems helped by good actors and some great songs. Give it 7.
