When I saw this movie I began to feel very nostalgic. When I was growing up in a rural area, I felt like I was a kid again! The swimming pool (dubbed "The Tank" in central Texas), passes through the countryside like a wild free spirit! The story was very reasonable and completely lost and I cried to the end. Through the pain we experience in life ... life continues and there can be remission.
