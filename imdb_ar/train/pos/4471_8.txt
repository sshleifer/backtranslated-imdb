Jane Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Eturby starred in George Sidney's "Anchors Aweigh". <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two Navy men on vacation in Hollywood. They meet a young boy (Dean Stockwell) and when they take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. She wants a test for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is a mixed mix. <br /> <br /> It is a very lively music with great dance and singing for Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the mouse in a delightful sequence. Graceon sings Galusi and my heart sings. Not one of my favorite sounds, but it does well. The piano work in Iturbi is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra has many uses and why girls beat him, with those big blue eyes and boyish face. For Kelly, this was a great break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie, very busy.
