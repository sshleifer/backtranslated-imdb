Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it was the strange husband who brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mato have wonderful chemistry. The support team for this film is also excellent. <br /> <br /> It is about two men living together from opposite planets. Bristles script with the humor of this situation. This has been done in some forms previously. This is the person who brings it all together in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did some other decent work, but this is really his best work that made the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine Simon leading this.
