Go to this movie to see the great photos of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures, and enjoy a wonderful and engaging experience. Music completes the shots perfectly, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators described the interview with the artist as a weak place, but keep in mind: Why do you expand on that in a film, if you can read Andy's lengthy reflections in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures? This method is more appropriate to show the temporary nature of the artist's work, and is used with experience in this regard.
