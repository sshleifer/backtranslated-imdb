When John Singleton is on, he is * in * !! This is one of his best films. Not so tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to him (and with many star actors). This film was well written, well placed together, and well shot. There is nothing much to criticize, and most superficial complaints (for example: where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and many expensive things?) No mention was made of a rich background ... Why did not Professor Vibs be consulted? From his stature ... one ... While we are there, for engineering student, heck or not, Remy is a pretty stupid person - I think he'll have a little more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a complete clown). <br /> <br /> But aside, the film was very sharp. A good collection of characters and views; Singleton is not alone in the story - many characters do not sympathize, and do a good job of interspersing panthers and Supremacist together to show folly on both sides. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was excellent. I particularly liked the scene as Kirsty Swanson became intimate with Tarin and Wayne, where each scene was well combined. Malik / Deja scenes were also filmed well. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often too much; this film tends to get * really * preaching sometimes, and also tends to highlight the points it raised on your head when the points are equally clear and not explicit We really did not need the American flag with "UNLEARN" written on it, give some credit, we are not crazy ...). To overcome this, although * Single * Singleodrama often uses melodrama well, and sometimes becomes * very abnormal (such as Deja's death, which is good enough to scream "why !!!" that simply destroyed the effect and the scene). <br /> <br /> But acting, in general, was the top line. (And probably the best I've ever seen), and Christie Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?) And Michael Rapaport (surprised me by the hell of me ... after the real romance and pretty girls I was though he was a single actor from one role ), Of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne * Always * Fantastic * <br /> <br /> The downside? Jennifer Connelly was flat. Although this is not entirely wrong: it has been a typical role. General to the highest degree. Tyra Banks, who had a role, was not terrible. It's whine, whine and whine. Another thing in the long line of fashion models who turned into actors failed miserably (although there are few that prove the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wonderful! Fantastic soundtrack (definitely worth buying!) Suited to the film as a glove. Each scene has a twin song (although the songs of Tori Amos really bother me by the end ... and not the best work for them). Liz Fire, The Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... How can one make a mistake? <br /> <br /> All in all: a really good watch, a really wonderful movie, a great screenplay, a great movie. 10/08.
