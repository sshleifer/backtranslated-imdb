This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard it would be nonsense, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not feel the leadership girl and did not really care if she lived or died. After a while I grew up and became a pet figure. It's not just a bright film where people die for no reason. There is a background story that takes only a few seconds of film, but it explains a lot. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure to watch it anyway, it will be only an hour and a half of your life. You will live for 80 years anyway.
