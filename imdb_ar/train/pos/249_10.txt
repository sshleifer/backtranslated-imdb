I've seen the trailer several times, and I have to say that Ned Kelly seems to be a great movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not get my eyes out of it (it certainly caught my eye). Heath Ledger adheres to what he knows and what works for him. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, seen in the second season, looks great. I think this film will be a great success and will see many people over and over again.
