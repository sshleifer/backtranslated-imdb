When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is contacted by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a strange bet. Incredible Bo confirms that all his terrifying stories are based on a real experience. Foster accepts a bet from Bo and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend a whole night at Blackwood Castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, where he is contacted by many beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor in metaphysics - explains that they are all lost souls lying to recount their death stories and the memory of their deaths! The first time I saw this glorious thing of classic horror, I was fascinated all the time. I found the film crawling and sad at the same time. Babes Steele is undoubtedly beautiful. The musical result makes the atmosphere exciting for terrorism. He threw me a naked scene in a ring, so I did not expect it. Synapse seems to have done a great job with improving the image, because this film looks good for its time, and is an Uncut International version, to boot. This is the film responsible for the start of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
