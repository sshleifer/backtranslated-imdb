The American icon Henry Fonda John Howard depicts the "elegant," an old truck driver who has recovered his large rig Eleanor after a long stay in hospital forced him to miss his payments. He decides that he wants to run only once more perfect, he gets out of the hospital and steals back Eleanor and deals with the old friend Penelope Pearson (Elaine Brennan), who needs to move her team of prostitutes. /> <br /> The wonderful performance of Fondas is a natural anchor for a film that falls in the heart as effectively as tickling the funny bone in comedy scenes. A wonderful group of actors including Robert Englund, as a reluctant little friend, Susan Sarandon (who also gets a co-producer credit), and Dob Taylor (as always, in the hilarious part of the picture) Large. <br /> <br /> The nature of the image confirmed for life and the intensity of the trip are incredibly loaded; this is a picture, provided you enter it, you can remember it for a long time after it ends. <br /> <br /> The open road promise is clearly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. He was appointed to the wonderful Craig Savans musical grade, a wonderful image in terms of beauty. <br /> <br /> She loses a little something in her final work (the characters played by John Penner and Austin Pendleton are nothing more than interventions), but she still maintains her positive feelings thanks to the attraction of her central characters. <br /> <br /> Not the image of the exploit / coup that one might expect from the title (especially its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock") is a rewarding film experience that I can recommend without qualifying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
