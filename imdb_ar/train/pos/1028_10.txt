I must say, from the beginning, when I watched a Stargate movie, I was not blown away or anything like an average science fiction film, with so much potential, although the film was not surprising. Like other science fiction movies like Star Wars or Aliens, which if you are a science fiction fan you will know that one of these titles is amazing, although I am not a fan of hardcore science fiction like some people, remember one line from any of those movies, I think I do not have to be a fan of science fiction to love this wonderful series, which unfortunately ended after 10 years. The seasons are amazing without any drop in quality as they approached it > Although I did not like the movie very much, I was looking forward to the first season of 1997, let me tell you, that the special effects were only one of the films were unfamiliar things about the serial, the chemistry between The characters that amazed me away from the special effects, good, if not better than most of today's science fiction performances. I have to admit that I would never go to Sci fi if it was not for the stargate, and my father, who actually pushed me to sci fi when I was six, and I'm glad he did it, and other wise I've seen wonderful shows like SG1, which Now, from my point of view, it is almost a standard for almost all science fiction films and films. If the new science fiction series is not as good or as good as SG1, it is not worth watching. This is the best scientific show yet, and if you do not see this, you'll have no idea what you're missing!
