I'm surprised that we even see one publisher criticizing this old film. We usually do not get good opera movies, and here's a real show of grand operas. It is understood that the pictures are not great. It's dated. But as a opera it can not be faulted; I am buff opera. I can not even discover one verbal synchronization; if we did not know that it was in my voice, nothing would convince me that it was not Sofia Loren. It does everything with taste! Her dark makeup is fine. She has brought a role in a wonderful life! The rest of the crew is fantastic, as is the amazing ballet ensemble. Most of the actors are excellent. Lauren is really wonderful. Her rival Amneris is also fantastic. Who did not care for this post in 1953 disappears shamefully had Verdi enjoyed it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
