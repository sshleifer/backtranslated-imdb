I saw this in the early 1970s (when I was 16 years old), and despite the long slow preparation, meetings, riots, etc., as soon as the entire desert section started to get in the way and loved it. (I still do it, it has progressed very well.) At that time I was in what appeared to be a small minority. All the criticism seemed to focus on lack of action and narrative. Luckily I am no longer in this minority. <br /> <br /> It subtly presents (in a somewhat prophetic fashion) the political schism, turmoil, confrontation, brutal repression, commercial exploitation and deception that await. <br /> <br /> Appreciation for this judicial film has grown and I am so happy.
