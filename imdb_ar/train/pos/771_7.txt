I watched the movie with a gay friend and my wife and her friend. So I had views of all kinds of trends. In the first place, the film made me laugh, sexual tension did not exist, and the only notable actors were Theodor Cheryla and Maria Pobistasu. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the script was inappropriate. There were good Roman representatives, who did not have complicated roles. I salute Boya entering the film business. I do not know the reason, but I think he is a good man, I hope to be a good representative. <br /> <br /> Although the wife liked the movie, I thought maybe there were ropes being played which I did not have any ear to. If the film tries to introduce uncommon sexual behavior and its consequences in Romania today, it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that girls are boys and girls, and that the story itself becomes just a boring and uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why she got all these BAFTA awards. In my book, I had to be awarded the "Better Luck Next Time" award. (BAFTA = Good Luck in Romanian).
