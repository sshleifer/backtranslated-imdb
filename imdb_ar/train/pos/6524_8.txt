<br /> <br /> If you're ever interested in pirates, pirate movies, American history in New Orleans, early 19th century or Yul Yuliner, watch this movie yourself and make your mind the same. Can not be put off by various dim reviews. My reaction was that it was amusing and good-humored (for the most part), had a very intelligent dialogue, and did an excellent job of portraying the magic, appeal and legendary charm of the soldier Jean Lafitte. While all the events in the film are not historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel that the film is accurate in its handling of the role played by Lafitte in the history of New Orleans, and love - the relationship between hatred among "respectable" In New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but watch it for what it does, to study it for one of the most interesting historical figures in New Orleans.
