The best performance of Keital Harvey so far is the new century. It was filmed in a very cool way, a wonderful snapshot of the pre-Castro era in Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local petty crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with links to Hollywood. It's really about the moment a boy awakes to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually lives in a much larger and more complex world that he does not understand yet. The script is strong and full of humor, and the trend is crisp. On the whole, a truly professional job commensurate with Latin American cinema traditions. The only weakness is the decision to launch English with a syncing voice instead of Spanish - perhaps to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this makes the film less convincing. But if you can see beyond this, you will find a friendly trip to another world. Recommended.
