This is the first 10 out of 10 I gave him any film. What made this movie very good for me? Continuous work - there are no slow parts, wonderful work, smart writing. I also liked the style of photography where I made it vibration and different angles feel like part of the scene. Finally, I get an action film that does not try to please all segments of the audience (that is, there is no obligatory love story). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Warning - After watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving!
