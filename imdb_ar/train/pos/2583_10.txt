The greatest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for beginners. This is a great movie. There is no private agency involved in the plot. This is the idea! This particular plot was created as a private enterprise. This is self-destructive conspiracy and self-regulation. In conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self-regulating, self-destructive, without any trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: the clever "exit" has some money. Everything can be done only by authorization. The director must be just an operator. If the ordinary viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the film, the real plot has fewer chances of being discovered. All actors perform well, with some special tribute to Jane Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
