After seeing Batman the Terrible, the Terrible, the Terrible: the deadline was over I knew I should see this once I heard it. <br /> <br /> Clicking on the Play To play the trailer I thought I was in another short, hateful film that seemed so far like a bad filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to an existing character. But instead I was greeted with a wonderful GREATLY trailer for a film that unfortunately did not exist, because I love watching a movie that was finished even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST For BATMAN: The Dead Is Dead Then Some. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next shortcut!
