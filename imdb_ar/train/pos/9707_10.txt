About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought about giving up the TV completely until a friend who lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and League of Gentlemen. Then I decided to switch to British television. Of all the above shows, The League of Gentlemen is the darkest and most twisted of all, providing guilty laughs and non-existent material in any other comedy I've seen so far. The characters involved are the most unhappy couple, the butcher who puts the ingredients in the meat free of charge (perhaps for the better), the disgruntled couple who look at a local shop serving only locals, and the worst vet ever. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
