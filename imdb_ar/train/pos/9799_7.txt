Batman animated movie fun. Not on par with the "return of Joker" or "Phantom Mask", but nevertheless solid. I loved how the film kept you guessing about who she was. There was a nice twist. Nice work sequence. I've always seen that Batman's cartoons are better than any animated Batman movie. This trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 of 10
