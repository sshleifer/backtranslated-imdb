A tough movie to comment on, how do you say it's bad? Well, it was not, but it's also hard to say it's good. What it is, is an attractive offer, is the closest thing you will get to the mitigation without being there. It's a tsunami picture approaching the coast of Thailand and has revived life, you know you want to get away but you have to see it. <br /> <br /> The Nudit brothers deal with the commentary very well, even in most of the tragedy of the circumstances, there is an opinion on something that is happening in another country that does not beat or insult. Facts are about cellulose and there is little need for the viewer to understand or understand what is going on. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you should not want this film to be a testimony to humanity in the darkest hour.
