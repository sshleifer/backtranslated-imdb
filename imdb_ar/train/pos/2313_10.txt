"Teenage Age" deals with the experiences of two young girls, Danny and Maureen, who learn life and love one summertime summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his wonderful work "To Kill the Emulator", the film never reaches the wrong observation. All acting is wonderful. Kedani, Reese Witherspoon makes an amazing film. When I saw this beautifully filmed film, directed and edited beautifully, I felt like I was looking through a window on reality, rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I have watched this film at least five times, and I can honestly assume that it is one of the best individual films that have been produced because you are young, that you are in love, and you know about the feelings, challenges and changes in the age of majority. Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 must see it together and use it as a discussion story, because it raises a number of problems about sibling rivalry, how to deal with love, parental responsibilities, etc.
