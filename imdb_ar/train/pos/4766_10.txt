It is unusual to watch a film in which one actor performs so well that one can feel that the film will be of little interest, if any, without his presence. <br /> <br /> Despite the unremarkable trend - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to have been filmed very quickly and carelessly - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot for a man who wants to replace a priest who has been removed And other points of the week, and the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that it is shocked from start to finish terrible. <br /> <br /> I have never seen nor can I imagine a better performance in the future, so Paul Schofield acts in "Man of All Seasons". <br /> <br /> In fact, the end can be considered absurd if Frisnay does not play the deceptive priest who returns to the church by committing a crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prétre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said brilliantly to forget one of the madness of Nice that has been achieved to this end. <br /> <br /> The other impressive thing about this film is one scene in Murand state - which despite being a cracked one, still a priest - devotes in a nightclub a large amount of grape vine to the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gerrard - the man who wants to return Morand to the church or replace himself - must drink it if he does not want to leave it in a nightclub. . He does it amid cheers and applause from people who think he simply drinks three of the four vine droppings. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the cocks between Morand and the garbage collector are also remarkable. "Do you carry the men away?" Asks Morand, who hates himself for what he just did. "This will be a lot of work" is the smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is definitely worth seeing because of the very strong and exotic atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think Le défroqué is a very strange film, but it should be seen by all viewers - if good catholicism is mandatory - because jewell is very rare in the film's history. <br /> <br />
