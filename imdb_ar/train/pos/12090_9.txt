I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in the basement of my parents on a Saturday night. It was shown on "Ciller Theater", a regular horror film I saw as a young man. Now, I've seen many old horror movies thanks to the Chiller Theater, but I've never stuck with me like "Danse Macabre", like "Castle of Blood". I am now 55 years old, and just last year I was lucky enough to locate a new high-quality DVD version of this impressive and wonderful kind, after I thought I would never be able to see it again. I've seen it four more times, and I do not seem tired of it. <br /> <br /> They are no longer making such scary films. The domed catacombs and foggy cemeteries do not work as well in color as they did in black and white in the daytime. In any case, this collection contains the castle of Edgar Allan Bo and Barbara Steele, which are shady, spider-shaded castle clusters, and turbulent spirits reviving their death ... and an evil cynical end. <br /> <br /> IMO, that's right there with Robert the wise "haunting", "innocent" (with Deborah Kerr), the most modern "others".
