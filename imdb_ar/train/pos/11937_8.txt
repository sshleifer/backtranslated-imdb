This was definitely the case with the angels at Utfield. I was on TV last night and I think I have not seen the film since my second year in high school and am now in my fourth year at college. Although the film has many flaws, it is not touched but you can only sit and watch it and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Danny Glover's scream is just so much higher that you can only laugh out loud most of the time. He adds to the film and I am sure that what the director wanted exactly. Actually feel the characters in the film although the development is not the best. Must see. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
