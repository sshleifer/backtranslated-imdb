This movie has so much horror that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it enabled. I always find human and real characters. It's a film that shows you the tragic reality of life in Los Angeles, from the lights of frequent search for helicopters looking for the dangers inherent to the normal life of the characters. It's also a film that shows you how a stranger's kindness can change your life and make you change. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you do, whether intentional or not, has strong implications. I found that this film is similar in many ways to Robert Altman's short film. Both have a starry list of actors and actresses cast perfectly. Both films have allowed you to gradually see how characters are intertwined and affected, for the better or for the worse. Grand Canyon has done a better job of delivering a coherent message (Hope in the face of a desperate reality), more than Altman, although I found both of them interesting. This film is clear must see!
