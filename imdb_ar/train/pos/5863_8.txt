Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not come too late or was unnecessary. It is one of the few that are trying to deal with the sad side of the second war: time after that. Unlike movies such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo" used to present their main characters as broken heroes in a post-war environment, this film allows the audience to face a different view of veterinarians in Vietnam. Their development appears precisely before the war and especially after it. The problems are obvious but in all this tragic, there is always a feeling of some hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the quietest movie in Vietnam at all, but after nearly 15 years, this is really reasonable and justified. Moreover, it can make us believe that the war is not yet over; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro is one of his best, but Ed Harris is the star of the film. This was probably his best performance ever.
