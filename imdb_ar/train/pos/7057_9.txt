As an adult, I really enjoyed this. I saw it with two grandchildren and my 3 and a half year old daughter and the 15-month-old fuss was mingling with mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animations are fantastic. This sequel does what the return to Neverland does. A good follow up to the Cinderella story. But what becomes of Drusella? Other sequel? I hope so!
