Miike makes an adventure film for children, no different from the story of Neverending. It's actually one of my less favorite films for the director. Even the worst mike is better than many good movies, and the Great Yokai War has a lot to recommend. It is at least as loud and obnoxious as most American children's clicks. I think the kids themselves will find a lot they like (DVD includes English), but like all Miike movies, they tend to move very slowly. This means that you got a kind of strange contrast, where sometimes there is a high voice sequence and the next scene will continue forever as the characters speak. The story itself is not very good, as the constant Miike dysfunction of inconsistency raises his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the artistic side of things. This movie should be Mike's most expensive and looks great. "Yokai" are Japanese souls, they come in different shapes, fictional, fashion designers, and special effects crew, and everyone who participated in the designs did a great job. I saw the 1968 film, Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare. The monsters of the cheese rubber suit you can find have turned into more authentic entities using the latest make-up and special effects. I particularly liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who has dark eye shadows, tight clothes, white, a white bee hairstyle and whip. I played, by the way, by Chiaki Koriyama, whom you may remember as a teenage girl Lucy Liu in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film was the role of Ryunosuke Kamiki, who made sounds in Miyazaki's "Spirited Away" and the castle of the animated howl.
