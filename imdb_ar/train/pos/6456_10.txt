My expectations were very high for this film. All those who watched this film in the cinema told me that everyone stayed there because of the funds they received. My expectations could not have been higher, anything less than wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this film. I liked how you dealt with difficult topics without going through the usual steps Hollywood tends to include. In this film, film characters suffered from problems they had faced for decades, suffered prejudice, and learned to open up. But that was not easily achieved, not just by singing a song or two. It was painful, the arguments took, and the confrontations took place. It looked like a real reality. <br /> <br /> Gabriella's scene was one of the scenes in which she really hung up. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, and her voice is beautiful, and you can say that she was not just a verbal sync with a previous recording while filming (which I often find in other films), she has already sang her whole body and spirit. You can feel what Gabriela felt in this scene. If this film was made in Hollywood, it is likely to sing her song in the end, and would make her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, as well as make other people in the village realize something or two. Instead, it came halfway, and brought no solutions. Her husband did not get angry and he knew what he was doing to her and did not seem to make anyone else in the village more open. She was beautiful, she was pure and she was impressive but she did not solve all her problems magically. This is a real feeling for me, and this is probably what would have happened in real life. The entire film felt like a real reality to me, and it ended with nothing but a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a film that feels realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some things that bothered me, but hey, there's no perfect movie. If you are not already, you should go to see "as they are in paradise" and fill the joy of life, a sense of hope and a sense that you have touched the level movies rarely reach. You will be sad, tired, happy and dozens of other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if everyone in the world sang in a choir, there would be no other wars. After watching this movie, I may need to agree.
