This ripped the west and I watched it several times and enjoyed it on every level. So if you have real facts about myths such as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested that this is the West when the truth becomes a legend that prints the legend. The story moves at an accelerated pace, and there is some wonderful dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very exciting stars who help produce this film. Indian scouts, and there is also a young Anthony Quinn making his debut as a warrior Cayenne, and has already married one of Demel's daughters in real life. Indeed, his character from Queens, who informed Cooper of the Custer massacre that was immediately reported, was a good ending. This is done when the credits are added to integrate the American West into American history. So please spend some time watching this classic West.
