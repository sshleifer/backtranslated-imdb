In the prison, four cell prisoners are employed: Carrere (Gerald LaRouche), who used his company to commit a fraud and betrayal of his wife; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protection, the retarded Péquerette (Dimitri Rathud), who ate his sister for six months; , Who killed his wife. One night Carrier found an old magazine hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realized that this book was written by Danvers (Jeffrey Curry) at the beginning of the last century and relates to black magic. They decide to read and use their content to escape prison, when they discover the true fate of Danvers. "Maléfique" is a French horror film with a low and intriguing budget. The story is almost the same place, does not contain any cliches and connects the viewer's attention to the last scene. I am a fan of French cinema, usually romances, drama and detective stories, but recently I have seen some good French horror films such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal"
