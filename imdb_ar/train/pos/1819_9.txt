When I first saw this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and we saw it about 3 times. We just saw him again and loved him more than she did the last time I saw him !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs named Charlie and Eichi (via Dom Duys and I love Dom Dewes!). Charlie is half a gangster and half-Judy, and I love it. Itch is the companion to him. Charlie was killed by his friend (no) and sent to paradise. When Charlie returns to life, it's the beginning of a great adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons why I'm crazy about this movie are: One: I love characters (except Karps). My favorite three are Charlie, Eichi and a little girl named Ann Marie come later. Second: I love the period of history that this film is set. Has been set during embargo in the United States. Three: Animation without Bloth (as usual) is fantastic. The backgrounds are very good. Four: There's a strange excitement in this film that makes me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this beautiful. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, the beating, the thrill" ... <br /> <br /> So, watch this beautiful movie when you can, and you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
