Well, I saw this movie as a child and really loved it. My parents never bought the film for me, but I think I'll buy it now. I sucked for animated films before 2000. Anyway, on the actual review. <br /> <br /> What I liked: there was a real depiction of Heaven and Hell, one of the few films I saw in animated films. Personal development exists! Easy to classify the characters in this film (for example: Charlie is the selfish buster, his trifle trivial but thinks Charlie, obviously Carvis is the relentless villain, etc.). I also loved the song King Gator. I've always loved the noisy, annoying players. This song may have been random, but it was very fun. Finally, the details of the animation were beautiful. You can tell that Charlie had everything naughty and things that were beautiful and backgrounds. <br /> <br /> What I did not like: the actual portrayal of the sky: the way Charlie reacted, "it was no surprise at all", made her seem very dull. He denied a place in the sky and STILL came back to him in the end. I remember a few lines of some songs like "... you can not keep a good dog", "... make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead" remember the majority of them. The songs were not attractive, to be honest. Angel and White: It's annoying and this decade! August! <br /> <br /> What parents may not like: Some very scary images (according to the viewer) are displayed while Hell is playing. Carface is very threatening. The beer is also tacit, but not actually the DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element in the film. The good man dies. <br /> <br /> In general: I like this movie, even if it is forgotten at times. Children's scary animation is always my favorite. This was created again at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give children some fear every now and then. At present, this may have been rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or children with disorders easily) should not see this. Otherwise, give it 9/10. :) Happy viewing!
