Once you can override the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a wonderful movie, probably one of the best John Waters movies. This wonderful film, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are some horrific scenes that are not suitable for young children, but they exist for a particular purpose. Unfortunately, this film is not widely produced, most of the audience will be deprived of the opportunity to watch it. If the opportunity knocks, go to see this movie.
