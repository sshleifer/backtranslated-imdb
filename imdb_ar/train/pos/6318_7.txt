I have tried to hire this on many occasions, but I was always with the girlfriend, who usually refuses clicks and steals comedy with a comment "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for this movie." So enter the night of "Sulu Almighty"! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood a fairly enjoyable film. Although he can be forgotten to some extent, he enjoys moments of fun and some laughter laughs at high moments. I was not aware of the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watched movies that try to ignore that fact and watch it based on their own merits anyway. George Clooney put on a comic veil and partly in a wheel-breaking cracker, which left me mostly wondering about two things. 1. Is not every comedy better if Mr. Clooney put on a strange veil of 5 minutes? 2. How do they make fake shams seem old and faded, and how easy to wash it? The cast of actors, all of them good actors, has really put in a great job, and you have the impression that they have a good time working together, which is fairly important in a film like this. Needless to say, everything is not going as planned in this film, be it a tale or a humor, but it made me check out the special features and think about watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time and maybe grab a few friends and pizza. You'll have a fun time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> In a side note, the soundtrack is amazing. It is wonderful to hear what is less than the appreciation used by Paolo Conti, and left me a ton of notes of the outcome long after the credits expire.
