I watched this movie as a child in Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, although it was not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, which is different from what I remember because on the DVD I bought many scenes where the actors speak French and / or Italian and no translations are provided. The other representatives in English respond to what has been said. kind of weird. In the DVD box, the names of some representatives are also spelled differently than IMDb. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this film is different in that Elsie's personality takes off her clothes and provides a nude shot in a scene. In another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) out with her by pushing her down on the bed Kissing them while Steele resisted. This scene was in the TV version, but it was very much modified. I wonder if there are any additional footage that can be integrated into a super-precision version that has been reformulated? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics have been broken down into small parts and sold in all types of releases that have been edited. Where are the main straps and all unused footage? <br /> <br /> Apart from the first dull twenty minutes before Allen's delivery to the castle, the rest of the movie is very good. There are not many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia made him a good club). The terrifying atmosphere and strange and strange appearance of Barbara Steel make the film far too good. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steel is not present in this film, it would be a big zero. They make ten movie!
