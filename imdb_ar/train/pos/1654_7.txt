A young woman married to the city (Kay Francis) works in a local newspaper store and plays the role of a leading lady in her local theater, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actress arrives, a ham, a front air bag, and a take-off, to the city you visit in his room and dreams offer her advice to stardom - pretending that his servant is his "boss" who fools her to believe everything she needs but an "experience" to become a big star. Discovers her husband and punches the man resulting in the unexpected death of the actor - leading to a murder trial and even more unexpected: life sentence for Baal. The next thing you know is that she joined the mobile Burlesque show in the hope that she would reach Broadway one day and earn enough money to get her husband's freedom - all the time her baby slept in a box! <br /> <br /> This movie has a very interesting plot, well, perhaps a little elusive, but very melodramatic (with lots of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - everything * enhanced by the strong and emotional performance offered by Kai Francis - It just makes this movie. We are also helped by the good representation played by Minna Gombell in her role as a '' forty-year-old '' priest and a priest. Worth seeing, especially for fans of Kai Francis.
