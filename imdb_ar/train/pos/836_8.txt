It is unlikely that this film will be voted as the best comedy of the year, and a few coincidences and holes plot. However, we are talking about a movie becomes a successful man and white bread seller friends, so there should be a few surprises surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, he has gone James Bond the wooden (the role in which he wasted). If he can maintain this kind of quality, I hope he will continue to make comedies. Greg Kenner is also excellent as a straight man for Brusnan. I have read some negative comments here about Hope Davis but I thought it was very good as a mosquito housewife with a dark side buried deep inside. There are a lot of good low-pitched laughs, while Brosnan fails in his way and a few scenes where I almost die of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost it when Julian described himself as a "facilitator". Like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another successful comedy, humor can be very dark. If you are in be prepared to enjoy yourself.
