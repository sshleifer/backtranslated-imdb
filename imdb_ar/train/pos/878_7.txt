Interesting characters, a lot of tension. Closer to black and white without being black and white. I was struck by how a dominant figure who supposedly sympathized, a quiet and deaf minister near deaf, turned into a crime to destroy colleagues and restrict people on her way and finally engage in theft, creating someone to collide off as a trap getting her away. I was a little moved by the trend towards high-quality films to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without treating the injuries they were subjected to other than portraying their immediate opponents as shakes. In this film, we never know who is the money they really run away from, or what happens to the innocent wife used by the sympathetic deaf minister to prepare the barge owner to fall for the lost booty. Too bad, the film could have been great.
