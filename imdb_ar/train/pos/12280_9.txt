This is one of the few films I've seen twice in the theater. I really like this film because of the genre and the tragic hero's life story Esteban Trueba. He made many mistakes but got a chance to save. Is not this a fairly comforting idea? <br /> <br /> When I first saw her, I thought that after the election he won, the film would end - I did not know the book. The boy was wrong when her dramatic climax was still coming! I was literally swept up by the sheer force of the last half of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie completely. I can not understand that one bit. Perhaps those who read the book first - as is often the case with screen revisions of novels - are simply disappointed because so many things remain undisturbed, invisible or unknown. But the film tells an impressive story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep sympathy of women, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and preservation) - this film is simply wonderful! Moreover, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the actors are also great - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the movies invented by the cinema!
