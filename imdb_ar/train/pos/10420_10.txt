Great Caruso presents the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting ability and is at the highest level as a lyricist, coupled with Dorothy Kirsten, the soprano at the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare say that it performs some of the best songs of Caruso (cf. A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza of Rossini). MGM art and music also managed a good job. This film could have been perfect, had it not been for the awkward presence of Ann Blythe; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in 1950s style in scenes before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better lady and Blyth should stick to less demanding production. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera songs in the film with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had a kind of permanent soprano.
