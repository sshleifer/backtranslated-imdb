British pilot George Taylor (a solid portrait by Giuseppe Bambere) was beaten by thugs after spending a night in Hong Kong. George meets with Dr. Amy Wong sweet and virgin (wonderful and charming performance by Chai Lee the beautiful). George regains his health and returns to his work. When Amy fails to hear George for a long time, she gives up and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-writer Bitto Albertini already offers a satisfying amount of tasty nudity expected and sex filled with soft steam, this film represents nothing but your routine exercise of severe corruption. Instead, it is an amazing, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very attractive characters (Chai, like Amy Wong, radiant and particularly lovable). The picture begins in the bubble and the joy, but the tone turns radically into a gloomier and darker mood about two-thirds of the way. Emmy's descent into vice after assuming a lie that George had given up was dark and distressing; the sudden thing sad and surprisingly sudden. Granted, the narration is definitely melodramatic, but never too silly or litter. Moreover, the sex scenes are very tasty and so really erotic. The notorious Italian star Ilona Staller has a big role in backing Secretary of State George Gior and the unpopular Helen Miller. The glossy Guido Mancori film offers many wonderful, wonderful shots of exotic sites. Nikko Fedenko's record of unexpected results amazing. Worth a look for those looking for something different.
