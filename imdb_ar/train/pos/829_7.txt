I will admit, I think this film will not be good but I soon changed my mind. The film kept you guessing the direction it was going. Pierce Brusson is amazing in his role as a successful man, suddenly he is getting burned and asked a man he met in a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kenner is a wonderful straight guy, his role as a gentleman from Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican pub. The film will laugh while Pierce delivers funniest linens (mostly for sex). <br /> <br /> The fantasy in this film is very well done, especially in the scene of bullfighting and when Pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.
