It was an excellent two-part episode, although I never saw it at all, but I never thought the doctor would hit anything unnatural, of course outside the ground but not an algorithm. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we fear most and others, and how, at a future time, humans can fight and defeat real living evil when most possibilities say it will be impossible. <br /> <br /> Being a family film I am surprised that they have brought in some things like fear and faith, especially if they also enjoy the entertainment of the American public. But who cares about what Yanks says, we feel the rocks! Doctor who has shown potential since then of the first episode of the new series in 2005, being the first severe damage to fear, from fun to hard, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans once said, "The old doctor who came back." <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
