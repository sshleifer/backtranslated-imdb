After seeing Dick Tracy in a $ 6.99 box at Future, I decided to give her a chance without previous knowledge but I'm a fan of Mafia movies and crime. I was very surprised to see a very entertaining movie with strong shows all the time. The film moves well, and of course has another strong performance from Warren Beatty, but the real highlights of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to know that Pacino had been nominated for his performance as the best gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was as wonderful as the girl in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you are dealing with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, intelligent film with a great representation and solid texts, try Dick Tracy. I do not think you'll be disappointed. Watch out for albums from Paul Sorfino, James Kane, Cathy Bates, Dustin Hoffman and others.
