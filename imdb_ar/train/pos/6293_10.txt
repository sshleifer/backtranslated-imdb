Puster shines absolutely in this episode, the only car I have seen near the end of the profession that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. The shock is still hearing his lavish voice in the speaker sequences - his voice revolves around the one thing I do not care about, the poster - but his ability to take nonsense is still unprecedented. He even repeats some of the masks he used early with two reels with Roscoe Arbakl. <br /> <br /> My sincere gratitude to Rud Serling for presenting us with this episode, and for giving the genius of the Full Range Bustier. He did not have enough time (one episode) to do this, but this is an impressive tribute to the greatest Hollywood genius.
