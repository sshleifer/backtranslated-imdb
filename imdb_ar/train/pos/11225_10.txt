What an amazingly good movie, it turned out that this film was. This is the kind of movie that I've been looking for over the ages. It was very important for me to have a wonderful Chicago, which I'm still thinking about. The back cover does not work on justice in this film, it's wonderful, and in my top 5 movies for sure.
