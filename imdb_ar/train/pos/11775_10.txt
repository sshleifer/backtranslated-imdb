This, along with "Hare Tonic", is rated as one of the best comics comics, and is already one of the best bugs, at all. There are some comments about how the errors in these drawings are "essential", which means, I think, that it has not yet fully developed. I actually prefer this "basic" version from the mid-1940s (Chuck Jones was the best version) which is actually much larger for the rabbit and much more enjoyable than the tall version crowned by Sam Yosemite and Daffy Duck. The bugs on the last day came to be very sophisticated and sophisticated to my liking. See also "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classical mistakes and the classic Chuck Jones.
