Simply put, one of the most popular movies I have ever seen. It is a parody of criminal life, a parody of everything that represents Chicago 1930. - There really is no need to underestimate the importance of this film because the rating is less than 5 years. Those who decide to watch it will regret it, and those who decide not to see it will regret it more.
