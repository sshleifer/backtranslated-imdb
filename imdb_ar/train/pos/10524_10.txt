Sure Jane Austen would approve this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow performs a remarkable act that embodies Emma's position. It's funny without being too silly, but elegant. (I'm not British myself, maybe not the best judge, but she fooled me ... She was also excellent at "Sliding Doors" ... and I sometimes forget she's an American!). <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, Sophie Thompson and Felida Lo (sister and mother Emma Thompson) are also wonderful as Bates women. They almost stole the show ... and Ms. Law does not have any lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
