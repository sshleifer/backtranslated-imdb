I knew that Paramount wanted to shoot this film with Rodgers and Hart, but he could not solve the copyright problems, so Burke and Van Hyusen, who wrote the most famous Bing Crosby songs, made a very impressive contribution. <br /> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film "fits Crosby as a glove" and I could not improve it. No, it's not Mark Twain's spelling, it's Bing Crosby, and in 1949 Crosby was Hollywood's most famous star. One time Paramount Technicolor was used and Ronda Fleming was never loved on screen. This was a woman who was invented Technicolor. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's origins are in Brooklyn, but they have a good comic effect. The Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his optimistic, patented philosophical figures with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song she sings once and for all on her own and with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for Best Song, but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It's also good that Bing managed to score the score for Deka with Ronda Fleming, Bendics and Hardwick. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's cartoon talent without Bob Hope. I liked Road photos, but Bing was a comic talent on his own and this film shows better than anything else. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
