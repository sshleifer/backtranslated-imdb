Wonderful movie! Slow: Yes. <br /> <br /> ... But I pray and the atmosphere is deep, dark and very terrifying, and it is quite strange (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would like to compare it to Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet, perhaps mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and a bare lunch (insects!). Also a little of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add some of Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a bit of Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's ladder, Parker The Forbidden and Salome - which must together form at least a dark night concept ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you are abroad for avant-garde and / or surrealistic films (like I) you would work like this one. If you expect anything else like a movie full of motion with some medium plot - try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Recent Words: The plot is very strange and unusual and this may be the # one reason most people dislike this movie.
