My heart breaks that this film is not appreciated as it should be. Its very underestimated. People forget about what the movies are really about, these days they only think about bum bum movies, which can be very fun with popcorn and friends, like transformers and directed films, with a very high budget like 300mln or higher, on special effects only and which are stupid movies Without a story. It's kind of like what I film though. Of course, it's fun to watch CGIs made great, but we do not gain anything essential from this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the performance was excellent. Especially Busy Phillips, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) make this film worth Oscar. The emotional performance by Philips was amazingly stunning, it was a shame that we would not see Oscar in her hands, she deserved it.
