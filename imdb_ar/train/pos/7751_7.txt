I really love AWTWB Tom Barman. Just let it come to you and enjoy it while you continue, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting on the cafe's terrace with beer, in the summer sun, watching people pass by. Definitely will not make you think later, that's true, but this is not a precondition for a good movie. It's just a great experience during the film. <br /> <br /> I felt there were a few strings that could have been solved a little more, but being a Lynch fan, I no longer care about this anymore :) <br /> <br /> I loved * Style, or tilt of this film. It's a spot, but new, and soundtrack is beauty. Any music lover will kick out of AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I will give you 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Music from 10 of 10))
