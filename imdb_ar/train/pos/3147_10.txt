This fabulous show has some of the best writing I've ever seen. It has a great direction by Dvid Trainer who also directed another intelligent TV series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the best shows. Such as THREE'S, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be on TV for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> From jokes designed perfectly to the great shows you might only dream of, this is a great show for people who lived in the 1970s and people who did not. This offer appeals to youth and young people at heart. Perfect view.
