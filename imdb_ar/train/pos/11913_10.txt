This is an excellent film for female universities and women's movement enthusiasts! I think Sue Price did a great job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and will of iron to resist the strong nebula (Nemesis 2). Although the film is not of great value and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best to meet him in my life, the film itself was wonderful, an invaluable jewel for women bodybuilding enthusiasts! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied through other famous science fiction movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but this is not the subject. The important point is that A.Puyn built in this film a very talented player who put all her energy and talent into the body to show us the best she could do. I really enjoyed this movie and watched it with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (the somewhat boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (the most interesting sequel of 3). O unfortunately did not appear yet on DVD :-(
