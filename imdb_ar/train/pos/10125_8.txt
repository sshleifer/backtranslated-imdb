This film is the first of the trilogy Triangle Miikes community, and a trio for a wonderful start. The films in the thematic trilogy are only objectively linked, and these are actually visible in all of his films, if you're looking closely. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to stop his little brother from getting involved with a gang of foreign extremists, struggling to get to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The child's brother is a lawyer, and the Trinity band is becoming increasingly in need of one, with the film progressing. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore very violent and difficult. Miike's performance has been worse, but since this film is dangerous, it hurts you so much. As usual there are also a lot of deviant sex, mostly gay in this sex. The film in many ways is a typical film gangs, but with a big drive and real sadness. If you've just watched the distant Miikes (Ichi the Killer, Fudoh, etc.), this is worth watching because it is a kind of compromise between his aggressive aggressive style and those of his most dangerous side, as we have seen in other three films. As always with Miike, there are at least two scenes you will never forget (see it and find out for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
