"How to lose friends and alienate people" is an entertaining, albeit loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoirs of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill out line requirements in IMDb reviews! The essential essence is the same book with dramatic certain events, but a romantic plot is added and the end is definitely Hollywood. Simon Pegg, though playing a basically annoying person, is himself the usual lovable and funny film holder and pretty much. It is strange to think only a few years ago, it was just a television series and is now rubbing shoulders with the names of Hollywood. There is a good support team which is an amusing and easy hour - kind of ugly guys "Betty", but more entertaining.
