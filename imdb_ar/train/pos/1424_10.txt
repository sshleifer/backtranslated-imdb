Rather annoying that the reviewers continue to compare this to "Planet Earth" ... of course * "Planet Earth" is better - it has much the same thing. Earth is like an extended section of the Planet Earth series, so it's the lowest and simplest. But this is not like what it looks like. <br /> <br /> As a documentary film (or actually something long), it transcends anything you will see to a great extent in your entire life (unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with long-range cameras for consecutive years, Extreme environments to identify the most unusual organisms on Earth, which - lets you face them - is unlikely). <br /> <br /> About the narration: Yes, everyone in the UK - including me a lot - loves David Attenborough, and there's no excuse for him not to tell here, but it's not worth hitting a star or three. I was not in advance of Planet Earth, but just a narrator, and I'm sure it's modest and cute enough to realize that anything that attracts more viewers is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by awe, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love it (ie everyone) will / should continue to buy Planet Earth. So, there are three cheers for their cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone who is cheap enough to buy this on a DVD instead of a box on the planet. But as artworks, they are not in competition here. <br /> <br /> The land is big enough for both of them.
