His wife, Felix Anger (Jacques Limon), has just been thrown out because he is one of the most nervous people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he can not seem to work, so go to his friends' house. Absolute Oscar Madison (Walther Matau) recently lives in the sky. Smoking, gambling, hitting chicks, eating out and never cleaning is his paradise. Well, with suicide attempts, Oscar decided to let Felix move on. In the beginning, it's a game made in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his money on time, but Oscar quickly wins women and Felix (probably a gay world) is not ready to move on. They claim two British birds and find Felix so thin that they soon remain with Felix and talk about his family life, leaving Oscar deprived. That is, he explodes and shoots him, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he seems, and soon has the upper hand. My favorite quote is "You leave me little notes on my pillow." I told you 158 times I can not stand a few notes on my pillow. " We all came out of corn chips. F.U. "It took me three hours to discover FU was Felix Ungar!" Based on Neil Simon's play (which also wrote a script), this has a certain theater character. Adjust and set the appearance and it looks like it's totally playable (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea movies. They represent the same hard / soft roles, but with different names (to avoid kings' problems, I'm sure). <br /> This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, and the strawberries are sweet, juicy and bright (unless you get those greasy bad). They are almost polar, but together, contrasts each other and makes a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/lcoformovies
