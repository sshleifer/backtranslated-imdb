Among the standard liner films, where the acting and logic are examined at the door, this film is at the top of the row. If the person in charge of casting has put "good" actors in this click, it would be worse (except for Richard Dawson who did really well, if you can call playing yourself "acting"). I like this film! Running is all too often the gift of God to man (well maybe men only). Certainly the most quoted film of our time, so I'll divide you into my favorite line: "It's all part of a rich lifestyle, and you're better off getting used to it." Ah, people have been called "Brenda" to quote this film more than I imagine.
