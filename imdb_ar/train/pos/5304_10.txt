Pecker is a funny but humorous movie about a small town in Baltimore that was broken by her daily routine by Pecker, a young photographer who captures images of "real things". No beautiful models, no gorgeous men, just live hard. This wonderful film harnesses the softness of the urban arts series. There is one special scene when a homeless woman shopping at Baker's Miles store buys the exact same meaning of a Whitney shop for just 25 cents instead of $ 500. This shows you that no matter what type of money you have, you may not always have a taste. Once again John Waters sends you an endless cycle of laughter and harsh reality. You can have mainstream Hollywood movies with special effects and celebrity mountains, but give me "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) on "Titanic" or "Godzilla" on any day !!
