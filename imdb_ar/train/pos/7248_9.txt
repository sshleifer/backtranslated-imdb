When I saw the 3000 year pesticides the first time, I had no expectations for this film. However, it was not as bad as I thought. It is a kind of Italian version of the Roadwarrior, with the cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story, Elissa Brigante and Dardano Sacete, who are also responsible for the story of zombie eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy, and you can see that child in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (AKA Gates of hell) like John Robbins and at the end of the world Cannibal as Mary's brother. Very enjoyable movie, with some boring parts.
