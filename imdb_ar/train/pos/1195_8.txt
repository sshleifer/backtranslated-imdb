I have watched this film for about twenty years in the late show. I still remember the film clearly, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I have always thought that Taylor was disdainful of him as an actor because most critics saw him as a strong and almost boring man, and women simply liked watching his movies because of his looks. This film, however, proved to be an interesting actor. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. He is quite a believer in a truly evil role. From what I read, he was a very industrious man who walked in real life and never fought for these kinds of roles. He basically will only do what MGM has given. This film proves that he could have dealt with more varied and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how it was the disturbing character of Lloyd Nolan. Nolan was a great actor, but this character was aggravated. The last scene of the film has been suspended with me all these years. This movie is definitely worth a look.
