I usually enjoy movies like "Chances Are", but I was not completely satisfied with this film for several reasons. The first half was generally well done, where Alex Finch died and was embodied in a new body (Robert Downey Jr.). He meets with his wife (Cybil Shepard) and his friend (Ryan O'Neill) and his daughter, who grew up now. The viewer meets them again and rediscovers Downey who was good, and there is a great deal of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes that her husband has been incarnated, but the film from there descends. There are many sex scenes that have stopped me completely, especially since Downey and Shepherd want to meet again despite their different ages. After that, however, the film could end up in the most satisfying way possible, given the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become immoral until the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in the sky were well done. There is a good song to be sung by Peter Citera and Cher, but the film is not wonderful at the end. For a better-looking movie, try "Heaven Can Wait". Decent, but I really wish I had not seen him because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
