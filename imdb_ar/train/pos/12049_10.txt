I was given this movie 10/10 with some hesitation because it is hard to praise something that has been chasing me and scared me for years. The enormous threat to women in the face of blacks is just pure horror, and accompanying music increases the state of awe. <br /> <br /> I saw this when it first appeared on the TV screen when I was 10 years old and it really bothered me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that many other users have said this too. Many movie reviews continue about the extent of the horror or horror of a movie, but you can believe everyone who posted on this forum, it's really incredibly powerful. I mean, I like horror movies and I find them funny in general, but this is really a threat and probably bothers most people. I have not seen him since I was 10 years old and was tempted to see him again, but I am afraid that I will spend some sleepless nights. I can not put my finger exactly as it is, but I think it's about the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we, as viewers, are as vulnerable as we are. Remarkably, the feelings of other viewers are unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing compares to this.
