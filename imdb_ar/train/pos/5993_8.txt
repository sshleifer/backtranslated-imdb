The Cure uses sound to create an intense mood. Although VO represents all lines of the film, it is surprising not to take away the visual story. Using multiple movie arrows adds a lot of texture to the story. The option of combining b & w and color works well to enhance leaps in time. Will eventually make you jump despite your ability to predict the outcome. I particularly enjoyed the suspense thriller. The close-up of the love scene is also beautiful and reflects a delicious eye. The piece is very short but it does a lot. Fine editing really helps to show what a short film can do. Worth seeing more than once!
