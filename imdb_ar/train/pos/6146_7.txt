Disney may have been hoping for another Mary Bubbins, but this is a completely different story. While Angela was happy, she was a singer quite different from the great Julie Andrews. Having said this Lansbury perfectly offers magical performance. There is something delicious about her character, and she enjoys the wonderful support of David Tomlinson. Tomlinson can hold a melody but he certainly does not cut as a singer. It does not matter that he is such a talented actor you hardly notice. There are some wonderful game of beloved stars at another time like Roddy McDowell, who performs well and Tacy Osia is much loved and does very little but it is good to see the old Gal again. It is also nice to see Sam Jaffy and English television king Bruce Forsyth in small roles. The result has several beautiful songs especially the wonderful sea and the age of non-faith. A large number of Portabello Road is extended to the maximum but has a lot of play. The effects are a bit sketchy today, but the scene in which the German invaders were attacked by the most violent army in the film is impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but one is struggling to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the march of the homeland army. The house keeper was very important to Britain and this is a hot honor. The animation is exhilarating, much better than the Pixar that I find ugly. A warm happy movie and his wonder was not on stage.
