Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with GODFATHER, add some Roman legends and lots of lowbrow comedy, and you have SOPRANOS, a clan of mobs operating out of northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as professional wrestling. I'm not one of the biggest fans of this show, but I'm very fond of Johnny James Gandolfini, Tony Soprano, a mentally ill with a glimmer of conscience at times. I also came to admire the contributions of people like the pebble Dom Chiancie as the stunning but deadly Uncle Jr., the silver-haired Tony Serico as Pauli in constant perplexity and the beautiful hands of Falco like the double-edged Karmella. The Soprano. Sudden violence and drawings, the number of bodies is rising steadily every season, but small moments are often the most important here. Christie Bowley and his nephew Tony (Michael Emperiol's late law and order) watched as they lost in Pine Barnes and sat on a bitter cold night in an abandoned vehicle, both of whom were convinced they had been exposed.
