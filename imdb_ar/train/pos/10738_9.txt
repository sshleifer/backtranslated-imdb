SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about attacks on French filmmakers WTC.2 in New York to film and take advantage of NYFD's actions. Before 9/11 nothing really happens, giving the film a terrifying scenario. On the day of the attacks, it seems just another dull day at work, but that will change soon. Where filmmakers walk along the road with firefighters shooting the first crashed plane, these are the only shots of the first impact. He rode with the firefighters to the World Trade Center and went into the building. When the second plane crashes people understand that this is not an accident. In the coming period, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile, we hear the sounds of noise. These are the voices of people who jumped out of the tower and fell to the ground. This is the harshest moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend runs for his life, you hear him breathing like a crazy man while running out of the building. Then a huge sandstorm exploded on him and the screen turned black. He was very lucky to survive, and now he could photograph the streets of downtown New York City. Since this documentary has a lot of historical footage and because the film was supposed to be something completely different, it is likely that this documentary will remain in everyone's memory. I have seen the attacks live at home because I spent the afternoon, making it more realistic to watch. 10/10
