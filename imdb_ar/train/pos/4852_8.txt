Now this is one of Big's Best, Jack Holbert's singles role was split in 1931 into two parts of the Askyon & Murdoch radio team. He has a strong team, who plays a leading role in everything he deserves, especially Askey's course. Lindre Travers, the melodious musicians by Herbert Lomas, and the historians of Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> A group of railway passengers stranded at the only rural station at night found more than they were competing for, and ghost trains. Spectral porters, sunny sausage rolls and Arthur try to entertain them all. His partner with everyone is between the side division and the dreadful end. When the formula works, it is very good, but sometimes it becomes very vexed and forced to make the film seem more dated than it is now. But these treacherous fifth columns - thank God, Britain did not get anything at the moment! <br /> <br /> In the end a nice harmless movie, to welcome back on TV as an old friend, but if you expect to tremble from your timber you are probably very disappointed!
