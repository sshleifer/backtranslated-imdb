All in all A good film and better to the fact that if the film was not produced, the story may remain hidden to the masses. Brosnan does a good job as an original American with an astounding past and stunning photography. For some, this may be very eccentric, for others boring - for me it's a nice and wonderful story and perfect for family viewing. Now this is not something you get much recently.
