This film answers the question, How does the relationship stay when your friend is self-reliant, clinging to her, needy, jealousy ... and has abilities and abilities that far exceed the capabilities of dead women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the movie, you can safely assure it is not, but there is great fun to be along the way. Uma Thurman is ideal as the super-lame heroine, the mysterious Abir girl, is named G-Girl, and unlike most of her sisters, she is not always devoted to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman can also be believed to be completely cloudy, but he still brings values, Jenny. When they are thrown to a less endearing competitor but are emotionally safer and well adjusted, G-Girl turns into projectiles, and the following is not nice. It's funny, but it's not beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure, hell does not have any anger like a busy, busy heroine, and the participants do not carry it exactly, but it has its moments, and I think I will get a DVD. <br /> <br /> Like this movie ..
