A delightful piece of cinema novel in a simple yet effective way. Cinema in the end is a visual medium and Igor used his full potential. A restless young man riding a train without a destination in mind. In one of the compartments meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged but laundry is washed from there and we are taken on a trip with characters and other strange positions. The presentation threads are thrown perfectly because their unique features tell you a story that does not need words.
