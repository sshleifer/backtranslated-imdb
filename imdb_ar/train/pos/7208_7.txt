The playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Main's brilliant) would have been killed because of a successful blow. Enter the little boy Wonderland (strong countryside) who just wrote such a play. Drove to Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (played wonderfully by Cannon) and a German psychologist (Eren Worth is very funny) and you've got a wonderful funny suspense click. <br /> <br /> While not hitting "Sleuth", "Deathtrap" is no less able to ride in a thrilling comedy thriller, based on a brilliant play by Ira Levin. It is clear that artists spend a day field with materials, with Caine offering in particular first-class lines with Gusto. <br /> <br /> The film loses a little steam in its middle, and the finish is much less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall the "Deathtrap" is solid, well behaved and pleasantly thrilling.
