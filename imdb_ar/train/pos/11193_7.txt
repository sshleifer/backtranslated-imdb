I loved some kind of single lady. Give Bea a break. It looks fantastic and has really beautiful eyes. What do not you like? The scene in which Ray Liotta was raped with a garden hose was cruel and cruel. In fact, there are a lot of things happening in this gross and harsh film. But in a trivial film. Too many abandoned films are not all bad. I liked this better than the Valley of the Dolls, which was not only dirty but also boring. At least, this was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia is completely naked and appears to be a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a young man three times a year is unbelievable. I'm sure that Pia is a nice person in real life, they do not give up the character of the writer. She seemed happier when she was the host of Saturday Night Fever and dressed in a bright disco dress. <br /> <br /> A couple of funny scenes. The person who tells the time actress that she is pregnant and rolls his eyes and is attracted to her "to stop hanging around!" , While it fits in practically with every Bembo that disappears. <br /> <br /> The scene of the nervous collapse of Pia is good. It may have been a mistake to go to the supernova (the whirlpool of floating faces and the scream of the frosty frame - stand!) <br /> <br /> The acceptance letter is shouted, anyway. I want to see someone doing this in a dramatic chapter. <br /> <br /> But again, this is trash we're talking about. You could find the worst in any movie of the week back in the eighties.
