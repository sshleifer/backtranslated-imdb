I saw it several times before I left the scene. A wonderful and fun movie with some of my favorite stars. Just wish I could find it again! Definitely will buy / watch if you can. Please, someone, bring it back. Fred McMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and the leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially Jun Haver, were beautiful and charming. He was a musician, but romantic, funny and intelligent. This was my favorite film of June Haver, though I always loved it. Her dazzling smile lit up on the screen, and her beauty and talent were the assets of any film. Support cast credit lend to their individual roles. Balanced and light hearted film. Wish we had more like it!
