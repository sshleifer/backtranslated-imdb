Someone is releasing the movie on a DVD so that it can replace its sacred place as one of the greatest films of all time 10 to 20 years ago when critics and film historians look at the so-called 1990s movies and see how often they were unhappy, Von Trier revolutionized and revitalized the world of international cinema. As it is, "Zentropa" (or "Europa" as it is referred to outside the United States) is one of the most creative and creative views on the depression and quasi-mental uncertainty that spread from post-World War II Europe, the shabby German landscape. Whose physical horrors were met only by the harm done to her family. Von Trier paints brilliantly his vision on the screen. You'll feel like you've seen some of the classic spy games lost since the late 1940s with completely black and white scenes lit up, while at the same time you feel like you're on the edge of something beyond the edge, especially in scenes like the murder on the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you experience the evolution of an artistic form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, von Trier fell into his faith shortly thereafter. While "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are classic in their own right, it is Zentropa that has really brought the art of filmmaking to new heights. 10/10, ages like good wine, begging for a DVD version.
