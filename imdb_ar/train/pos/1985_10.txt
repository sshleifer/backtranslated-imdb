I'm not a fan of musicals, but if I had to choose what my favorite would be Oliver. This is a well-made, well-formed, well-formed, well-formed film with good songs, my favorite being "Ronnie Moody's Review of the Situation, which offers a wonderful picture of Vagin." I was not old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 1960s, So for a few weeks at the end I had to carry with them the singing of bloody songs, usually "Who would buy the wonderful roses - I already knew all the songs before I saw the film. He is an immortal musician that he has certainly not been able to remake. He stands on his own. It is not accurate for the book and I do not think it would have worked well if it had been. I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as Oliver wrote to portray poverty in London, the orphanages and the role of work and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, and the film portrayed very well. Another great reason to watch this film is the Bullseye the Old Bull English terrier, and noted its long, thin legs. They have been raised for many years. They must have been high and low hunters to find a sample like Hu, exactly what it would look like. In Victorian times. Note that he suffers from scars (possibly makeup) on his face and may have been used by Bill Sykes in dog fighting or in a rat hole. Trier had a record number of dead in a rat hole. He is a lovely dog ​​by no means and notes that he disobeys Bill Sykes after Nancy is killed, and obviously he has his standards that he believes that its boss Bill Six is ​​not the head of the piece. Great music to see if you like musicals, if you do not like musicals, try them anyway, there's something for everyone in this movie.
