I remember Casper's comic books, but I do not remember any cartoons. Perhaps they were not memorable. I do not know but at an advanced age, I'm watching this short Casper movie yesterday. After that, I was shocked to read user comments here. Have people missed the end? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like other ghosts, who want to go out every night and scare everyone. "Does not see any future in that," according to the narrator here. Instead, one evening he goes out to the rural section of the city, accidentally scares some animals and finds no friends. He moves him to tears, until he hears a little fox yell at him and catch him. The two became friends but soon, the fox ran for his life with the fox chase in progress. <br /> <br /> All other reviews have reported what is going on, so I'll go over it too. The fox was killed by the hunting dogs (undeclared) and Kasper in tears for his loss "the only friend I own". But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Singular" The fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumps on his knees, tails his face and hangs the narrator "They have lived happily ever after". Both cases seem overwhelming. <br /> <br /> What's sad about that? This is a nice story with a nice happy ending.
