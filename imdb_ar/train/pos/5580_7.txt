A beautiful young man Eva (Hedy Lamar) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he can not sexually satisfy her and ignore her. Frustrated I went home and plans to get a divorce. Then, one day, she was dipping into a lake in the middle of the forest. Running her horse in her clothes ... and then run away! Meet the very handsome young Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and realize that this is the man you want. <br /> <br /> Finish the spoiler !!!! Of course, since this was done in 1933, it must be punished because of its sin until it leads to a tragic end. End spoiler finish !!!! <br /> <br /> This panic struck people in 1933, but it was tame in accordance with today's standards. Lamar's bare swim does not show anything, and when the horse runs after the nude completely, they appear either in a very long shot or covered with such branches. There are only a few simple shots of her breasts. Also when you have sex with Mog, it shows nothing but her face but you see that she is achieving orgasm. These looks were considered very extreme in their day and were completely cut off from the American release. Now they are back now. This PG-13 movie will now end easily. <br /> <br /> The shock rings aside, that's fine. He was beautifully photographed and there is no dialogue. Except for musical score, this may be a silent picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog are special and they are so attractive that they take your breath away watching them. The sequence with which they make love is easily one of the most beautifully filmed and filmed series I've ever seen in a movie. The symbolic symbolic scenes (a few of them) are unfortunately sad today. I've already started to laugh during one! <br /> <br /> So, the great direction, the beautiful pictures, the attractive actors, the good behavior everywhere - but I was not very satisfied with them. I found that the film was slow paced (beautiful pictures do not make up a picture of me), rather dull, clear, static and had a negative end. I can live with the end, but it does not relieve the other problems I have encountered. Also the final sequence is really weird - and out of place. So I admire this film more than anything else. I have been well recommended but done with caution. It seems a lot of people like this movie, so I'm a minority. Use your judgment.
