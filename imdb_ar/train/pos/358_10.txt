The Color Purple revolves around the struggles of life and love that help those who are deeply affected by the struggles of life. Each character had a purple element in it. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred and triumph. Whether Sally was living in hell and lost her sister, and entered a marriage in her life to show her love again, Albert was not a man correct his mistake towards Sealy, and her father ignored her and finally admitted Sophia and her stubborn good and bad, even my intention, they had gaps and hardship during the film, It was finally overcome, this is a sign of a good film. Good job for all cast and crew.
