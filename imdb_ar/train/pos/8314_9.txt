The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a group of famous girls. In their endeavors, the eldest sister meets a drug dealer and a street hustler named Satine, followed by Sister because she believes it is a "big time" that will give her everything she thought she wanted from life. Although he can be accused of killing her, he only kills her spirit and will to live, and then becomes addicted to drugs and eventually dies of overdose. The story does not revolve around the life of the Italian street or mob that is trying to buy Stix, and then threatens it. It is how love can overcome the worst tragedies of life as portrayed in the song, elegance and personality that life was in times for young women trying to "discover" at the time.
