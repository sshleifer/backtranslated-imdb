This film is really special. It is a very beautiful film. Who started with three orphans, Shaw, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, then they managed to live and buy a house. They make new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong, they became enemies, and ended up killing each other. <br /> <br /> I was negatively about this film at first, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - the Taiwanese singer) are trying to become actors, but this is not like other actors - movies. They do a great job, without previous film experience (except for Lee-Hom, who was in two films before). <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies. Maybe this is a bit because I am very impressed with Hyde, but - it was this film that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - Xu Orphan) was part of the group who wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play friend Xu, Vampire Ki. At that time they did not know each other, at least not like friends. But after the film they became a really good friend, and this also shows us that they worked hard in this film and they cooperated well. <br /> <br /> The film has many different emotions that come from the story, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's very beautiful. After people die, Ki leaves and everything changes a lot. But this is still a wonderful film, it's the only movie that made me cry at all, and it ends up very sad, but it's still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you do not see this movie, you should do so. Because it is wonderful, but sad. You will not regret. ^^
