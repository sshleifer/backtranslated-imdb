I do not know stars, or modern Chinese music in my teens - but I know a movie that is quite enjoyable when I see one film. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is a pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is played for laughter, for love, a wonderful combination of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to have had a lot of fun doing it - production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks more glamorous than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The orphaned orphanage that grew up in a Kung Fu school to be expelled only and the discovery of superstars as a basketball play (and love and more); it is a wonderful game, fun and great amusement. <br /> <br /> Thanks to great work and good dialogue, this is just enjoying all ages - and our money was one of the best family movies we've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Donk an opportunity - we were really pleased - a good sports comedy.
