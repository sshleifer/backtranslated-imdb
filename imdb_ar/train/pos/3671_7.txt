Hollywood North is an express expression of the film industry where they went to Canada to produce films because of tax exemptions and cheaper costs in a civilized city such as Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver. It is possible that Peter O'Brien, the director, saw many invaders from California that this film seems to be the right way to deal with the coming characters that are trying to take advantage of the economy provided by Canada. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern," the successful novel by a Canadian author turned into a "Journey to Bogot√°," which has nothing to do with the original film. Michael Betis, obsessed with what is happening in Iran, has been shown to be a big cockroach, offering the leading part, which turns into a disaster. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film says that many have spoiled the smelly cooks, which seems to be the case with the final product, which is kept by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who was working on a documentary about the film filmed in Toronto, parts of the film turned into a coherent film in the end. <br /> <br /> The shooting process is fun, and acting, in general, is good.
