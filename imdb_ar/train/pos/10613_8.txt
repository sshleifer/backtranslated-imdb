This is a lost horror jewel for a long time starring Sydney Lasek ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it is worth it. This movie is creepy but cheesy at the same time. Three young women (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) appear to be traveling to the small city of Solvang, California, to cover a festival when a mix of their hotel room takes place and goes to the home of Ernst Keller and his ex-wife Virginia. Vicky remains behind him and feels sick because the other two will not tell their story. She was quickly killed in the house, in a very cheesy way by an unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (her head was cut through the closed lid of the vent where she collapsed on her while she was being bulldozed to the basement). Karen will soon return, killing more brutally by repelling her face through the vent hood. Jennifer is fighting with her lover (former?) In a somewhat boring sub-plot, and when she returns home, her hosts (whom we have now discovered a brother and sister and everything downstairs is their son) plot to try to kill her as well. Virginia does not fully agree with Ernest's plan to kill Jennifer but is deceived to go down to the basement where he meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comedy because Junior (hysterically filmed by Stephen Forrest) is distorted, suffers from mental deficiencies, and causes his actions and movements in some of the game's laughs, although it is supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the film goes up and the finish is done well. Actresses / actresses do a great job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although it's not the most terrifying film ever, it's a very entertaining movie!
