This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they were showing a Yugoslav film every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week, there was another fantastic movie (including a train, not a bus) a name I can not remember. If you know it, please let me know! In any case, how can I watch this movie again ??? DVD to this movie, where? Please tell me about vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The next week, there was another wonderful movie (including a train, not a bus) that I can not remember. If you know it, please let me know!
