When we started watching this series on the cable, I had no idea how addictive it was. Even when you hate someone, you are preventing you from developing because they are so beautiful, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation in the way they do. It looks as if the viewer is facing one of Christopher's educational curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana will deal with Christopher's abuse of her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I should just read the newspaper to see how many women can do and accept this behavior. Carmela has a dream home and an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she will give up a loving and fulfilling husband - or maybe not. That's why I watch. <br /> <br /> It does not matter how many times you see a loop, you can find something you missed in the first five times. We even watch the episodes out of sequence (watch Season 1 late at night with commercials but all languages, A & E with censored language, reruns movie network) - wherever they are, we're here. We have completely spoiled it now. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "Albacor around my neck" is my favorite Johnny Boy. When these jewels enter the vocabulary of our family, it is a sign that I must get a life. I will do when the series ends, I have collected all the DVDs, and put the set at my will.
