Here is a rare gem for those of you who have never seen or probably never heard of it. During the 1980s, Dennis Quid was a hot commodity, but in the early 1990s, Dennis Quid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all unfortunately bombed. Two of those films I liked a lot, let me touch one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy flick about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), are ... The Beginning of Fire: Yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder decided not to use his power anymore (for nothing to do anyway) after a fatal accident in his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house that killed a man inside whom he was not aware of. Today, Wilder is a fireman and married to angry Vida (Debra Wenger), who is under house arrest for some reason, I guess, what happened? Wilder has also not spoken with Wallace since 5 years, because Wallace caught fire during the single party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his thermal power and uses it for fun. He also runs a carnival and is a clown. When the carnival comes to Wilder, Wallace decides to meet with his brother and also to see Vida, whom Wallace loved! The house arrest Vida sees its end, but Wilder is busy. So, Wallace's steps start to fun. Brother vs my brother ... Fire fighting with fire! <br /> <br /> Some wonderful fireballs throw in this song singing acapella songs during fire battles and after the wings. Jim Varney (universally known as "Ernst") emerges as a friend of the fallen Wallace carnival. The film "Wilder Napalm" was filmed brilliantly ... and cleverly put together ... very far from the wall and the extruder. <br /> <br /> Give this theme ...
