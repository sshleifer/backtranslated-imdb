Best description of this film or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton). But it is less funny and more you face a tale. Of course, this is not the father, but it is his grandfather who tells the stories. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is also moving forward and backward (so the storyline here in IMDb may tell you more than you want to read, before watching the movie). It is fun and attractive enough, although you move from story to story and have some exciting moments as well. It also surprises you here and there, with things you would not expect. A cute little movie then, deserves your attention, especially if you love movies like this! : s)
