Perhaps the last film you expect is from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which the film is based). It is a real fantasy, a kind of contradiction, really. An old woman finds a child in a cabbage patch and raises him as her son. After a few years, the child is a young boy (called Tutu) and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to an orphanage, and when he is 18, he leaves. Immediately, he finds that he has no home. Tutu is optimistic, and will not let anything drop him. A man steals his death, and instead of being angry at her, Tutu becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small tin town. Tutu takes some initiative and organizes many homeless people in the area and they build a better tin town. Soon, the landowner tries to sell this plot of land, and the citizens of the city of huts must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner carries a police force to get rid of the displaced. At this stage, the film becomes a complete fantasy (before this was the most melodramatic comedian / fabulous in style Charlie Chaplin). These things are so strange and amazing that it is better for others to see them themselves. It is very amazing, and very funny. There are objections that may be raised about the miracle conspiracy in Milan, certainly. Fellini and Visconti were strongly criticized as they began to move away from new realism. I think I read that this has been widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, it's very enjoyable - I loved it so much. This may be my favorite in Vittorio de Sica's films, although both Umberto De and The Beagle approached. 10/10.
