The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was that he was on the top 100 list in AFI. In fact, I had to find it hard to find a copy, and got a DVD copy for half the price. Surprisingly it was only rated on the M15 + (unpolished version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will care about this review (more like commentary) so I will make it brief. <br /> <br /> This may be one of the strangest films I've seen, partly because of montage, art photography (the art house too) and the unusual theme. There are so many things in the film I still do not understand (I've seen her twice), and she makes an emotionally confusing film. <br /> <br /> Photography and acting was very good, and it is better than the life characters that make this movie memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a "cowboy" from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. Meets with Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo's paralyzed intruder, and of course they become friends who run away normally. What makes the movie fun is that the two are completely different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo to the audience so he has no real emotional relationship, although the end is certainly very sad and tragic. You may already know what is happening by reading reviews, but it is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the film explores its themes in a beautiful and touching way. Deprivation of humanity (shown through the darkness of the city's streets and broken houses). Most of the characters in the film are outside the law (Kunman, giggolo.etc) However, you can not help admiring them. Joe Buck is gracious because he is very naive and optimistic, while we began to feel sorry for Ratsu later in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the film was rated highly because it was certainly very founding period. At that time (and so far) it was certainly not a typical film (house of art altogether). While the West dominated the cinema, the musicals and dramas performed a film with an unusual theme such as Midnight Cowboy. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I must say that I loved the film completely. The quality pictures were like a dream. I particularly liked the scene at the concert, the music, pictures etc remain in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a film for entertainment it was somewhat lacking (and not really my style of film) in the excitement. It's a movie that needs to be tasted and appreciated, instead of flicking off the cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> Although I hardly consider myself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motivations were very interesting. From my memories of the past, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although he still seems irrelevant to the story. He is a lucky young lover, suppressing his gloomy memories. The religious connotations in the film are puzzling. Some suggested an abnormal relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I failed to know where they came from. Homosexuality was not generally discussed in their conversation, and then Joe Pack met with a lonely old man, but had nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films in the decade (having more than 70s felt by more than 60s feel) is revolutionary while touching on subjects that have not done very few other films to do. Although it contains a simple emotional story (hidden through a solid edge), the beauty of the film in a strange sequence is often psychedelic.
