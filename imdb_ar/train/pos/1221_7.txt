For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. Well last summer, I saw them together and decided I was wrong. The first is the best Care Bears movie (as you might consider reading my rating). This film is not a bad film, it's just ... very strange. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as a few people mentioned, it completely ignores any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another complement that goes against the original version blatantly (especially with the qualities of some characters and how they all met). When I was young and watched this, I was a bit confused and tired. I felt the same way I see her as an adult! <br /> <br /> About the reasons why the movie is really good (if separated from the first movie). I can not think of another movie for young children with DEMON because it's wicked! Now I'm not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal camp spirits and bears are good, I find it wonderful to have something wonderful in a movie for young children! It's like the amazing "Santa Clause vs. Satan" from Mexico that you hear about. <br /> <br /> In any case, the name of the devil is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get "caring for the bears" in return for giving her special powers. Too dark for the flick erh? Did you mention that Darkheart often appears to the girl as an old 10-year-old voice? Horrible! At the same time, there are some other children in Care-a-Lot taking care of Baby Care Care! Hey man! Devils and Bear Care in the same movie !!!!! It goes without saying that everything is finally wiped out (but not before we can see a Darkheart movie that catches the souls of caring bears in this scary thing in the chandelere in a very disturbing scene [amazingly]. About this film that found the audience of worship it deserves, I may see it again by myself.
