I went to see this as if I and my lady had other things to do on a Sunday afternoon, and I loved the movies that deal with the shaky and lost characters and this is full of Im. After a slow start, we get some good turns from the cast, but the actual "Bellini" that produces and exits the film. 'Bellini' is one of the most extreme scenes I have seen in a film for a long time but it is very short and can make this overall masterpiece 71/2 out of 10
