This is the best individual program offered by Eddie Murphy at his best. Just forget the brilliant professor and the esteemed gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. Traditionally, (Pretending to be an anomaly) and Michael Jackson and other artists killers. I think it is also brave to ridicule artists who are very popular at the time. My favorite job is the place where an annual BBQ party is held with the family and his drunken father plays with his aunt the rabbit who falls from the stairs. <br /> <br /> This offer is the best medicine when you feel comfortable if you watch the "Raw" sequel do not disappoint me. It's very very good but does not match "rave."
