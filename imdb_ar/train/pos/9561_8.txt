"Ranma" "is anime favorite by Romiko Takahashi. Women really know how to entertain us with a good story, not just comedy, but also action comedy. The main character of the story is Ranma Sautumi, a teenage boy, also a martial arts expert, Ranma is engaged to Akani because of an arrangement for both parents, who are great friends and have been trained together for many years. Tindo's sister: Kasumi is the oldest and she is very sweet and Nabeki is the middle and loves making money no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akani fight all the time, especially because they are both very bad when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when he splashes with cold water and also becomes his father Panda, many new characters and situations begin to occur, and they discover the reason for the transformation: , Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river, but not only those injured ... If you see "Ranma 1/2" and loved, I recommend "Inuyasha" and "Mizon Ekoko", two other good creations from Hands of Romeo.
