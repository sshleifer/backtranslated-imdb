Note: spoilers inside. This wonderful film "revolves around" many things, all successfully: travel through scientific time, unstable psychology, quarantine society, what syndrome is real, progressive undermining of belief systems, bioterrorism worldwide, and the emerging love story. <br /> <br /> The fallout from the twisted timeline of the story has sparked a lot of heated debate - see the discussions within this site; or, as a maximum, check the message at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! This time focus often speaks to the brilliant plot, which comes from the wonderful work of the book David and Janet Peebles, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's "La Gitte". Without a doubt, this is one of the most successful time travel films ever made. But there are many other levels that are talking here. <br /> <br /> The real genius of the film is to focus on the bad side effects of time travel in James Cole's mind (Bruce Willis, who does the best job in his career here). His journey from the vaccine-hunting warrior to the victim who has not been phased out? And back again. The other major campaign of the story further emphasizes the personal story between James and Dr. Kathryn Riley (Madeleine Stowe). I love the views of the transformation / opposition simultaneously of these characters. For me, everything comes in the fleabag hotel room scene. From this point, James? Once gripped by hard torque? Now back in doubt about his reality; while Dr. Riley? The world is cool and rational? He finally became quite convinced, after grasping James' evidence, with his terrible predictions. Showing her desperation to reach James and cling to the mission to what extent she had reached it. <br /> <br /> Gillam makes us care about these characters, especially through the rising tension that is shaping their lives. The balance between the emotional cylinder and the science fiction / excitement is superb. The failure at the airport is very heartrending because we see it clearly coming through James' dreams. Is it here, after James decided to end the whole mess? And fighting madness more than ever before ?? He retreats to the dish and does what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and Venice? (A little while ago, the references to Hitchcock and the identity switch / confusion were wonderful.) This is a film that must be segmented by people who think; it not only stands up to repeated views, but demands them. "Twelve Monkeys" are clever, provocative, strange, funny and impressive things. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, especially Brad Pitt steals all his shows and shows great flexibility like Jeffrey Goynes, mad and spoiled, but ever survivor. There is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting how the film simply leaves the viewer his evil motives) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Gwynes. But the biggest awards go back to Terry Gilliam, barely surpassing Brazil. (Many similarities, of course, especially the only fighter trying to escape from his dilapidated surroundings: insanity at home, insanity without him.) Each frame of this film has its own unique character and tone. The soundtrack is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is one of the great achievements of the 1990s, my real favorite, and it will certainly last for a long time to come.
