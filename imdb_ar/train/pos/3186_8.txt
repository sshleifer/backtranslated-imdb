I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easy to digest, the humor is light and clean, and because the story of the story involving the wrong identity is very common, I find myself looking forward to knowing how this film comes out of this story. Turns out to be very nice. Female lead performance is wonderful. Her portrayal of an innocent and na√Øve girl trying to fabricate some white lies for David's role was very charming. I also find Vera dancing very good. I find myself fond of her toes as she talks about the theater effortlessly and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who have enough movies full of words today, you will enjoy this movie perfectly.
