First of all, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of the SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good film, but the problem is that everyone connects Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new borders. This REVOLVER movie is different from kidnapping. It's much darker and very complex. The reason I was given a 10 rating is that I had to watch the gun 3 times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It is written intelligently. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. I've been so wonderfully done, the cinema is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy's personal touch Ritchie (style of output) in them. <br /> <br /> What I imagined was the complexity of the protagonist and how we leave more questions than answers.
