I saw this in the theater during its initial release and it was disturbing because I'm sure it will remain. That was the first part of 68 and it's still touring cities all over America, and there was a mass murder in my hometown recently where I saw this where a man went in a shooting incident. The freshness of this near-home event coupled with this real drama story designed for a very disturbing play experience. She has really brought life to the excellent representation of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on the real event by Truman Capot and the scenario and direction of Richard Brooks, both of whom spun the event and Truman's interpretation of an attractive film adaptation. The music from Quincy Jones records her story effectively. I've only seen this several times since then. It was very real. Almost like being a witness to the same crime and riding along with the killers. I would like to give this 9.0 out of 10. It is possible that society is very sensitive to violence and crime today, which may seem slow and compromising and can be seen with less impact, but for anyone over the age of 50, that would be the hallmark of the criminal examination Spirit.
