drilling! Funny, fun, entertaining, interesting, elegant, and well done. Knowing that this meager budget has been prepared over the course of 7 years, it is amazing that this story can be listed, especially with this method and content. If you're a music lover or a documentary fan, that's a must. <br /> <br /> Focus on The Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a great way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets moderate success through perseverance and ability to compromise and a massive funeral lead singer backed by a variety of characters Whose success is undermined by drugs, alcohol and insanity. If I did not know that these footage were real people, you'd swear it was a very well written and creative piece. The story is compelling, concise and simply surprising.
