When a actor is forced to play the role of actor, fictional or realistic, the task becomes more difficult than playing a role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman passed himself off as Anthony John, the tormented double character. Put in that character all his talent and sincerity. The expressions of the face, behaviors, walking and attitude spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on the stage. Coleman also did a very good job as Shakespeare's representative in such short scenes as Othello, who was part of the film's jewel. The Clausops of Colman's face was also tortured by Othello because of suspicions about the sincerity of Desdemona's own scenes worth seeing. In addition, the desperation of his character outside the theater and only a person has the depth of Coleman in perception perception can achieve. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but this dual role was more profound and influential. Shelley Winters looked beautiful, small and brilliant at the same time and added her talent to the film. Ronald Coleman is believed to have liked his role in this film, first of all, he played and won the Academy Award for best actor in 1947. I've seen this movie over and over and do not feel bored.
