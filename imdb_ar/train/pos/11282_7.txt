It was the second of Tarzan's six classic films, featuring Johnny Wismuller as starring and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this was a great film in this series; perhaps the film "BIN" is in progress, which can be an example of the evolution of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it has shown good speed, but not the same quality as subsequent movies. Similarly, cinematography is less accomplished than the most recent Tarzan films in this series. The stock I saw was of varying quality, with some of the favorite scenes and some scenes at risk and overly exposed. Lacking a clear display of subsequent Tarzan films. On the other hand, there was one scene, very early, in which the intermittent camera movements with foliage swayed in front of her as the camera backed up, showing the men of safari moving into the forest, and was in fact almost new. Elegant, and strongly contrasted with the stills that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, one of the interesting features here was the proximity of a gene of volatility and instability, when it was subject to Martin's sparrows. Kiss ?? Jin stunned, partially guilty, reaction ?? Predicts something of a gene we see in the future as well as in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Finds a Son! Jin's double acts deceive Tarzan and take Boy to his family. Later she confessed to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, there is nothing quite clear, but we have Jane "dating" Jane Parker from yesterday, and in a series of acts of penance almost stripped herself of the evening gown that Martin and Harry brought to tempt her away from Tarzan. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of images and sequences that amazed me particularly in this show. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the picture we get about the local life of Turzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idealism with always near death potential. This to me is the essence of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some very violent scenes even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan driving the elephants to the Elephant Valley cemetery; Tarzan being rescued from the watery death by the hippo, and then feeding the monkeys to health; the leopard would find Tarzan when she surrounded Jane And the other men at the foot of the shelf. The leopard in particular crossing the river on the record. Scenes of the final battle of monsters and black on earth and monsters and monkeys in the trees. Jane, show us that she is really from the world of Tarzan now, and quickly introduced her wooden adventure craft to work on the line of fire to drive away the lions. <br /> <br /> The last series of scenes is wonderful: Suddenly Tarzan is on the scene, throwing the barbarians out of the trees and taking over the lions, summoning the elephants to save them! Those last cry of Tarzan in triumph, with a happy Jane in his arms, with leopard dancing and cheer beside them, is an unforgettable picture and a really good summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful Tarzan classic film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
