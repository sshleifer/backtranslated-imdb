For someone who remembers Jane in an animated film for the Daily Mirror, watching this movie is a nostalgic exercise. It's great in this context, but the young viewers will undoubtedly find comedy and missing actors as cartoon characters. The drawing line represents a slight handicap for today's audience, but it reflects the naivet√© of the 1940s and the 1940s very well. You must remember that Jane was part of the fugitive imagination of the war years, which was created to strengthen the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the "ribbon" animation. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Ryder Haggard. The subject could have been familiar to readers of that era, where a handful of disaffected Nazis were frustrated by a few equally humble Englishmen, and they were placed in the African jungle of course. <br /> <br /> For Jane's fans, you should see. For the rest of you, a wet irony. <br /> <br />
