This was a categorically sure of fire if they chose "almost anyone else" for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, play, tear, etc. It stinks. It seemed as though at some point Breadshan realized that too, and he often made him jumps like a monkey in order to make his individual scenes a bit funny. <br /> <br /> It's the only noticeable drawback (there's a pair of the most annoying bits) of a far hilarious movie otherwise. The best comedy comes in Bollywood since Hongama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a circumstantial comedy on the shoulders of a great screenplay and of course Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance yet. It is best to be the best comedian in every award job. The AK has always been good at comedy, but it takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and the way in which each line is presented. It's a genius performance. It was a theater full of fun throughout the film and I do not think I saw such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the USA. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala You do not have one "lead" heroine. It's 3 stars + incredibly hot beautiful girls who thought it did a pretty good job. Sure they are all doing the first thing. Parish Rawal is as solid as usual, although his routine wears off after a while. Rajpal Yadav is the same annoying model (tired of his outstanding actions in every film). Remy Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> In general, definitely worth the deco. I would say it is more fun than not getting in, and this is a lot. Perhaps it would be better if they chose someone more efficient than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
