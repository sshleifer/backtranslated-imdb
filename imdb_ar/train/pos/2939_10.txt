Eddie Murphy is one of the most extreme comedians ever - perhaps the most entertaining. Delirium is the best comedy list ever, I have never seen it and it is a necessity for everyone who likes to laugh well !! I have watched this film hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still enjoy the lateral division. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you will have to watch it several times until you hear all the jokes because you will laugh a lot - so you will not miss half of it! Delightful delirium! <br /> <br /> Although there are plenty of funny comedians out there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will look like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - get it, watch it - and love it !! It will make you more noisy! :-)
