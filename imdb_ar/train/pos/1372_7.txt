The "Party Party" benefits from the enormous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the film seems a way that allows Ms. Posey to play it herself, because it is usually in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy von Schirler Meyer, is a pleasure for Ms. Bossi's fans. Ms. von Schierler Meyer takes us on a road trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this spirit of no purpose that dedicates her life to enjoying the different clubs frequented by her. This era is still more naive than that region and has become adjacent meat market areas. At least, there are no excuses in films, and we see people on earth following their lives in a natural way, if we can call them that way. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey that we enjoy the film more than if another actress played Mary's role. The picture is complete. The rest cast is good.
