The 1960 Bewitched television series is credited with the idea of ​​this film. This is a film made by Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak directly after they were filmed together in the Vertigo movie by Alfred Hitchcock. This film is not so obsessed, but Novak is also attractive. <br /> <br /> This film was Jack Lemmons X. He is good at supporting here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The film has a lot of good things about it. Hermin Gingold is very good in this film, as she was good at supporting here just like she was in The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This film has the character of New York City in the late 1950s, a cat like any cats in any film. It is worth seeing because it is a love story with every person's feelings, and very little charm. <br /> <br /> It's not the Vertigo game, but I think it followed this movie, and then the viewers did not do it as well as they deserve - I'm certainly happy that William Asher saw it, until the 1960s series was created. I'm not happy with what Veril did on the big screen, this film is much better than that.
