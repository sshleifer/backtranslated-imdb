What a delightful movie. The characters were not only alive but vivid, reflecting daily life and discord within the family. Each character has brought a unique personality to the story that the public can easily associate with someone he knows within his family or circle of close friends. <br /> <br /> The story contains a real flow of real-life scenes that can be part of drama, laughter and tears and be part of the evolution of the film. The script well captures common feelings, actions, and reactions of characters for conflict, opinion, and determination. <br /> <br /> It's not epic, but it's very good to see it with my loved ones. Lots of head gestures and moments "ahhh" to share and enjoy.
