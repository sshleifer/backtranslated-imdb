"High Slaughter", perhaps, the brightest and most contemptuous flick in the 1980s. It is one of the few films of this genre that attracts everyone. However, they rely heavily on the standard slash: a group of young men and women are murdered one by one brutally until the final confrontation. <br /> <br /> The reason for "high slaying" is the top film in this genre is that it goes over the top. Marty, the murderer, has a good reason to hold a grudge against his former colleagues. They shocked him as he stood naked during the shower in the girl's locker room, and rushed into the crotch with the spear, and falsified his experience in the science lab so that they could disfigure him. <br /> <br /> The victims in this movie are almost as it is for you. When they meet after years - in the high school reunion that Marty has set up himself - you realize they have not matured much. They are a group of sociologists. <br /> <br /> It is puzzling to reason why they do not wonder why they are the only ones who attended the reunion, which, by the way, takes place in a school that has since fallen into a bad state. Who thinks it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor in the abandoned building in a room where old cabinets - as well as Marty's - are on display? There are many leaps of faith that viewers need to enjoy this film. The end is meaningless or nonexistent. The scriptwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works: the film claims that the joke is no longer allowed in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is one of the best examples of italics, despite all the disadvantages. It is difficult to understand why you did not find their way to the DVD, when there are a large number of vulgar clicks that run in the mill are awarded with special versions.
