I love this movie. The songs and story lines are great fun. The song "Say Goodbye" always moves me. What a wonderful thing to do to bring life back to the customers, in a way that you really care about these things made of cloth, cloth and whatever. Great sounds and great talent. Why were all the other puppet movies that came after this movie less interesting, moving and funny? Is this Mr.. Henson is just too lost?
