The fab animation was funny movie. The circus bugs, tuck / roll were very funny. If I waited until the end of the credits in the end, I saw a series of very funny films, where they showed mistakes that pretend to commit wrong acts as in other films, and that was smart because it made the characters more humane and sensitive.
