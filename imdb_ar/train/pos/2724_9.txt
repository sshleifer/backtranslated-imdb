Many of the classic films of the late 1960s did not maintain their ability to disturb and confront the public. "In cold blood" did not lose an ounce of its strength. Very well so far the viewer is forced to think. Some have complained not only of the film, but of the "non-fiction" of Truman Cabot's source, that the central message is inaccurate. This may be true, but this is certainly a case in which the ambiguity of the film does not diminish at all. It is refreshing, especially in view of the simple and deceptive moral dramas, to watch a film with a convinced political voice that is not afraid to force the public to look at its point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the central message of the film, but I admire his boldness nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the death penalty letter, there is much to admire. The representation of the two leads superb. Scott Wilson (still one of the most disdainful representatives ever) is chilling as a non-nationalist leader, someone who uses his attractiveness to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling as more than one subject to one and the other with conscience. Obviously his personality has the voice of reason, but it is terrified to contradict Wilson (there is a great deal of symmetrical symmetry by his character). Cinematography is wonderful and wonderful, but it gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic class from Quincey Jones, and have a masterpiece. (9/10)
