Ronald Coleman presents an impressive performance such as Tony John, a Broadway actor who can not separate his life outside the theater from Othello to Shakespeare, the character he plays on the stage ... There are two important scenes that illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first one happens in Max Lasker's product office. Acting is a matter of talent for the process. But Donnelly, Tony 's friend, disagrees: "No, no ... When you do it like Tony does it, it' s much more ... the way he enjoys becoming someone else every night. The entire system is not affected by it. ".... The other scene occurs in the apartment of waitress Pat Kroll. Tony tells her his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says, "Or Paul, Hamlet, Joe, maybe Othello." When Tony begins to train at Othello, we learn that although he tries to keep his real life separate from his play life, "the part begins to leak in your life, and the battle begins. He can not keep the two separate: in his opinion, Desdemona became an Othello, mistakenly believing that she was unfaithful to him. He killed her... The brave Coleman, in a complicated and difficult role, made an Oscar for best actor in 1947. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garrison Kanen for the best original screenplay. It should not be overlooked in filming Milton Krasner.
