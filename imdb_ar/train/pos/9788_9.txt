I was in the same scriptwriter and watched the movie. I thought the writer - Su Smith - clearly summed up what was the subject of the film. However, the film really needs no explanation. I thought the subjects were very clear and inspiring. The film, which deals with the ability to dare and confront fear - especially the fear that moves from the parents - and overcome it, and thus embraces the potential of life, a film that cherishes and enjoys. I enjoyed it more than just a "somersault". I also think that the Mandy62 was a bit odd for Hugo Weave. As a look at his wine, it must look very good! I agree that many Australian films have been dim lately, but "peach" delivers the goods. I'm glad to see him.
