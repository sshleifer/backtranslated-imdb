Seven Pounds plays Will Smith as Ben Thomas, the tax collector who has a hidden motive to meet those who are late in paying their taxes. Thomas killed seven people as he was leading the phone on his phone and the film follows his attempt to atone for his unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The story line is hidden like a green house window brick. What you see is exactly what's going on - until the end of Titanic was more surprising compared to seven pounds. There is no evolution at all, and there is no ambiguity about what is happening. <br /> <br /> Will Smith usually only likes when he is in full Bad Boys mode. The man is at his best when he plays the gun and drives the Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah" whenever he tries to act seriously only shows up as a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar that is obviously desperate for Ali. Perhaps this is the main reason why I do not look forward to the film, although it is worth less. There are flickers of comics but they are subtle, in fact Will Smith's most admired performance has ever been seen, and for this reason alone it was ironically ironic to be nominated for a grand prize. <br /> <br /> The support team was very impressive - Rosario Dawson looked pretty much at the door of death, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Piper were all right where all the other players were a little bit. <br /> <br /> In general, it's very crying - but not throwing all the usual clich√©s and emotional cumshot to give you no other choice but to cry. There were several times until my heart hardened almost broke. You will be under intense pressure not to find a situation that does not concern your life and makes it seem more realistic. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. The show "Will Smith" goes into drama without all the desperation "Pursuit of Happiness" comes better than that.
