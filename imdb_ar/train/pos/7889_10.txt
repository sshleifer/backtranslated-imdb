The Nightmare The Final Nightmare is as horrible and disturbing as every other nightmare on Elm Street, yes it has a comedy essence about it, as well as all the other movies, but how can anyone say you will not find Freddy Krueger scary, if you come across this The man in your dreams, you will not find him more terrifying with the essence of comic, because the comedy shows that he does not care about your death because he finds it very funny, and Freddy also play comic games with them, and in this way very disturbing, using his comic ways that I think they make movies The Nightmare Horror on Elm Street is what they are today. Unlike Jason Vorhis, who says nothing and has no idea of ​​really provoking his victims, this film is just as good as Freddy's wit and I would recommend it to anyone who has a comic sense of the way "Do not fall asleep!".
