Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who plays the Navin role stole the show. His facial expressions and comedic behavior make me upset my head because he was not in more comedy. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing that walks him but much, much more talent ... taking anything from Marty. The film really shocked me because of how close it was to the original shake, but again, it was much more. I really think that if this movie was released first, and I saw Steve Martin II, I think the second film was a cheap sale. I know this sounds like a bold statement, but it's true. I love Steve Martin a lot, but his performance is second in The Jerk Too. I hope I get a copy of it for my group. I urge you to see it if you can find it.
