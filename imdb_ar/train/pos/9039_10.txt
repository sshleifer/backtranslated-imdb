I grew up in South West Virginia. I am at the same age (or perhaps more than a year) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", the book that forms the basis of the true story of this thrilling film. <br /> <br /> So I am closely related to the subject of coal mining in West Virginia, and the stunning impact that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on us all. Rocket Boys went to make a wonderful life for themselves. I went to get my degree in physics and computer engineering. This is because Sputnik has awakened many young people to the "science gap" that the United States had experienced in the United States during the Cold War. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it would touch the very essence of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; See this; I recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
