I do not understand why other comments focus on Makonhee. The actor has never been an interesting film. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is writing and intelligence. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGowo make extraordinary comedy, certainly not stock. Although one can not say that their characters were well developed and do not make them less funny. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and had translations of the Spanish dialogue, so it was not a problem. Using Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> The film, which has been greatly underestimated, according to members of IMDb who got unusually low ratings, made this film. I think it was fun and interesting and worth at least 7. Lots of great-looking movies with high scores and making big money at the box office are less interesting.
