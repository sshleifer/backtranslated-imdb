First, consider that this film is about fifty years old! However, it still stands as one of the best films of all time. I wonder how many of the parachute productions of cellulose today will still be talked about in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, yet strong enough, and its effects are not too short for today. I remember the first time I saw this, when I was a child, when the beast entered the field of force to protect the ship and you had to see the outline for the first time (and only). If I trembled in fear, I can tell you. Looks dated today, but still more effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger are now showing their age. You can see the outline where the tiger has been placed in shots with Altaira, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect by which the creature melts its way through the doors of Krell is accomplished beautifully. It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for Airplane and Naked Gun movies) as a young man, but he's still mature. It was 30 when this movie came out! Nearly 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie is sure to continue to be a favorite for years to come. Egypt.
