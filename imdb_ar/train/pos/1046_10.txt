It is probably my favorite film ever, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication for a noble cause, but it is not conscious or boring. He does not grow old, although I have seen him about 15 times or more in the last 25 years. Paul Lucas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Davis House, in one of its few sympathetic roles, is fun. Children, as Grandma says, are more like "dwarfs dressed" than children, but that makes them more fun to watch. The slow mother's awakening to what is happening in the world and under its roof is reasonable and amazing. If I have thumb scores, they will all be "ready" for this movie.
