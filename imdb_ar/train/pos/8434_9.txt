I've always been a fan of the show, so I'll admit I'm biased. When the show ended, I felt that many questions remained unanswered. This film for me felt shut down. In the end, seeing all the people I have followed in the past few years is very rewarding. I have heard that this film is probably the only murder film we can expect. If so, this is the way to go. This film is sometimes moving, and sometimes annoying, but it is always satisfactory. If you are a fan of the show or have already watched it, watch this movie.
