I went to this I expect I do not like it; I thought it would be terribly worthwhile and serious, and instead, I tend to. I do not know much about Queen Victoria beyond what he knows so much - he is married to Albert, who died a young man, and was subsequently saddened. I saw the circumstances in which I grew up wonderful; in fact, I found myself wishing I had seen more of the story, and I imagine we might see a supplement at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning movie collections and unbelievably luxurious costumes without being too flashy. Representation is first class of all concerned. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was wonderful!
