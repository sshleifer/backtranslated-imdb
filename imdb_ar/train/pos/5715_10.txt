Karen goes to a Japanese home as an alternative nurse to Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen climbs upstairs after hearing voices when facing a scary ghost. You will learn the secrets of home. <br /> <br /> It's too scary! The scenes are horrible and scary! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole plot! The end was awesome! I paused at one of the sites where the little boy was hearing loudly for the man who found his sister upstairs and was shocked. This is the most terrifying film I have ever seen. I did not see the Japanese version I recommend this to horror lovers. 10/10 and 5 Stars!
