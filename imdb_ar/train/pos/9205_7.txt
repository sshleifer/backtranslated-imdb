This one grew on me. I love music. Burman Despite the more complex elements in the story, I found a lot of things that were affected by me and I still re-watched the film. My brother's sister line strong line, I thought. There are also things that may be more mandatory, such as band battles, a crime scene, etc. (Although this is not strange from a certain point of view). As the English translation is certainly by someone who was a little bit for him, I am grateful to him because he is grateful to him for that. Like many Bollywood movies that I have seen, this melodramatic film resembles the opera, including a song first sang by a little boy to encourage his abusive and unhappy sister, then the same song sung 12 or years later by The man who traveled to Kathmandu in an attempt to reconnect with this girl grew up and was troubled (she was told that her brother and mother had died), which frustrated her pain with drugs. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about 1971 is that it is about the Hippy movement, which brought hordes of researchers to India, from an Indian point of view, who see them as people driven to India because of the spiritual hunger raised by the failures of their societies, , In India, living only for the pleasures of time. The hippie scenes that sing with the dance are truly wonderful and precise in their tone (I am old enough to remember it), and I am quite certain that the masses of young children with special needs of white are real hippie additions, as I remember hearing about the children getting on the convoy to the east On this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> It is not about the actual movement of Herr Krishna, although the hippies in the film sing the Krishna / Rama song, as does a group of actual Indian worshipers, unrelated to the Hippies, in the opening scene of the film.) < br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
