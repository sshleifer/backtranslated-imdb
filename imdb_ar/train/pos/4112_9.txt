The title is an audio track, a tram on the bars. It is all imaginable that people living in a dump can not be. The misery of these people is illustrated by the tram which represents a rich life that is relatively unreachable from the middle class. The effects of the young boy and his beloved father so far are very moving. This was Kurosawa's first film in color and uses beautifully shocking colors and colors that are only seen in dreams. The film is surreal and excels in beauty. Sympathy for humanity is weak power, but as always, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a genius masterpiece of cinema.
