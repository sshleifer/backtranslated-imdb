This two-hour workshop is a powerful experience, with excellent work on setting up the characters and background of Enterprise, the prequel to the original Star Trek series. It is often found in the term "Trek" and the Cliche - it never seems that the sweet-colored space strikers have gone out of style, and I can actually sign Snickers to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the group looks strong, characters are well drawn, One can already see hints that this particular crew must be more stunt, in different ways, than those in the previous series (newer?). Scott Bakula bumps into the correct observation as a captain with Kirk's scream and his cowardice but without surprise and delight. I look forward to the ways in which the series will appear to the engineer, arms lord and communications officer (no longer just a glorious operator)! It seems that the writers chose the big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting a large band group and giving short characters, it starts with a smaller group of characters that can add more Diversity later - which I hope will happen, because after about half the episodes, more diversity will be needed.
