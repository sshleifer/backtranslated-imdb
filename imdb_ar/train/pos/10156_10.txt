This wonderful movie failed to score the highest rating of 5! why not! It is a wonderful depiction of Christ's life without the thrill of the Passion of the Christ.Johnny Cash did wonderful things for God that were surprisingly avoided and neglected in areas that should concern them more, like our churches. The film itself took less than a month to film, where Johnny felt a strong presence of God directing him. The great credit to all involved in this film is overwhelmingly overwhelming and will always be loved by its fans. At least the crusade of Billy Graham was rated high enough to be used as a major source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for their production. As the Walk the Line proved, it is strange that this man survived after alone produced such an amazing masterpiece. Movies are not printed by popular vote as this production proves! In short, I believe that this film is one of the great documentaries in the world because it is frank and candidly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!
