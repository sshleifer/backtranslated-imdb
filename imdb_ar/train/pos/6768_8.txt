One of my favorite programs in the 1980s. After the first season, the relegation began when they decided to add Jean-Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was interesting to see her and Ernst Borgnin's character went to each other. The last episode in which I appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long in television programs. Some episodes in the second season where well but in the third season was more about the human characters of Airwolf were only shown at the end of the show. When I went to USA, it was disgusting !!!
