Best view since Seinfeld. It's really really funny. Her self-centeredness, Stoner's gay neighbors, and her departure to the song or cartoons make this the most recent program on television. One of the few programs I have raised is the viewing point. The scene with a wise old black lady in a drugstore ("Wait now that you are soon and look old" turn your face with your finger and walk away from lol), overdose cough syrup, sleep with God, all very funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun. The weak points are her sister and her policeman just because she is very ordinary !! I can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt for any long time show.
