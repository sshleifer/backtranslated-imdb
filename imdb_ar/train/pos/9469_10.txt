There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing for sex that can end the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's law: anything that can make a mistake, will make a mistake. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Office) columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in counseling for everyday life, yet he realizes that things are not the perfect picture in his own country. Dan in Real Life is amazing in capturing these paradoxes in everyday life and is successful in embracing comedy, tragedy and beauty. In addition, this film is somewhat hilarious. <br /> <br /> His wife's death forces Dan to raise all three of his daughters on his own ... Every daughter in her pivotal stages of life: the first anxious to try to get out of her driving license, and the other middle in her teenage rage, Drifting away from early childhood. Things take the role of Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for family reunion and stumbles across an interesting woman in a bookshop. <br /> <br /> Her name is Mary (Juliet Pinochet, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid embarrassing situations ... which are stored specifically when put in the Burns family home. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Steve Carell in the office or Little Miss Sunshine, you know that it's not matched with comic timing and a very dynamic actor. Steve Carell is wonderful in capturing all the emotions that come with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family as well as the home itself provide a warm environment for the film that contrasts with the internal turmoil that has escalated throughout the film and finally bursts into an impressive climax. The film is short in some expected results, but at the same time life is made up of paradox and predictability: a paradox in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life certainly deserves his vision, to enjoy the only one to see all the minute details we often miss in everyday life, and I will probably enjoy it for the second time, or even the third. Just "put it in the tab".
