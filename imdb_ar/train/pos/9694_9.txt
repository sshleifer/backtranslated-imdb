I have captured this moving and delightful film, not to mention the surprise. I was also surprised when Jay's voice was found by Jay Mohr. The performance was very accurate, did not sway in schmaltz and did not become too difficult under the choices of New Jersey, so much so that I thought this should be an old-time supporter unknown, not Mr. The performance is very impressive and in fact, it is our pleasure to see his talents taken seriously in a series of independent independent films.
