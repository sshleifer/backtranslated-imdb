First of all, there is no good book like a book, especially when dealing with a writer like Tolkien. This adaptation beautifully combines Tolkien's world with the 1970s, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - sometimes the "animation" and the "background graphic" are somewhat "rough" in their artistic implementation, but they are beautiful at all, and very exciting in terms of giving a unique "place feeling" to each scene. Beyond absolute exclusivity in the images is the highly distinguished voice representation - the representation that FAR is superior to acting in the films of the new living movement. Although mobile animations may not be more "technologically efficient" animations, they capture beautifully the physical and facial gestures of acting while never forgetting to be subtle and subtle. The background paintings vary from the traditional "fantasy" to the explicit abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always driven by the novel and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person you have to have a computer projector in a movie so that everything is visible to you, then I can see how you might not like this movie, but if you enjoy superior photography, serial representation and JRR Tolkien, this movie is a must see.
