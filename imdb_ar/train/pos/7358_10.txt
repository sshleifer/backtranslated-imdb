One of the most provocative movies ever made with an excellent film show powered by Mc Clarens is a faint and startling quote: "Do you believe in love on the first site?" <br /> <br /> The expressive effect was evident in this image, more catapult safety films are flawless. Evby Longoria's Gabby (AKA Joey) was obviously fond of the film and the role she played so much that she could not be bothered to mention it in her film. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie must be without doubt, the heroic rescue by MC clure because it saved the little boy "disabled" with the speech impediment .. which I can add was acted to perfection! James Cahill's use of sound effects is unmatched to this day. The bust of drugs performed early in the film is a realistic pain. When I first saw this film, I was very forced to lack respect for Gang Endheid Brothers of the Southside Gang and CTM (Cut Mouth Larynx). This was by far one of the most coated cracks that Cahill committed to photograph. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has emotional value for me and I will download it in the near future. This if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
