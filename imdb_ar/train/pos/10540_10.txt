I can only agree with the taxi counter as a great movie and must be seen by a wide audience. Imagination on the screen, the visual interpretation of the text, humor is constantly surprise. The two leaders are wonderful and really carry the film. My advice is not to watch a trailer, but to rent the movie and watch it without expectation. I've hired a bomb, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but I think most people will have a view that's always good, unless it's just "stupid". I loved this movie, you do not see this jewel every day. This must become your favorite cult. Try it, you may feel the same way I feel.
