This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and liked it, but this film expands on everything the book is famous for. The acting is superb, especially from John Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very sinister character. This film has a certain storytelling style that makes you hooked all the time, until the end where everything is assembled together for a wonderful ending. I also love the way it is directed, through the twinkle back and forth between the modern era and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story is written by Louis Sacher, yes, but this story seems to have been made for the film, and Andrew Davis is doing a great job of directing it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.
