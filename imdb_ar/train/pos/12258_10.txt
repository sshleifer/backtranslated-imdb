Emma Jane Austen is a very interesting story in the worst of times, and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is irreparable. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good script and excellent cinematography) capable of producing comedy effectively, failed to make Emma popular. Paltrow is not backed by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for the part (I think of the times) and she looks positively sick in imperial dresses. On the other hand, Kate Beckinsell runs the comedy effortlessly and still manages to show what Mr. Knightley sees (more Jane Austen romantic heroes). Mark Strong is the wonderful Mr. Knightley with the right mix of handsome appearance, appropriate age, equestrian, compassion and respectable behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightley are supported by a group of good actors and production as a whole very delicious.
