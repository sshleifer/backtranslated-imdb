During the opening night of Vanties a dead woman was found on the podium above the stage. As the parade continues, the police are trying to assemble the killers from and why before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that this puzzle was a great classic comedy, so I was excited to find a copy of myself. Unfortunately, no one told me the musical numbers that go on and on. While the figures are certainly the kind that Hollywood did in its heyday, it has become intrusive because it largely stops the film despite attempts to weave films around them. This will not be so bad if the music is halfway, but not so. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew they had one song, cocktails for two, we had to take four versions: the duo, the big production number, like the vanity final and in the background as casual music. I do not think Spike Jones and Sellers have played them too much. The rest of the film is very good with Victor McLaglen sparring well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton seems very funny to watch as an actor in love with a wardrobe mistress. <br /> <br /> No way, I can recommend this if you think you can get musical numbers, or you're ready to scan. Through them. It's a fun movie of the kind they do not make anymore.
