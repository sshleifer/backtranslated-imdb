It's been a long time since I've seen this mini-series and I'm happy to say that the advantages I remembered stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> I think most of the components of the "perfect spy," that is, the most beautiful adaptation of LeCarré novels, are at my highest. The salient aspects of this are the musical result and the skillful scenario, and the last one was written by Arthur Hopkraft, who was also, I think, a scriptwriter "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" with Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are very good, some of them great, such as Alan Howard, Jack Brotherhood, and Rick McNally of Ricky Bem. Peter Egan is wonderful to watch because his face changes with every corner of the camera. Time and influences on the physical manifestations of characters are very reasonable. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only shock comes after Magnus Pem's personality is transferred from the very capable hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to the remarkably old followers of Peter Egan, a new man outside Oxford. But this is simple and unimportant in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty persuading only when the text becomes melodramatic and needs emotional "annoyance," that is, crying. None of the actors have a very interesting time at this moment, apart from the wonderful Francis Tomletti, who plays Peggy Wentworth with all she deserves and steals the ring with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is as annoying as Mary Pym. She has a part of the character under her skin, but she is often exposed to the fragility she is reduced to as a tough diplomatic housewife, Marie Pem. Rudiger and Wijang are wonderful like Excel, entertaining, jovial and wonderful. I also enjoyed the Sarah Baddle camp as Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans has been clearly shown in some fun scenes. When Yank came out to communicate with Bo Drums (head MI6), the American battalion is portrayed as a beheaded batons who seem to have memorized many long words from the dictionary and spice it freely with American terminology and psychological phrase. , A lot of disdainful annoyance of English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness blend skillfully. LeCarré has a talent for mixing the disparate elements of his stories. Hopcraft has masterfully captured the gloomy atmosphere, but the original sadness. <br /> <br /> It is not the perfect production (what is it?) and yet the best in LeCarre adaptations to reach movies or TV yet. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all spying lovers and especially LeCarré lovers. DVD available from Walnut.
