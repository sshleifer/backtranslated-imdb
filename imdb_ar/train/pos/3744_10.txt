Maybe this is the best short crime drama I have ever seen. The acting is wonderful, especially Amanda Burton, who transforms her personality from scary to sweet and sad to sad and then ... she does an amazing job balancing Rachel / Karlas's feelings and representing the pain of someone who has lost a child, which is very reasonable and looks like a real life story and drama. Other actors are of course also wonderful, which is usually in British television / film. The end, which I will not give up, is great mainly because you do not really get one ... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) again and again and if you do not touch this you're a cool hearted person.
