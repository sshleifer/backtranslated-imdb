For a long time did not see a very beautiful cartoon feature. With full respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other IM film can not be compared to this. The animation created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the ocean background is full of mind, almost everything is framed in every frame. I sometimes felt ache in my spine - I loved it often. <br /> <br /> The plot is very romantic. A romantic plot like an animated film could possibly be. Pet Characters, Private Hector, Blue Rabbit, Owned, Pawns, Rocks and Rules! The other char is also very nice. First-class humor. <br /> <br /> In general, it seems that creators have not invested much effort in this. I mean it did not seem to take much difference from people at Pixar & Dreamworks who are trying hard each time to think of something new. I am very pleased that the European animation studio product has become very impressive. They made a wonderful and touching film, a candy for the eye and the heart. <br /> <br /> The only minus is a dumb start and that's why it's 9 out of 10 and not 10/10
