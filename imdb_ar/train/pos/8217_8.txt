Since this is the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood does not only compose with stars, but also produces and goes out, you know it should be good. Although some say Enforcer is the best in the series, I disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy to be in this series. Although The Enforcer is a good film with two good episodes, it does not get the dirty and brave effect of the other three films. This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood good, and has got quotes that make Dirty Harry good. In Diry Harry it's "Well, punk?" In Magnum's power, "a man must know his limits"; in this "go ahead. In this film too, it is good to see a scene change, where it is a little tired of watching the streets of San Francisco itself in other movies in the series. Through the wonderful representation of Clint Eastwood and starring Sandra Locke, and good guidance by Clint, this is in my opinion the best Harry Dirty sequel ever.
