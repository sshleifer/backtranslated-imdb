We do not have to lose this film, it's one of the greatest I have ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of the most memorable films of nouvelle. Jean Ostach is no longer on this earth, we have only black and white photos to remember one of France's greatest and most valuable managers. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget that. <br /> <br /> P.S .: Sorry for English ...
