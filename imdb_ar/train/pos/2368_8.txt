The plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a former bitter cop spread in the "peacemakers" after the murder of his friend by their leader. While there, he discovers that women want to run for mayor and will do anything to achieve this goal, even murder. The cast is good (Geoff Wincott is a good military artist and a good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays an exciting role Opposing opponent to another bad guy Matthias Hughes also plays a good martial artist. A good direction (fighting scenes too). The rest is fine, with Tony Burton playing Kurt's friend who was killed by Nielsen, while Cindy Bass plays the role of a bad girl from producers of another martial arts film / Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas. Best of the Martial Law series.
