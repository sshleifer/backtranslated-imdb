This is not as fierce as I expected, making the violent scenes seem more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists, turns, back stabbing and double-intersection all the way the movie makes it hard to tell who is standing next to a particular character. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast with some good dialogue and personal development and gives an interesting insight into the business of the Triad ring that you follow. <br /> <br /> Violence When it comes to brutality, there are no weapons or scenes of martial arts with special effects, this is believable in the violence of your face, and for any dialogue you are never allowed to forget, Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The ending is sudden but perfectly consistent and believable.
