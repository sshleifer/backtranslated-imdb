In 2054 in Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controls the city, and when a young woman is kidnapped, director Carras (Craig) must run against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance is a wonderful mix of films blending with a conceptual futuristic novel that illuminates the screen in a shocking palace with a Nuer ideology and conceptual montage that will delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixar are the masters of animation. Their many Oscar-winning films do not end up from the story of the charming game to the mysterious wall, so any company or director faces a real challenge in beating them. The Renaissance is not a film aimed at the young audience, and like Persepolis 2007, brings a strong and mature approach to this type of animation to produce an older and more challenging film for its larger target generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released the wonderful and shockingly Noir Sin City film that shook the full use of the green screen with a remarkable balance in black and white photography with strange mutations in color. A year later, Christian Volkman took a similar approach to this stroke As skillful as filmmaking. <br /> <br /> However, the Volkman image is full of animation but does not look half-realistic for most of its powerful hour-and-40-minute time. The characters' faces are well photographed, and in particular, this film should be the best ever to use the shadow. The fact that we never know whether its night or day is irrelevant when we simply look at the rock faces while the shadows mix in their expressions. It is a clever use of pathetic error, and it is also precisely directed. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has watched Persepolis, it will come to an end. It is one of the best animated animations ever presented for simple testing. But the very conceptual technique of art by Marjan Satrapi <br /> <br /> The Renaissance corresponds to that image and in many cases competes with stronger images and a darker tone to reflect the mood. One scene in particular when Karas appears from the dark, is beautifully photographed. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a stubborn and strange political government that keeps every citizen. The Paris race returns to the mysterious Avalon, which we do not see enough to get the essence of its true dominance. The Renaissance reigns in the narratives about the attempts of a tired cop to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see the policeman Craig the tired and the tedious trying to rescue while fighting with the other elements. There are many wrong things in scripting, not to mention that the tired tired cop routine is now out of date, but there are lots of irritable adrenaline and jerking between the characters to keep it alive until it goes in two ghastly final stages.
