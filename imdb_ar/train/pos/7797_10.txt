Ruby in Paradise is a beautiful story coming from a young woman named Robbie Lee Giesing, fleeing from her stifling roots to become herself. Although the character of the title played brilliantly by the brilliant Ashley Judd - probably her first film role, although she is quite proud - the focus is not on becoming "someone" Madonna coming (be it the mother of Jesus or the angry singer who attracts attention ). <br /> <br /> He instead focuses on following one's instincts and meditating on them to some extent, to grow into the ideal person for adults. Note: This is not a motion picture! She uses an occasional voice narration (by Ms. Good) while writing in her journal - Oh, I've just lost half of the male readers there. But be patient with this beautiful film, as we learned that one's grace can be discovered - Oh, I do not carry water or cut wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / writer Todd Field, who played the role of Nick Sharing Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut" in the role of Ruby Lee in love with noble love, helped her to heal her idea of ​​cultivated relationships of young people. <br /> <br /> But even his character is not the solution to Robbie Lee: no external hero imposed upon her. The final message is that we are responsible for ourselves. The writer / director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold," performed an amazing work showing a young woman growing up in herself - facing old challenges of good against evil along the way. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are also excellent, and the music used, especially the anthology by Shantos Sam Phillips (whom I hear is T. Bone Burnett's wife), works directly - especially "trying to hold onto the ground." "Now, when I hear the first few chords of that song, tears are beginning to explode in my eyes, Pavlovian and not banned - I'm not sure whether the music, or the indelible contact with the quiet and enchanting message of empowerment of the film. For any woman who tries to find his way, for any woman of any age, we should see the downside: not on DVD, except in Spanish. (However, we learned that it is legal to create a single version of the VHS, which can be easily found online My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got a copy of a DVD I made for me.) The film sometimes pops up on the air You can not count on it when you need it most as an energizer to calm the world's pressure, so buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a major release, Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
