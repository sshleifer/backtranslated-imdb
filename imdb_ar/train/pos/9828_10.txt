I will be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a great zombie flicker full of movement, original ideas and good behavior, but it's also full of bad zombie influences. Part IV, entitled "After death" is also good. I recommend this movie to horror lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should check out the Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, the Slumber Party Massacre away from Camp, and other full moon images.
