As an amateur historian in World War II / Nazi Germany, I could not wait until it appeared on a DVD. I missed it when it was the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about historical errors. It is better to do a better job of portraying Hitler as a "magician". I also faced a small problem in some choice options, not because of their representation, but because of their appearance. Peter Stormare is not much like Rom, why did not they make Bapson as Hess wearing a wig? The biggest complaint ... was always made of the amazing blue eyes of Hitler, why did not they make Carlisle wear blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked terrific. Again, as long as the people who watch this realize that this is supposed to be the first entertainment, the second date does not think too much harm will happen.
