The US Department of State does not want us to see this film, because they have beef with the Iranian government. However, it does show us how truly Iran's culture is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest terms: the ability to watch a soccer game on the pitch, which is strictly restricted to male audiences alone. The film is very funny, and in itself is evidence of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie very much. Five girls are trying to break through the police border at the ticket gates for a match between Iran and Bahrain. The comedy that followed is so funny to describe, from bus journey to stadium, to police intervention and subsequent detention of girls, and even to the resulting end. Do not miss this classic movie. Must see. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.
