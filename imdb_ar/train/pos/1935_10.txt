Writing something real and true is a challenge. Find out how to shoot it and assemble it without making it trivial better. Ishai Setton is one of the films in which you can learn about life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was impressed by the "big bad swim" and from now on I will promote it as much as possible. It's a shame that I can not get something to show it to my friends (you know, like DVD ???), because talking is good ... but giving something to be seen better. No one can go to festivals to discover such a pearl and this film is really worth putting it there! Many thanks to the staff of this master piece, I am waiting for their distribution.
