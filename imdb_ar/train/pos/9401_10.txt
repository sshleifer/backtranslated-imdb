What a wonderful movie, qualified for many posters that do not get: Sci-fi, Noir film, with high IQ script and dialogue that supposedly has a cultured audience, cultured ..... The type of English film that was only implemented a year ago 1960 England (which appears only in cinemas in the United States of America when it first arrived), and never happened in the United States of America. <br /> <br /> The main characters in The Man In The White Suit (1951), Sir, Alec Guinness and Jane Greenwood routinely use multi-science reference words, such as polymers, and discuss and explain chemistry concepts such as "long chain molecules" Then they convey the importance of this to the ordinary human being, and the benefits that science offers him. <br /> <br /> The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the bursting video games that now dominate (2009) the global cinema and certainly dominate the great American cinema ......., he cleverly narrated a story he gave The representatives of the talented and educated English language (whom the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are learners, accomplished people) are all done through comedy, magic, pity and a sense of irony that the ancient Greek drama agreed upon. <br /> <br /> Everyone has to see this film and someday, somehow, some good directors and supporters have to make another example. <br /> <br /> It's great.
