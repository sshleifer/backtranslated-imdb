Now that's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror stroll uses its borders to its advantage. WENDIGO, despite its shortcomings at times, is a triumph of imagination. Granted, it relies heavily on the EVIL DEAD camera, which is moving for its mood, but is still a better 99% live streaming video. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple: the family takes a holiday in a remote cabin and is threatened by a particularly unregulated fisherman. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of creepy spam through the use of legendary Wendigo. is this real? Is everything in the boy's imagination? Is it external to the emotional state of the child? <br /> <br /> Some have laughed that the film is unsatisfactory because it leaves you with the decision. Do not be late for such a little nonsense. The film that makes you think it is not a movie to avoid. It's one to rejoice in.
