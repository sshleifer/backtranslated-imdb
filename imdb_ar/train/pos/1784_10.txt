The evening is an entertaining movie with some depth. All actors and actresses turn in stunning performance. With a huge cast, though, one expects star representation, but in this film the expectations were exceeded. One can relate to personalities and attitudes in that particular family. When you observe the interaction of family members, remember the memories of your family immediately. This is one of the few films that inspire anyone to read the book. Usually the opposite. One reads the book then wants to see the film. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. Rhode Island scenery is as spectacular as the soundtrack. No orange car will enjoy the cars seem to recapture the period with experience. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend the evening. See that you will enjoy it.
