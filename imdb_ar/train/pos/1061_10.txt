All the actions performed in the first season were really fantastic. The first look you get from Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as I like to call them small dresses. The duo performs the best job I have ever seen. Key actors and actors, such as Jessica Alba, Michael Weatherley, etc. They make you forget that you are watching a fictional television show. Turns out they seem to make this show come alive. All in all this is the best show I have ever seen
