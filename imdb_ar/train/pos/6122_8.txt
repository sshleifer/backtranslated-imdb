This movie is very hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer somehow transformed into a snowman by a chemical accident. Then head to the city and start to terrorize the locals. It is up to the local police chief and some other characters to try to prevent him. It's made with a limited budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film is that it knows that trash. The styrofoam and polystyrene imitations of the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - it is one of the few films with a budget as a major selling point. Along with the comic brilliance, there are some other wonderful comedy moments - first heard it to hear the sound of my father scaring his children to death, and a gangster scene tied to the cinema. Great tacky fun
