Well, it's again a movie that plays with your emotions and goes out completely against a rock movie. But I sucked for those so I gave him a good degree ... The acting was very good and there was a great feeling the violence is kept to a minimum which makes the change. I had given him 9 if he did not greet in the end! All in all a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
