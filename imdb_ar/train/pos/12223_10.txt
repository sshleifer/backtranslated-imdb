I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-1990s and I've seen it many times since. It's a big mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school student in a California town whose younger sister's sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer. She meets Mary Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police student who sees her happiness and decided to work together to try and find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this person. The real crime feels like "real" or real to me. I read a review of the newsgroup, where someone wrote that the full suspension of kufr is here and this is true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nann do a great job, as do other actors. She is right, and the writer / director, Pat Verducci, really embodies some of the facts of teenage life and Mary's unity (see the scene in which Mary awakens the sequence of dreams after seeing the pictures she took of Tony). I hope that Verducci will produce more films. <br /> <br /> I did not see any other movie just like True Crime. 10/10
