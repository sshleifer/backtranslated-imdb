"Castle of Blood" (also known as "Castle of Terror") is an amazing and surprising entrance from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Great black-and-white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, somewhat logical textual writing, deliberate and surprising speed (though quite appropriate) that distinguish this image from one another. Only sometimes the hockey movies of music and "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steel) and Alan (George Riviere) watch a surprising entertainment film. <br /> <br /> Sitting in a bar, he tells one of his ghost stories of Count Blackwood. In recognition of the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, asked to interview Bo. During the conversation, Bo reveals that all his stories are true. Incredibly, Alan expresses his doubts about life after death. Count Blackwood shows Alan betting on 100 pounds because he can not survive tonight at Blackwood Castle, the night after Halloween when walking. Alan can not afford to bet, so he bet on a Â£ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mario Bava's "Black Sunday", known as the Devil's Mask, "The Castle of Blood" is somewhat constrained, making the few moments of violence more frightening, especially surprising from a director usually associated with films Terrible Italian space from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the only version of this movie has found a badly deteriorated (and recorded) version and pan scan. Nevertheless, she is worth watching, and calls for a reissue, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Lov Hewitt as Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares well with The Haunting film by Robert Wise.
