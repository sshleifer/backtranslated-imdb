I got this one a few weeks ago and loved it! It is modern and light but filled with the real complexities of life. They are questions and answers, just like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. These images are much more, globally, than the bubbles we may live in. You do not need to be Jewish or gay to enjoy this - I'm not, but the movie goes straight to the top ten movies. At first, entertainment looks pure but makes you think more. The relationships we must live with are superficial, meaningful, deep and deadly. You do not know what will happen, and certainly do not know where this story is heading and when you see it the first time. It is worth watching several times. Fox films include great additional material - here is a great music video and "industry" (including an explanation of the title, an interview with Lior Ashkenazi, who plays in the film and Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyles)
