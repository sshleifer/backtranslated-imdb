It seems as though it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but it is actually a very focused story of the relations between three teenage girls in a synchronous French pool team. There are no parents or teachers talking about them, no school, and the children are represented by a single peripheral character, a huge Francois who enters the story you select from time to time and always leaves a bewilderment. <br /> <br /> The youngest of the three, only aspires to join the team I liked so much. It's kind of weird looking. She has not yet graduated from her adolescent growth spurt and has long bone limbs and big feet and does not talk about it. It's the forerunner and sport of these plump lips sought. After a while the appearance of it grows on you and from certain angles can come to show you a break. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, well, more physically developed. She has a bright personality cut in her swimming suit, wandering around, harassing the boys, and sweeping her long blonde hair. But it is not as it seems. Or is she? I could not quite figure it out. French is long in contradictions and short in consistency. No wonder Francois always inhales her. <br /> <br /> There is not much mystery in the character of Louse Blachere. She is also in the team but tired, frank and sensitive to her, and has a crushing crush on Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to personal indifference through her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three, which means conspiracies, deception, hidden feelings and all we link with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is of course a difficult subject. Becomes more complex during the progressive evolution of a homogeneous relationship between Pauline and Adele. You should not expect this to be a soft-spoken film. The only nudity we see is much less than it runs, and the little sex that is under the covers, literally at times. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to get involved in the plot or analyze it too much, in part because it is suggestive rather than expressed through work, partly because it is complicated, and the other reason is that I am not sure I have everything. <br /> <br /> Let me give an example. Okay. Adele is the other girl's envy. She is also very distant and satisfied with herself. Moreover, she seems to miss every boy and man on the horizon if they can ever make use of it, from the handsome but stupid Francois to the bus driver you want. She brags proudly about her English experience. When Pauline approaches them to join the swimming team, Adele uses her as a comrade during tasks with the players. Narcissistic superior and tolerant, you know? But then she takes a slender soybean poulin down her wing and reveals to Pauline that she is still a virgin. really? Yes really. Pauline begins to approach Adele and finally admits Adele that she wants to get rid of her hymen and wants Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, who is now sexually attracted to Adele, performs the task with a quiet enjoyment. Now Adele really want to get it with a man, preferably older and experienced. So Pauline moves to a dance where she dances seductively with someone until she follows Pauline to the powder room. The two girls stand there staring at each other and do not openly express an obsessive interest in the other. But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly lays her own reins, reaches, and accepts Adele on the lips. "There is now, it was not so bad, is it?" Adele retreated, smiling. , Then return to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a very accurate description of what is going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? At first, Adele deals with Pauline as an irrelevant child, later as a close friend, and finally as a potential lover - and the moment Pauline responds, Adele begins with satisfaction. Do you use paulin in the way it seems to be used by men? Does Adele please know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Louise Blachiri, the third member of the Trilogy of Flowers, a regular and full-blown sunflower, whose expression always suggests weakness, but who is at least the opposite sex and the first three to rid herself of that loud virginity, Skip it to space considerations. <br /> <br /> Do you see that? In all ways. (Just compare it with the typical American film about high school kids). For men, some of whom have never penetrated the charm of girls, this may give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in a medium shot.
