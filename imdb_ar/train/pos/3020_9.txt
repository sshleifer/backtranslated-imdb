I feel a bit of protection for this film because it was an introduction to me at the United Nations. It was 1972, and I.T.V. All eight features ran in a single bumper tour (followed by the replay of the "masked" starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday evening. "Karate killers" were selected for the opening season. It began with an impressive sequence when the Solo and Kuryakin sports cars were attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-helicopters. I was a fan of life from that moment onwards. <br /> <br /> After the main appropriations (it is good to see a sequence of the title here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action shots) we go to the laboratory of Dr. Simon True (Jim Pauls), inventor of a new formula for extracting gold from seawater. The wife of Tru Amanda (Joan Crawford) had an affair with Thrash Randolph's agent Herbert Lom. Fellow ruthless in fact, he kills both the doctor and his wife, before searching for the formula. True prepared for the event - he divided it into five sections, each written on a picture of himself, and sent to his five daughters, all of them scattered all over the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin began to get the formula first, resulting in a series of episodes in different locations, and episodes such as Tally Savalas, Terry-Thomas, and Curt Jurgens. One of the daughters of Dr. Tru-Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanied by U.N.C.L.E. Boys in their global quest. <br /> <br /> After assembling the formula, THRUSH appears and makes them deliver them, before being transported to their secret base in the Arctic ... <br /> <br /> Of all the UNCLE feature films, this is the movie that I feel it should have Specially produced for cinema. It hurts me to be a television producer, though more expensive than usual. No filming of sites has occurred, and various sectors have become frequent, usually peaking in scrap between the United Nations. And castles. Among the actors, Joan Crawford was distorted in her small role, and Kurt Jurgens misrepresents that he is a door to sugar. As a child in London, Terry Thomas is as delightful as ever, and Herbert Lum is as good as the main villain. Kim Darby grate though "Sandy". She should have been told to stay at home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that he is able to be more entertaining and entertaining than many of the official film releases of the time, including "In Like Flint", Casino Royale and "Ambushes". I would like to know how Solo and Associates escaped from Thrush HQ. After the death of Randolph though.
