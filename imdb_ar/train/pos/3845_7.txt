Anomalous, slow, entertaining erotic stunts with many graphic scenes and "blasphemy" that will undoubtedly upset some viewers. However, it will be difficult for them not even to appreciate the many sequences contained in this film, or to ignore the performance of the first class Krabbe. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing paradox throughout the film, playing in the sense of a hero's vision of hatred. Unfortunately, every 5 minutes everything turns into blur, and the unsatisfactory result is certainly not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
