In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted brilliant adventure, Bill and Ted are exposed to the threat of the future, where evil Chuck de Nomulus sends evil robots, masquerading as Bill and Ted to the ground to kill Bill and Ted, the future. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves outperform the crowd in this fun series. Despite its lack of first intensity, Bogus Journey still contains wonderful phrases and dialogue from the leading couple, not to mention the hilarious performance of William Sadler, who combines a sense of humor in depth, the gloomy gloomy machine. Watch the sequence of games, the best moment in the entire film, but one of the many wonderful techniques used to justify this genre. <br /> <br /> Although he is still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film about him, with stakes more dangerous and more dangerous. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another favorite feature. Creators also extend to the boundaries of this fantasy type and use realism, where hell and heaven are very symbolic and are in the conspiracy. This type of fantasy is again discovered by using this amazing travel machine, although again somewhat confusing in the dots with the use of timing, objects and positions that are placed before they occur at the moment, as is evident in the last couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first hour she hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy because I appreciate the jokes and the story more, and although the jokes and the plot is not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey enjoys enough motives, jokes and conspiracy Fairly stable to make it a wonderful family movie.
