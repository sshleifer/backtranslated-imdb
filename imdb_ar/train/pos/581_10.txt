A River Runs Through It is one of the films that deserves to be seen in the theater so that its cinematic appreciation can truly be appreciated. Representation is wonderful and understated, with every gesture, smile and gesture meaning. Brad Pitt offers a wonderful performance and Tom Skerrit is as strong as the preacher's father. The film moves like a river, it must be prepared to follow it through sharp flows, but it is worth it in the end.
