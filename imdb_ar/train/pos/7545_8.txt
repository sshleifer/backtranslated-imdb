I really liked it though, while reading the reviews, it was very disturbing for me ... but I'm impressed with anime for anime, I can fully understand this ideal artwork although some of it was against my cultures and beliefs ... but hey, it's the world of art. . !! The beginning of the film is very strong and strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the person who made it. Only a very open person can make such a bold film .. It is not children at all .. Although the characters are nice and wonderful but pass some of the unpleasant adventures that can not be erased (sorry if the spelling error) of those memory ..
