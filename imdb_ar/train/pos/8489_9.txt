I teach Japanese to a high school online and ensure cultural activities so that students can learn about the country as well as the language. Watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can either buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, and this helps students to see that others look at the world and their lives differently from what we see. Many of my students told me they enjoyed the film a lot and would get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we appreciate in this culture and what we value in their culture. I hope I can get a TV version that has been cleaned up. I'm not really in the raw language used by motorists all the time.
