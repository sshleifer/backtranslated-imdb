Although this film put Davis on the map because of her brilliantly intense performance as an illiterate harasser / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfactory to me as a whole. The behavior is fine in most respects. What I can not understand for my life is how or why Philip, the sensitive young man who constantly deals with the continuing abuse of this homelessness: I find his naive tolerance unbelievably unbelievable in some respects. Yes, I know he is cultured sensitive and sensitive introvert. But Davis is a witch so toxic that none of the intellectuals will tolerate her position or her actions and make her believe. Davis is amazing in her role: Yes, her history may go down from time to time, but she is clearly imaginative in any way you look at her. Too bad they were not playing lousy gangs. Her personality was completely believable as a vagabond among low spirits!
