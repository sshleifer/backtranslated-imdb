It may be hard to believe, but this film has been condemned as immoral from the platforms more than any other film produced before the Hayes Blue Code was imposed. Yes indeed, the priests told their flocks that anyone who went to see this movie was committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I do not. They had several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Element: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan appear as they wake up one morning in their shelter at the top of the tree. "Tarzan, I was a bad boy!" She says with an angry look. So they did not just have sex, they had sex! A few years later, under the Hayes Act, people (especially women) were not supposed to portray themselves as enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Element: Jin prefers a guilty, yet wise, savage, brutal (Tarzan) to a respectable civilized man of nine to five (Holt). When Holt initially fascinated her with beautiful clothes from London, she loomed a bit; when Holt tried to kill Tarzan, and both Holt and Jane thought he was dead, she twisted a lot. But when she realizes that her husband is alive, the features of civilization fade away. why not? Tarzan and Jane's relationship is equality: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that will force him to assert himself as "the head of his wife." To take off, it lacks many "civilized" rest situations, eg jealousy. When Holt arrives and his friend, Tarzan welcomes them clearly, and they know perfectly well that Holt is the torch of the ancient Jin. When Holt puts on her clothes in London and dances with her with a portable sound card, Tarzan comes down from a tree and paints his knife. jealous? Both. It's just a caution against the exotic music machine, because it's never seen before. Once explained, be great. <br /> <br /> Element: Holt civilization is dirty. Tarzan's brutality is sexy and innocent. As Jane slides into the bright tent of Holt, Holt begins to watch her silhouette turn into the wonderful dress. On the contrary, after Tarzan pulled the dress, kicked it into the swimming hole and snorkeled it, followed the most exciting scene in all cinema: the husband spends five minutes in a beautiful water ballet. The scene was filmed in three versions - naked and naked - the scene was cut before the film was released, but the bare version was restored in the video available now.) When Jane appears, the leopard stole the dress for her sake and to the eye, Jane shows that her anger is only due to Proximity to "civilized" men and their suspension from work. Where is the "universal wisdom" dear to the hearts of academics? Anywhere, this is the place. Another reason why I looked at this movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> Element: The idea that man is the crown of creation, and that animals are here only for man's use and comfort, takes a heavy blow. Holt and his friend want to be guided by the Elephant Cemetery so that they can collect ivory and bring it back home. They want Tarzan to guide them to a cemetery. You, dear reader, are thinking of "Fat chance!" And you're right I was shocked. He exclaims "Elephants sleep!" Who explains everything to him. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which the gentlemen find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Element: Jane, the former civilized woman, is far more tricky than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and his friend blow them up, and find themselves trapped by hostile tribes and wild animals. It's a gene that keeps it cool. During the boy's panic, she takes command and orders and produces guns. <br /> <br /> Element: Jin's costume is a kind of coat and there is nothing underneath it. (The original idea for her was to be naked, as the foliage technically blocks her nipples, and that is indeed the case in one short scene.) Finally, many men complained about the cloth because the film was called "Tarzan And his "instead of" Tarzan and his wife. " No comment! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who was nurtured by his monkey friends, returned to his health, rescued them and hunted white fishermen and urged them to carry the elephants and the African campaign to return ivory. They were robbed to the holy place where he came from. End. <br /> <br /> So there. Totally subversive film. Like all other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, the acquisition of Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which formed this flowing species in the early 1930s and which ended this abrupt end by adopting the Hayes Act. <br /> <br /> The best way to express this movie is a soprano version of the famous Jane Tarzan. Nice touch, which unfortunately has been abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminism, sex.
