*** SPOILERS *** In the first World War II films that came out of Hollywood that show how the war affected these soldiers, or in this case the US Marines, who fought in it. <br /> <br /> Al 21-year-old Schmid, John Garfield, had just begun to get a job for a good paycheck about $ 40 a week at the local steel mill and girl Ruth Hartley, Eleanor Parker, who was about to The marriage when Japs spoiled everything for him, and millions of similarly young Americans, by attacking the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. In the course of his duty as an American citizen, Al immediately joined the US Marine Corps in the hope of returning to Japs with the knowledge, as was later true, that the Marines would be the first US combat units to get a crack on them. <br /> <br /> Al finally got his chance when his unit, 1st Marine Division, landed on 7 August 1942 in Guadalcanal in the remote Solomon Islands to involve the Japanese they controlled. During the Battle of the Eilu River, Wahid alone stopped a large Japanese Bansai attack with his machine guns, a wave after a wave of Japs suicide attacks until assistance or reinforcements finally arrived. During the bloody fighting, Al had struck a Japanese bomb with a blot. <br /> <br /> He has now returned to recuperating states in a sea hospital that faces everything much more difficult to overcome and then fights a battalion-size attack of Japanese or German soldiers. Faces a future he will never see again and he must rely on others for his care or for him! <br /> <br /> We get to the film "Pride of the Marines" Al himself much harder then the Japanese troops in Guadalcanal to reach an agreement with his inability. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him, in fact, is the person who feels sorry for himself more than anyone else in the film. Thanks to the help of Marine Nurse Virginia Buffer, Rosemary Dickamp and Ruth with his US Marine colleague Lee Diamond, Dane Clarke gives all the courage in the face of blindness with the same strength he faced after a wave of Japanese troops on Gudalcanal. The courage of a god believed to have been lost in that hell left by God in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of US Navy Sergeant Albert Schmid, "Pride of Marine" showed what we expected from the tens of thousands of wounded American soldiers who returned from the war. Note how it was very difficult for those in war to adapt to peacetime in America when they left something, as in the case of Schmidt, on the battlefield. The battle of Al with his personal demons was much harder, then the Japanese who fought to be part of him, and thus had to fight himself to overcome them and defeat them in the end. Despite the help of both the Virginia nurse and his girlfriend Ruth as well as his doctor in the Navy - who has a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Beck - it is still up to Al to overcome the fears he has faced. The fears he and the only one in the battle face, as everyone in the film told him, all this himself.
