Anyone with a small boy at home should not watch black and white movies put on their TV. When the child walks, he wonders about all the shouting and shooting on the screen, telling him that this is a picture of adults and that it is not big enough to see it yet. Which will hold him there for a few minutes. Director George Stevens and his team will keep the end. <br /> <br /> I think my dad did it to me, anyway, and I prefer a man to it. This classic adventure yarn, located in India during the British occupation, is characterized by three army sergeants who find that their narrow union faces a solution when one prepares to marry a lover. The help comes in the form of the evil Thuji rebellion, in which soldiers find themselves united. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din was one of the best films to emerge from Hollywood's finest year, 1939. And even more than most of the great films of that golden year, it's amusing in a very immediate and accessible way. The subject of music is the moment of tenderness. While filming in California, the camera (the only thing in the movie "Gunga Din", which received Oscar nomination a lot) works with windy pride, much like Raj one hundred years ago. The scenes of the battle are portrayed in a very realistic fashion, not very violent but very chaotic as people fall and shoot at every corner of each frame in a realistic way, not like some Cecil B. slaughter festival. Holy Demiel. <br /> <br /> The script not only sets up motion scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three levels with fantastic puppets of humor. The main focus is on the sergeant. Cutter, chasing after long tales of golden treasures. He is a rare actor for Gary Grant, and his suitability is perfect for a film that never takes itself seriously when the thrill develops. <br /> <br /> A triple install is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who hangs on Philly Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his rabbit schemes. It's funny as it is in its own way, leaving the sergeant. Balantain (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., displays some nice Errol Flynnish impulses) as a person who has the love and ground interest enough to know that he needs to confuse his younger colleagues and grow up. <br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" was a life-long film, it will be about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her husband from his lost girlfriends and to dislodge the skull. But since it is a young film, the focus here is how the trio must stay together and save Balantain from a fate worse than death, not just marriage, but as Keter screams several times, and the tea company too. <br /> <br /> The Political Health Police is difficult for this film, not only for the gender issue but for the idea of ​​British soldiers who save poor Indians from vicious thugs. It is a huts of colonial apology. Fortunately, this film was reproduced when, therefore, producers did not feel the need to clarify the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, which must save on these three trunks, full of much false racial hatred and pride, along with the rest of their modest Bahisti army that only one Of the three were at any time when their consent was requested. After all, despite their arrogant glory, the real sacrifice of the film includes the title character, played by Sam Jaffe with great sadness. <br /> <br /> When this movie came back, Jack Warner had an old saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. However, it seems that the letters were flying fast and furious at "Gunga Din". I'm watching the film now and I wonder if it was the audience's goal at that time to wonder why Gonga Deen actually was when he led Cutter to the Golden Temple. Was he really planning to retaliate against his British predecessors? Was it justified in doing so, especially given his cold Mac Chizney treatment? When Colonel Wade delivered this tribute, Rudyard Kipling's poem, loosely based on the film, was a nod to the folly of imperialism and its formulation of someone who proved to be a "better man than me" in the end. What they made in the great teacher's speech, delivered in the very broken English language: "You swore as soldiers to die for faith, your country, England Well, I could die for my country and faith as easily as you ... India, Goodbye. "<br /> <br /> Of course, the same personality also guides his beastly followers:" Kill for the love of murder! Kill for the love of Cali! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! " Which means that it allows us to hate and root for the British, keeping questions about the meaning of all this later on. <br /> <br /> What it means to "Gunga Din" for me and most of all, is the fastest, safest 90 minute ride thrill on the video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there is one for us all watching "Gunga Din".
