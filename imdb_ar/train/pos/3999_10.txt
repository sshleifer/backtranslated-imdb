I am embarrassed to say that I missed the "mother" when she was in the theaters. I saw him this evening on a DVD. I gave it 10 votes, which is one of the few I gave here. This independent English was filmed very carefully and high quality. She attracted me relentlessly. The story, a little base and purely human, is brutally honest and fully absorbed, thanks to the representation of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Catherine Bradshaw. Cinematography is stunning. The result is solid in the plot. The story is an epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Qureshi in a worldly life. This story deals with great issues with the accuracy of Impressionism painting. Some of these big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won out, despite many nominations. It's simply one of my favorite films at all.
