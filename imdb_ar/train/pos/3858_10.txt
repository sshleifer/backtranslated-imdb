Paul Vierhoffen's American cars are of varying quality, but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable works of art. This is the story of an alcoholic writer (bisexual) who travels with a rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the handsome woman's lover. In the meantime, the writer suffers from strange visions - at first looks like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he quickly began to realize that he already suffers a kind of batons. The Hitchcockian movie is an exciting magician, very original and provocative. I like the movies that make you think they are revolving around something, but then you realize they are revolving around something completely different. This is one of those films. A thrilling film during the first half, a semi-religious surreal epic during the second half. Very erotic, original kayaking, not for children or people who go to the church every Sunday. A great cinematography by the future director Jean de Bon. Highly recommended!
