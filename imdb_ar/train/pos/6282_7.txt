Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who was forced out of retirement when forced to save his life from his brother Kepp (Giovanni Ribesi) when he was working in a job, by completing his brothers to steal 50 cars in one night. He has to collect his old crew so he can trust him to help him pull him out and bring out his Dutch brothers. But the police on him, can you pull him? This was one of the biggest candidates for the film, which was redrafted because the original was not classical. If you do not enter into this much anticipated command, turn off the reflection part of your mind so you can ignore the sketch slot, just take the movie to see what it is. You will end up enjoying the trip. Watch it on a double bill with "Fasting and Angry" to spend a superhero night at speed, just do not take the car for a spin straight afterwards. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: B - <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 7 minute interview with Jerry Bruckheimer; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography. Overwork: Highlight the reel. The "Cultured On The Heart" trailer; trailer and trailer for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
