I watched the film before I read Michel Magorian's book and enjoyed it. The film, more than the book, made me closer to crying on several occasions. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never leaves it. I encourage as many people to see this masterpiece as possible and as soon as possible. I give it ten stars.
