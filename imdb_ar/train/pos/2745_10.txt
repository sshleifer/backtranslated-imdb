I've seen many great movies, but Cold Blood stands alone in a single row. It excels in every department. The fact that it contains a few large stars helps push it to the top, paying more attention to characters and their stories, rather than the name in the rectangle. Blake and Wilson turn into an excellent performance for the deadly double star. The fact that so many movies are filmed at the actual locations where the crime occurred, even inside the house, adds additional chills. Black and white photography darkens the mood and is wonderful. There are many great cinematic works out there, but if I can only vote for one of them at the top of the list, it is likely to be "cold blood."
