Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-time online fan-only movie that has been completely performed for series love and must be seen by Trek lovers. Production quality is very high for a fan movie, although sometimes you can say it's a green screen. This does not take away from the overall experience. The CGI line is fantastic as well as battle scenes space ... On the downside, I can say in previous episodes (and sometimes even in the newer) that some actors / actresses are not quite comfortable with the roles, but again, this does not take away from the overall experience For new interpretations of Star Trek. The crew and crew have really come to something special here, and in general, I highly recommend this series to next-generation fans and Deep Space 9.
