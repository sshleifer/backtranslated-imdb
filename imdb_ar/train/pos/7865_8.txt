Great movie. The story is very refreshing and interesting. Not once throughout the film did I find myself staring into space. Conkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think someone who had more sparkle or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this film, the story is wonderful, very realistic, it does not beat the jungle, it is very honest in sending its message. I think it should be a movie like this. I'm fed up with watching the same candy line movies again and again, as it's hard to digest now. Everyone should watch page 3, it's a great movie. , Just my 2 cents :)
