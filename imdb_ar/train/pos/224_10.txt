Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I first saw it when it was a Christmas attraction in Radio City Music Hall when I first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing him 6 times in theaters, and if playing today I would go out to see him again. <br /> <br /> Now many of the reviews here mention great offers. Matthau was wonderful, but he had the misfortune to nominate the Oscar-winning Randall P. MacMurphy to Jack Nicholson in "One Fly Over the Cuckoo." Burns achieved a win, although Richard Benjiman deserved at least a nomination. Such as the Fritz Field test of commercial potato chips. <br /> <br /> This has made me return to my area to review this film, a highly disliked direction by Herbert Ross, who plays "The Owl And The Pussycat" on Screen and make a full movie of it, do it again, and opens the plays without making them look like a play photography, and take out the We are here 20 minutes before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clarke comes to see his uncle and tell him about his own comedy film.Play in the first 20 minutes, the sequence itself is brand new. A few years ago, I watched the revival of Broadway with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful, but I think Ross and the scriptwriter, playwright Simon, have improved on him.
