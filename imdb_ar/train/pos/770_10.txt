I love Theodore Cheryl, and that's probably why I enjoyed this movie so much. Two days before the premiere of the film I went to see his concert. I saw the video and video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I was calculating everything .. I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I helped a great movie! I felt the movie. It was sad ... it was funny .. but most of all it depicts love .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I will not be :) I'm not a film critic .. I can not describe it with more words My mysterious recipes are everything because the play left me speechless. Thank you for theodore giorgio, thank you Maria bobistasu, thank you Ioana Barbo and thank you Theodore Cherylia. Handsome! :)
