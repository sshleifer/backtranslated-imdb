During 1933, this film got many cuts because it surpassed the top of the story content and the fact that Lilly Bowers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to get a great fortune and strength. Lili's father forced his daughter to practice prostitution at the age of 14 and grew up in a steel factory in a town where she was very poor. Her father ran a house that brought all sorts of male characters to her house. As the story progresses, Laila meets one man after another and finally finds a man who has everything and is the head of a flirtatious bank. It's great to see John McCoy Jr., who was only 25 years old when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not reach the first base with Lilly, not even for lunch. George Brent is very young (Coutland Trenholm) plays starring with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave great performances. This wonderful 1933 film was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was kept in error for many years and has recently been shown on the silver screen. This film is fairly mild compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty watching this kind of movies. Enjoy
