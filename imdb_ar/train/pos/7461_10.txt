It can be compared to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I, Sixth Sense and others. This film approaches the soul in a way it has never done before. The first 30 minutes create an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is confusing, well, you'll choose more every time you see it (I went to the movies to watch it 3 times now)
