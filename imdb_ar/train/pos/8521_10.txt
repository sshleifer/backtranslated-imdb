I definitely love this show. I watched it from the time it first appeared in the late 1990s until the last episode. In my honest opinion the wonderful family drama was very rare these days. Definitely a show you can watch it with your friend or children. Yes, things have changed a bit with Joe since the last time we saw them in books, but they are still compelling with wonderful stories and good lessons. The actress, who starred Joe Bayer (Michelle Burke), is doing a great job, like the actress Nick Riley (Spencer Rochefort) during the series, who learns about the development of romance between Joe and Nick as well as stories and daily lessons children and students learn. I would recommend this show to anyone.
