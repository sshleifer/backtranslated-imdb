All the people who sit here and say that the weak link to this film are the Ramones, they might say that Amadeus was fine if not for this angry guitar. The Rock and Roll Secondary School was centered around Ramones. How anyone can see this and do not come out of Joe Ramon who is eating bean sprouts in the backstage trying to keep him in performance, it is clear that the blanket box is wet. Mrs. Trogar, the white rat bursts, the patrol room ... classic instantaneous. If you do not like Ramones characters, you do not know rock and roll and do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
