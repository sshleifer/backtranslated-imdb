The movie revolves around Pony more than Gray Owl. It is also related to Aboriginals, Canada, English and Gray's Owl cousins ​​and North Bay. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent film, much like a book, that raises interesting questions about identity and cultural values. The main scene is the Gray Owl confesses to be told to Bonnie and her reaction. <br /> <br /> Some notes about user ratings. Note that user ratings are bipolar groups in 5 and 7; this is not for everyone, but has strong followers. This film is minimized and ignored, but will be observed for years to come. Also, a few women watched the movie but they performed it more than men. Has it been marketed correctly? <br /> <br />
