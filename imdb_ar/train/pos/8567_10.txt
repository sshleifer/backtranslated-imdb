I enjoyed the film and I suggest that anyone go out for a good time. Do not take the movie seriously because it is remembered as a Disney production and was rated G. It is fun and clean although some parts may be recognized by adults but children will never notice, especially the "Triangle" between Cruella and Le Pelt and Cruella faithful server Alonso . Glenn Close is truly wonderful and truly credible. Even when she is "cured" of her fur-loving ways, she can instill fear in her audience with her dodgers that literally shake the theater. (So ​​I found myself jumping in my seat when I realized the surprise of "her" as a dog-loving elea). All in all I will go and see her again in the theaters, I found myself enjoying her a lot.
