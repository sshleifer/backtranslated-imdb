. . . It is as good as the original. Achieve greatness almost because of Cundieff's brilliant ear for music and dialogue. Engage hip-hop skill of self-importance. The group "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) is a collection of rap music that I have ever heard and that is completely self-deprecating. The wardrobe is unbelievable. Buy OOP soundtracks if you can.
