Due to low budget and production constraints, this film is very good. It is logical and realistic and shows how the Hungarian cavalry who lived in the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a pitiful American pilot from the Nazis. We are attracted to strong feelings of youth and sense of impression, after a very brave boy - who admires the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings - this movie is not for you, if you want to feel what it should be to avoid stubborn and immoral Nazis and their lack of empathy, you will enjoy this movie, I really enjoyed it and those who love horses Dogs, humble people, helpers who appreciate freedom, and those who aspire to achieve this goal, this film will be one you will remember for a long time.
