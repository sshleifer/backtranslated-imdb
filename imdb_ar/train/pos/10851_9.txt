I found that "still crazy" is pleasantly enjoyable, not just for those of us who lived in that bustling era of the late 1960s and early 1970s. My 15-year-old daughter watches with me every time I pull the DVD (do not worry, it was only three times) and she likes it too. <br /> <br /> It is a truly loving and moving funny gesture of the age, and every actor records his / her remarks perfectly. This was my first introduction to Bill Niggi, and I am pleased that his somewhat similar role in "Love Actually" drew his attention even more. Bruce Robinson was unbelievable like Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of stereotypes of rock-damaged drugs. It was interesting to see that Robinson had made a good name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the film Billy Connolly hit at a local mall (he was living here at the time) and told him it was one of my favorite five films of all time. He invited me to sit in the dining room with him and we discussed the film for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​American-style remake before wisely rejecting it. Why tamper with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that they are not very popular in the theaters and that many people have missed a great experience.
