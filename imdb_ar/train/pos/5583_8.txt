I gathered at least a few people I saw on September 2 on traditional Chinese medicine. If you know that Hadi had to change her name to avoid her association with this film when she came to the United States, it was a big scandal and I am unanimous that the original version in the United States was so overly overlooked by the observers that it was practically incomprehensible. I watched because I just saw a documentary about "Bad Women" and actresses in the former US film control panel created in the early 1930s. It seemed to me that they had escaped more than Hardy's "sensational" shots in the movie "Ecstasy". In fact Hedy looked positively innocent in this, according to today's standards, it was nice to see her early pristine beauty. It was a nice movie to relax in. I loved him for what he was: a simple love story. I saw it after it was recorded in advance during early sleep. I would love to see the first version released in the United States for comparison.
