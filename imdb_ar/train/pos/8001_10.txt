Definitely one of the coolest movies I have seen for some time. The wonderful direction and flawless representation makes this film very entertaining and often moving. Denzel Washington plays one of his most attractive and emotional roles so far, and the rest of the actors perform wonderfully. Christopher Wheln is of course wonderful for him though he did not appear as much as I wish. The story of ultimate greed is counterproductive to innocence and child love. It is also a film for motion picture lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. Mexico City adds a sense of sedition and corruption, which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a film is really sweeping from start to finish. Highly recommended!
