The diagnosis of homicide has been shown most of the afternoon on BBC1 since I was used to watching it while I was sick from school 10 years ago - I know I should not really enjoy it, the same way I should not enjoy it "Murder she Wrot" But I'm totally addicted to both and even have DVD sets .... well, I know this is sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyck holds the program while Dr.Mark Sloan is attending a community hospital Los Angeles is also a Los Angeles police police consultant - his son Steve (Barry Van Dyck - your real life son) is a police officer, who needs help from his father in cases of death A suspicious breed. <br /> <br /> Throughout the trip, Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), a pathologist at Community General, and the first and second seasons of Scott Bayou's life with Dr. Jack Stewart, 1995 hoping to go to bigger and better things ... he had to reside in his place, he has not done anything since then .... he was his only theatrical appearance for many years in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Dear !!! <br /> <br /> However, Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by Dr.Jesse Travis, played by Charlie Schlatter, who stepped up to Baio's shoes comfortably. <br /> <br /> Serial is pretty unbelievable but what is the Whodunit series? (The murder was written - everywhere Jessica goes, someone ends up, or the secrets of Dowling abandoned father around the priest of the murder solution with a nun). <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997, because supporting actors included The director of the glittering Norman Bruges Hospital performed by Michael Toochi, along with Dolores Nurse and Mark, played by Delores Hull. After 1997, these characters are no longer listed and the series has become an affair with a larger budget. The episodes included further actions, one episode being blown up in the entire hospital. <br /> <br /> This was a family show for Van Dyck because, as well as the son of Barry Dick, you also had a dick's daughter and all his grandchildren made appearances in various episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series continues, it is very ridiculous, one episode I remember that Dick Van Dyck played by all his family, which was a bit unusual, but in its entirety was a "murder diagnosis" really good TV show It has many guest stars. <br /> <br /> Since the show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry has again appeared in the "MURDER 101" series of TV films produced by The Hallmark Channel, beautiful after much of the same track, and still enjoyable. Dick, now in his mid-80s, does not seem to have changed much, and it seems as if he will work until the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV Show **** OUT OF *** **
