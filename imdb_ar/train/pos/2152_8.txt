There have been some great moments of reality depicting modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how the culture of those can be choked, and the desire to get out of the mold that was created for you. <br /> <br /> Dancing was just a way to say, "Do what you love even if it's against al-Qaeda." Rather Billy Elliott as I would say. I enjoyed this movie too. <br /> <br /> The humor was timed, and I felt the moments that were touching the reality. You might feel embarrassed between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - make it a wig and overtake it in the dance floor simply howl! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job, and the story was well written. I saw it for the second time and discovered some subtle differences that I missed in the first viewing. Good entertainment!
