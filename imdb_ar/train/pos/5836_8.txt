Yes, as other reviewers have already noted, this may not be an old L & H, but it is far from being as bad as it was in the twentieth century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly contains all the essential ingredients of things that must go wrong for boys. But this approach is serious and the design makes it funny. They do not play for laughter as other comedians do, but they take their actions and put them seriously and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they face some of the fundamental problems that any of us may face today, the pressures associated with the job. First, we will examine it by a doctor and describe some of the comfort he needs most and perhaps spend on the sea. This is where surrealism comes to all this. L & H always takes a range of reasonable and exaggerated circumstances but never to an incredible degree, except perhaps once in a moment. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their own predicaments that caused themselves and attempts at landing. This is what makes Stan and the world-wide in their appeal. In this film, all those ingredients are presented in a wonderful and dazzling manner. It is not the best they have compared to their previous work, perhaps because this was the last actual film they made for Roach because he wanted to reflect the "big" studios and go to the exclusive feature industry and also want to speed up their contractual obligations. big mistake! All of them should have stayed together and continued for another five years. What the world has missed is not being considered an option. Watch, laugh, and enjoy this as her last great performance.
