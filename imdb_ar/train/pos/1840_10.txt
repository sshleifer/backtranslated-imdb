Fantastic screenplay and some of the best actors ever produced by the world. Montand gives the concept of the "sole wolf" police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop loses a family, friends and pets to kill him is usually given a minute of grief. But when the 60th is over, he gathers himself up, packs his gun and shoots his enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> However, Mark Fairot, from Montand, has already been destroyed - by killing his friends of course, but also by knowing she had another mistress. In his confusion and anger, does not seek revenge, but needs to continue to search for the perpetrator of the real crime where his fingerprints are at the scene. And so all his actions become indescribably logical. This is the main reason why we resort to our seats but certainly not the only one.
