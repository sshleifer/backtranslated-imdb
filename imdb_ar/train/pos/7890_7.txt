Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was Freddie Krueger's latest film as a solo (not as an actor or co-star). The years of murder have affected the city of Springwood. It has reached the point that the small city has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddie Krueger several years ago paid the final price. Only Mad Town dwellers and survivors are everywhere. But this does not prevent Freddy from looking for his final revenge. No matter how they tried to stop him, he always goes back for more information. But this time he discovered more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy forever? What is this secret buried in Freddy's twisted mind? To discover that you will have to watch Freddy's Dead. The end is shot in the original 3D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to end a franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and about his perverted life and gets out! Liza Zan and his fans Cotto and Freddie Krueger starred in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the last one but it is full of some dated jokes. If you enjoy the series, you do not want to miss watching this series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to Freddy's fans.
