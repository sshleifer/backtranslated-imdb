I found this flick in a video store and it cost $ 2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The alleged Colonel, who was the hero here if he could be trusted, must be in his 80s and can not walk. However, he managed to shoot the world's dumbest ninja. The story then leaves the colonel, which makes sense in view of the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning. He now takes two men who look scary in the 1980s, while there must be some kind of story. I have lost a hundred times but I do not mind, because the film is very bad, it's very interesting to see it. Zero budget waste with representatives do not deserve that name. Go check it out!
