Offside is the story of teenage girls trying to sneak into the stadium to watch the final of the World Cup in Tehran, which could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Women are prohibited from going to the stadium by law in Iran, although many are dressed like boys and sneak in. The stadium guards look at each one at the entrance to make sure no one is carrying fireworks and of course; no girl enters. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's work, the cast's performance was impressive. You really think you're watching a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the soldiers were carefully and surprisingly prepared. The film depicts the interactions between prisoners and guards who serve Mandartori away from their families and friends in a funny way. In the end, the public knows that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards who followed orders only.
