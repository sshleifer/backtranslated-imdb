Well, here's what I think of Jack Frost. I looked at the vortex box of the VHS tape and I said to myself, this sounds interesting. I hired her and took her home. The boy was right, he was interesting. They put the lives of the serial killer in dreams, in walking bodies and inside machines every day. But this must be the most privileged place to develop a serial killer spirit. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the pictures of the friendly snowman who were scattered over the landscape, the pot holder, the snowball, and so on. I love the actor who played Jack, put some fun in the killer never seen since Freddie Krueger. That's right, I said so. Freddy Kruger. It is a "wonderful" level. I hope some puppet effects are better, and mouth movements may be better. But I chalk that up to a small budget. The team does a great job, there are a lot of hooligans to scare any fan of horror. Everything, wonderful story, good effects, wonderful dialogue and wonderful actors. I give JACK FROST ... 9 Stars
