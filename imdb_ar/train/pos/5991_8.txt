The sequel to the Angels with filthy faces in the name only, the Angels wash their faces suffer somewhat from the usual tricks of children deadlocked. In fact, with Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as an actual complement to Angels with Dirty Faces, at least for continuity. <br /> <br /> A recent talk about Ann Sheridan is the true bright light of this film. To rework the cliches, Ann Sheridan was reading from a phone book for two hours and I would buy a DVD! <br /> <br /> Another advantage of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the movie is kept away in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
