After first making his debut with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan rushed back into the spotlight with Project A of 1983, a very fun flick re-established as a major star. By the time the Police Story was released two years later, the unusual hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its peak, and the crowds were gathering to see this frantic mix of spectacular stunts, brutal fighting scenes and dubious comedy. He broke many box office records and inspired a 50 percent increase in police recruits, but after 20 years - is that good? <br /> <br /> The action film Police Story undoubtedly stands. There are many wonderful fighting scenes, some wise actions that refer to the best in the Champion Chan Buster Keaton, and a very violent rocky quarrel. Jackie's performance is strong as well. While the hard-hitting comic-book invasions weaken the effect of the film a bit, its appeal carries it. Moreover, in presenting our hero as a linear specialist on the border and who recklessly jeopardizes others, Jackie has faced an important gamble ... although in the case of what someone seems to have noticed! By praising Police Story as a simple "good versus evil" battle, film critics played down the mystery of the tone in the film. While it is difficult for the Karamazov brothers to portray such ambiguity, the film nevertheless represents a remarkable and commendable shift from ideas Traditional. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie remains a high-quality "popcorn" (although you may empty your stomach because the bad guys are heading or sitting in glass facades in the last scene of the film) - a powerful action film and a line combinator with a better period .
