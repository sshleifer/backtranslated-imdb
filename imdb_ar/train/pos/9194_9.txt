I first encountered this show when I was living in Japan for six months last year. I found it in the Internet when I was looking for a title-based drama to help me with the Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was strange, but I found it delightful! Koyuki showed such conflicting personality traits and the spirit of Matsujun made everyday every time I tuned in! I first saw him on "Hana Yori Dango", but I loved him better in this! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed when I found that they did not change much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they did not really do it. Still, it was a fun time by everyone (even for Fukushima!).
