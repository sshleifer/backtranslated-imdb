This figure was raised 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Provides an insight into something I hardly understand - wave surfers because they are all they want to do; nothing else seems important to them like surfing; nor is it something temporary - it is the age of these men * buried in I have never surfed, but I like to browse movies, and I've seen a lot. No one taught me what this movie did * The movie was well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were fascinating * Interesting from beginning to end <br /> <br /> In short, it's as good as the documentary I saw, so I must make it. So 10/10
