Although The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone not to get upset by Jack Nicholson going crazy. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to erase it; instead, it has been repeatedly referred to in pop culture. Twin, Bloody Elevator, RedRum, Crazy "Waffle" "Writing" ... You should see this, if not anything else, to understand all the hints of it in everyday life. The film is simultaneously scary, impressive, beautiful, and intriguing psychological. It contains the classic puzzle of Hitchcock and the terror of modern excitement. And what he usually lacks horror movies: a wonderful scenario.
