When I was young, I always hated a kind of "Cinderella", because I was told about my sister when my dad was thinking about buying a Disney movie. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won it, and we got the "Cinderella". I enjoyed the movie completely during my sleep at the back of the room and played with my characters from Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> Much has changed since then. My love for the Disney theme parks I had a training period at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young daughters. I loved showing them Disney as much as possible and we recently saw Cinderella together. With my new appreciation of everything Disney is, I watched Cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I have not fully understood why Cinderella was locked in a terrible predicament. Why was she a slave to her family, and why could not she escape? I was not sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story unfolded, I found myself drowning in the story. Perhaps the attractive cartoon attracted me or the fun-loving characters, or perhaps the timeless songs. Listening to songs such as "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is Your Heart Makes" made me go back to the playgrounds. I can imagine myself in this quiet and pleasant atmosphere while looking at the stunning Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this Disney movie conjures up. This may make a lot of people make fun of it, but go to the magical kingdom and watch all the little girls who wear clothes like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantastic world and you have to know what I'm talking about. Cinderella pictures and glass slippers - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - make Disney one of the most beloved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While Cinderella may not be the strongest story, it's a kind of icon in Disney and the history of cinema. It represents this interesting and idealistic wonder similar to the imagination we carried when we were young. I imagine that this film carries a lot of meaning to many people there. It may not be my favorite film for Disney, but it's all I like and liked about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating is: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (outstanding)
