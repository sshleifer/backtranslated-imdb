Pakeezah has a very interesting history (well documented in the "Trivia" section) about how it happens. It seems as if fate plotted to test Kamal Amrohi (director) while at the same time secretly wanting to see him complete a masterpiece. As a result, the intensity of the emotion exits a dimension that may not be very real but very effective and leave an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Mina Kumari lives with the tragedy of Nargis and the owner of her king Jean. Other stars in the film are Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangishkar, Noshad (background) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinematography are left within certain limits. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. Reveals you new layers every time you see them again. Kamal Amrouhi is one of the rare poets of the cinema and left us every gift.
