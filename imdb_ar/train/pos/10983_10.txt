"Gray Gardens" (1975) is the strange documentary by the brothers of the Maysels about the aunt of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and the center of his first cousin who lives like a pig in a 28-room mansion in East Hampton, Long Island. 78, witty and dry and her daughter, "Little Eddie" Bill, 56, (emotionally about 13) is a beautiful woman who still had a promising future, living in isolation from the rest of the world except for many cats and animals raccoon in the attic. They like themselves through bickering all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (they do not even have a television). Their fall out of society is amazing to learn and the viewer is attracted to these two very special characters, although they are obviously the ones who invented one of the best documentaries ever made and still a classic cult today.
