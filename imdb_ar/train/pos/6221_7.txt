If this movie was put together better, there would be better with Aster and Rogers. As it is, it is a wonderful but very long film with a boring sub-plot, the sister of Randolph Scott of Morocco, Rogers, played by Harriet Heliard (this is the wife of Azi Nielson for you babies). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are naval men. Scott meets Hilliard the first time she looks like a typical librarian, and then after Ginger Rogers asked her friend (more like a blond but unambiguous blonde) to dazzle her. At the same time, Astaire is trying to capture the place where he and his old partner are dancing. The result is some great dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team, as well as separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let Yourself Go" and "I like Rather Lead the Band." Heliard is sweet but somewhat inactive when Jane Mini turns into a charming girl, although she sings her song well, "But where are you?" And "Get behind me, devil" - one of the posters did not care about that song, but I love the title. Rogers is full of vitality, and the young Astaire is Dynamo. <br /> <br /> The film finally comes with "Let's Face Music and Dance", one of the most painful songs ever, and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by Rogers and Esther. In it, they embody the magic of the 30s and imagination. Is really to be proud and see again and again.
