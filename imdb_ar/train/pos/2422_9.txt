Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's first films, but it's probably funnier! John Candy has not yet been removed from the days of SCTV in "Going Berserk" and it appears. If he does not crack when Candy tries to help a man in his own grocery store while handcuffing with his girlfriends with sex with his girlfriend just with the door of the apartment that separates them (huh ?, watch the movie!), Or the way Euguene Levy Yu) with his mother on the phone, or just a myriad of facial expressions that Candy can give you only. If you like John Candy from "Only the Lonely", this may not be a movie I would recommend watching, but if you enjoy John Kandy's SCTV, you should watch this movie!
