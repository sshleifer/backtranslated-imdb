Just two comments ... seven years apart? Hardly evidence of the power of pulling the film relentlessly! As mentioned above, the low-budget TV condition of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited attractiveness. Having said that, it is not without merit - either for recreation or for a walk in itself. <br /> <br /> True, the plot in its simplest form is to restart the movie AMITYVILLE HORROR - just without much horror. More intriguing issue! Gibbney may have made an interesting impression if Halifax played an investigation into a few murders that appeared unrelated to the "home" as her main suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall output is of a high standard. It failed to attract the viewer, especially at the core moments. <br /> <br /> After picking up a DVD for only $ 3.95 last week at the usual video store, I can not predict the expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
