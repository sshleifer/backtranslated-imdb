Klausen's film is typical, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. It's a really wonderful film about natural people who live a normal life and try to benefit from it. The four main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonia Richter plays a nurse who is actually a representative, but she turns out to be the best nurse to take care of the old man. Everyone has problems and those who do not believe in the end end up happy. But nothing good comes easily, they have to fight in order to earn their lives and their love.
