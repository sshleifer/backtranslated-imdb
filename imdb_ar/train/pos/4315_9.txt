I have seen this film again and remain dissatisfied with the number of cynics who reject it as just a new era. It's a wonderful film, it takes a long time to develop, it keeps getting closer to progress but never happens, and in the end it's more meditative, influential, and truthful in life than most of the films that are excluded by people who reject its "scars". I was furious at the time of nominating films such as Prince Tide and Bugsy (although I loved the latter) for the best picture of that year (not to mention winning the Silent Lambs movie!) This was completely ignored except for one nomination for Best Scenario. When reconsidered, I think history supports my initial reaction!
