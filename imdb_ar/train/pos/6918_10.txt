A very interesting movie featuring characters who do bad things and allow feelings like anger and desire for revenge. The cast is very good, and there is a lot of work, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with evolution) in the end. I have watched this movie several times and always watch it when it is on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
