The Unborn is a completely different film. James Karen Brooke Brook Adams in the film performed well. This movie accumulates strongly and keeps you going. Although I think it must be a horror fan to watch this because of the viewer and the plot. There is one short sexual scene without nudity that can be ruled out, and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me who belongs to the film and thinks things ruin a good film but that's when it comes to it. There is a scene where Adams turns into nuts and kills a cat but you can say it is not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in My Ray is a really creepy and unpredictably wonderful movie that's so weird! I recommend all horror lovers to this movie!
