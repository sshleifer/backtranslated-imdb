I am happy because this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and elegance on blinking lights with empty heads and continuous loud noise. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you have a short period of attention or lack the intelligence and imagination you can handle a literary story you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are very simple, but rarely fulfilled: Matthew Jacobs has done a great job in successfully transferring the story of Catherine Sturr's "Marian Dreams" to a screenplay. An unenviable task like anyone who has seen a film for a book that will undoubtedly be known. <br /> <br /> The film is great, with director Bernard Rose using actors in a way you rarely see now; they indulge in acting! I know, I know, that actors act and act rather than resort to unusual theft in the lens of the camera, while a scene of car chase, explosions and firefights that occur around them, is really rare, but actually happens in this film . <br /> <br /> This leads me to the last reason that this film is for the imaginative thinker and not the spice-laden tabloid - apart from the powerful scenario, direction and representation - it depends on the atmosphere, suspense and implied terror. If it should be classified as horror, the "Paper House" display is in the context of Sophocles more than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you love a lot of loud noise and bangs and fixed it is best to see "Transformers", but if you love an exciting story and reveal through the use of skillful and sexy narration without insulting your intelligence by feeding you with comic power, This may be just nonsense.
