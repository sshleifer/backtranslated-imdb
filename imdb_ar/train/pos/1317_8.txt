This anime was still scornful. Barely the dorky children's film as described, I still go back to these ten years after I first saw it. One of the best films released. <br /> <br /> Animation, though not perfect, is good, but the tricks of the camera give it a three-dimensional feeling and the story is still good today even after I have grown up and seen great pioneers such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. There is nowhere near the rear clearly but try to see it from a funny point of view. It's a story of entertainment, not a question. <br /> <br /> I'm still one of the favorites I come back to when I feel like laughing more than cartoons. In order not to say that they are childish films, there are amazing sad moments in this and you need a sense of humor to see them all.
