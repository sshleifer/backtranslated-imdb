There are other reviews here, so I do not need to say how great or what it is ... My point is: I've heard about this film a long time ago, before it was released. I can not even remember how, I know it was online. Distributors went before they arrive! For months I bike and complained. Please note that there is a link on this page to purchase this movie and that the only featured area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish from Alta Vista for translation. I know that PAL format and they changed the text on the screen to German, and there is a little narration in the beginning which is also called in German, but this movie is hilarious and delightful, and it makes it more entertaining! If you want to watch this movie and have nearby remittances, it's worth it! It cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the United States from Germany. Trust me, it may seem like you're spending a lot on a movie, but if you're in obscene clicks, you'll make money on the left and right that gets conversions for your friends!
