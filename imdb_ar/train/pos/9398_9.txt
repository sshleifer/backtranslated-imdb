It is a wonderful film in modern times .... "excellent" because it is interesting, from start to finish. There are some holes here and some shiny parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I did not find anyone who was not preoccupied with this story. The film enjoys the appropriate amount of action, thrill, changes in the plot and interesting characters. In addition, there are some fine colors and cinematography as well as good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This crime film is described as "Noir film" because it is brave and all characters are not good. Even the only supposed man, played by Nicholas Cage, faces himself in trouble by lying and has a quick romantic relationship he should not have. As he does something wrong in the end, but I will not spoil him by saying. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Talking about "bad guys", does anyone do that better than Denis Hopper? not much. At least in the category of "dysfunctional", difficult to overcome. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to see a bunch of reasons. JT Walsh offers a great supportive performance as well. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has not received much publicity, but it should be. You'll have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie aloud three times quickly without tampering with it!
