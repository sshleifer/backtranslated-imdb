Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to take up a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the stage stopped - although it does not carry a strong box. However, a nice lady aboard the plane hides $ 10,000 for her and for her brother's business ... The thieves seem to know it. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle for the job. However, soon learn that this uncle is a jerk - the usual bad guy of the Westerners. You know, a rich man who just wants to become richer by cheating, stealing and even threatening to own everything. It happened that this jerk was behind the theft. Scott demands that Uncle return the money and then Scott deals with the gentle lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is not the end of problems --- just a beginning. Repeatedly, conspiracies of various kinds occur to try to crush Uncle's opposition. One trick is to bring a beautiful lady to Scott and his associates. It's a wonderful shot and it seems bad for Scott - so he finds out why she's coming to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike the subsequent Randolph Scott films, Scott is portrayed as a more intense man. In his films he is often the last to suggest violence, but in this film he hastens to propose execution (screw in law, let's get Hanjin) and soon threatens his uncle. What a surprise to see him as a hothead - although in most other ways, it is the same old Scott that you expect. <br /> <br /> As for the film, there is nothing particularly unusual about it. Gaby plays Hayes usual character, Scott is the hero, can not be the reason behind it is the destruction of the beggar and the destruction of Scott to the girl in the end. Although this plot is very typical, it is all handled very well and as a result it is worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the film. First, in the late film, there is a fight going on between Scott and Uncle # 1, Lenny Chaney, Junior. In it, Chani smokes as he fights - something I have never seen before, and I was impressed how he managed to blow away because he got his kick with a butt. Second, get a load of the sight of a fugitive with a whip - now that was an impossible achievement!
