I've seen this during the Christmas period, I do not know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I saw it, so we're here. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie I watch all the time with a big stupid smile on my face, a mix of specials, Jolly's great music, and a clever and magic script that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character he can hate very easily (pampered, rich, drunk drunk, sorry for himself) but turns it into someone you love. Lisa Minelli is as wonderful as Linda Morola, a waitress queens managed to get rid of the cruel / soft on the lady inside, Arthur, gave up his world. John Gilgod gets all the exciting lines and polished them with taste. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again which makes me feel good, check it out if you need to raise his beautiful movie.
