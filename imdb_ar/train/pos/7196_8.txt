As the series continue, Zorro's Fighting Legion is one of the best action series of the 1930s. This period, in which studios were still capable of presenting a large group of actors, was characterized by wall-to-wall walls throughout its 12 seasons. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the newly appointed President of Mexico, Benito Ju√°rez Carlton Young) is trying to put his new country on a strong financial base. To this end, he arranged to send rich gold shipments to the Capitol from the San Mendolita local mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council plot to steal cargo on behalf of Don Del Oro The Golden Armored Armor, who helps the local Yakui tribe, hopes to prove himself governor of Mexico. He is opposed by Don Francisco (Guy Dinery) who formed a corps of locals to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is killed by the men of Don Del Oro, a stranger, arrives without Diego (Red Hadley) to the city. Diego, nicknamed Zoro, takes over the Corps with the help of his friends Ramon (William Curson) and Juan (Bod Buster). The heroine of the piece is the sister of Ramon Vulita (Sheila Darcy). <br /> <br /> Diego and Ramon occupy two seats in the ruling local council. It soon becomes clear that some other members of the Council are cooperating with Don Del Oro. First, there is the President of the Council (Linder de Cordova), the head of the Manuel Militia (John Merton), the Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzules (Edmund Cobb). Zoro suspects that one of these men is Don Del Oro, but which one of them? <br /> <br /> The following are several cases of hair escape by Zoro and his allies of Don Del Oro. Our current bridge collapse rope, the deep gap between the two cliffs that Zorro can only jump into safety, a variety of explosions, fire, coaches and vehicles crash or pass over the abyss. Here you go to a wonderful Republican team of amazing men led by the legendary Yakima Kanout Werguins, Bill and Joe. Kanut leads his signature trick to jump on a team of fugitive horses and then fall under the coach he repeated in other films including John's "Stagecoach" in the same year. Don Del Oro and restore peace to the valley before setting off for sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other actors in the team include Jim Pierce, Corelli Dresden and Charlie King as men from Don Del Oro. If you look closely, you can locate bits by a future serial star and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and Canutt stuntman in bits. By the way, it may be better to remember "Pierce" Jim Pierce because he played Tarzan in 1927 in the movie "Tarzan and the Golden Day" (1927) and his marriage to Juan Burroughs daughter of the creator of Tarzan Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
