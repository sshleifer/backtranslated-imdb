In "Love Crimes" by Lizzy Borden (1992), Sean Young plays an amazing role. In Atlanta. She is the only one deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergen), who represents a famous fashion photographer and lures women, picks up bargaining pictures for them, and then leaves them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this hard-line person decides to enter the life of the fake buster by pretending to be his prey and intends to bring him to justice. They meet, and they love, and then the next thing you know, it is on his room, and clap. (Note: The buttock scene only exists in the "Unclassified" version of this movie.) The version that has been classified by R has been deleted and many other scenes that will make the plot more obvious.) This psychological film includes many scenes of female nudity and images The nuisance, like Bergen chasing one of his victims all over the room, flies a ride. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young plays her role-playing game mouse with Bergen, in an attempt to arrest him for a criminal offense. Unfortunately, the film does not end, it just stops. That's true. Perhaps the director Lizzie Borden ran out of the story to tell her, but after 92 minutes, the credits began to leave us, and we were right "What just happened?" Confused. <br /> <br /> Young's plan, which began to appear in an attractive fashion, is presented, but the lack of a coherent end would be a stop for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (Daniladoro @ yahoo.com)
