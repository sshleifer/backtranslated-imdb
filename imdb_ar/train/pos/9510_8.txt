In the winter of 1931, 12-year-old Tyler Hutchinson (like Michael Sullivan Jr.) is supposed to wonder what his mob father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) is doing for a living. Hwichlien follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one night and attests to him attacking some rival gangs. This, in a very twisted fashion, leads to "Godfather" - the type Paul Newman (like John Rooney) who has appointed Independent Independent's Harley Maginer's Jude Law to track Hoechlin and Hanks, who will be cool in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you think of the character line. <br /> <br /> Looks like a repellent like Paul Peterson ("Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a great job by director Sam Mendes; working with this actor makes him the best actor of 2002. But the most surprising thing about "Road" to Perdition "is the stunning cinematic portrayal of Conrad L. Hall, which won the Oscar for the late photographer. Mr. Hall was a really wonderful job. This helps to offset the general impression of the measured and contradictory recession of both narrative and visual images. The drifting end suddenly lifts (the dog that has nothing to do with it is an example of the aforementioned recession). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoeklin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
