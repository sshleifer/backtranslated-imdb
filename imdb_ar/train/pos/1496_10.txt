I enjoyed taking this movie very late from the late TV and kept my attention throughout the whole picture. This wonderful and delightful English house, with sinister decorations, exquisite furniture and rooms, makes you wonder why anyone wants to rent or own this house. There are four (4) stories about this house, and every resident in the house meets all sorts of problems. You'll notice the beautiful lake and the pool all around the house as well as the sweet singing of the birds, but do not let this fool you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80-year-old performance as a wonderful person living at home and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Scarlet altar", 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reed) To read WITCHCRAFT books! If you like scary and mysterious movies, with lots of surprises, this is the right movie for you !!!!
