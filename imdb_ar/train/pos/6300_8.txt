I loved this movie I thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget. I've run out after watching this to buy a DVD, obv can not be forgotten easily! <br /> <br /> The script is awesome and can not be the best choice. Every character has her moment, and laughed hard throughout this film, the comedy time was topical. <br /> <br />
