This can be 10 if it is not a Hollywood predictor scenario. Daniel Day Lewis confirms his position as one of the main actors of our time (why not ask the lead) and the rest of the stands at a very high level. I personally liked Hugh or Connor, who played Christie Brown as a child. The first scene I saw was very strong. Wonderful.
