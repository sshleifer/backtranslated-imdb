Along with Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever produced. It's a real shame that it's not as famous as previous films (perhaps because it sticks to a mythology-based story instead of contemporary settings or science fiction, it's British, and it means a smaller market for movies) but it's nice to know that it deserves that reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all great family movies, one can be a child, adult or even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I am 18 years old), but one must first appreciate classic movies. I adore this film perfectly. Featuring an unusual musical score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps the result of my favorite classic film) which competes with any of John Williams' Star Wars points, at a fast pace but not glamorous, beautiful collections, dialogue, and color use (both groups and cinematography won a prize) Oscars), and the special effects of the recent Academy Award (for time, some of which are still amazing). Of course, the doctrine of Jun Dobriz looks like a rival to the princess like Catherine Zeta-Jones (she even looks like Jones in some way!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of all I have favorite time for the film (next to Robin Hood Adventures) and really deserves more attention. It's a real adventure of magic all over, along with Robin Hood, a desert island film that I can watch over and over again without being disturbed. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
