I went to this film thinking it would be a great B-type movie. I came out very surprised and infiltrated. Eva was good, but Bill Lake stole the show. It had an amazing comic timing. The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two jokes. The plot was enough to tie them together. A woman dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman who will come out with her husband, who would become her husband. Her sounds seem elusive but in fact they work perfectly well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - In general, it's a worthwhile movie viewing, if you do not get it on the DVD when it appears.
