I found this film to be a wonderful study of a family in crisis. When Liu, the oldest, declares he is HIV positive, the reactions of family members on their own and with each other are still touching and strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family like this physical character; no one is likely to shout at each other. I did not understand why the family felt that their youngest could not deal with the news, but in the hard past it was quite impressive. <br /> <br />
