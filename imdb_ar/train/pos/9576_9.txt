One of the most naughty and brutal films I have ever seen, but also one of the most tragic movies and movement. This is a melodrama movement that the world has never seen before. Sometimes, the plot approached me to cry, while the next moment I revealed a shocking shock like a crushing blow to courage. Chilling performance of Chen Edison. The story of a Hong Kong policeman and a Cambodian killer catching each other, while losing his humanity little by little is a powerful story. "Dog bite dog" is characterized by a very small dialogue that depicts the haunting images and the distinctive camera works. The "bloodshed" of Hong Kong is purely heroic.
