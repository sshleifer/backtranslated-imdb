I did not read all the comments, but at least one sticker mentioned that the version may be shortened to 30 minutes. I am curious about it myself because the last parts of the film did not make sense to me even when I saw it. 30 minutes looks really short for a film in 1917 too. "Poor Little Rich Girl," which was the next 65-minute Tornor film and "The Pride of the Clan", was 84 minutes long. So I feel relieved because I was not crazy, there must be a part of this movie missing and for this reason the decision is not meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's hard to review or comment on a film you can only see half ... but I recommend this film anyway because of the truly amazing show from the East Coast film studios at the time. It is the oldest film I have ever seen personally based on the film industry itself. The main character is a film star by Robert Warwick, who was later a major Hollywood actor, and appeared in nearly all Preston Storges movies. He plays the role of a Western actor perhaps ambiguous style on William Hart, who is somewhat like Warwick. After the really wonderful sequences set in the studio, we see her in a shooting location where he discovers a rural girl (Doris Kenyon) and persuades her to come to New Jersey for a very bad screen test. After this point, the film appears to be missing key sections of our existing model. <br /> <br /> Once again, I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the film to get the value of the documentary, but in the form if it is not a film and is not a good example of Maurice Turner's work.
