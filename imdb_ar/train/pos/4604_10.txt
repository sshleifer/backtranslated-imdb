This film is undoubtedly perfect 10/10. For all the people there who classify this movie in low degrees because it does not have a "good plot" or anything like that, this is ridiculous, saying Jackie Chan's film is bad because of a conspiracy like Saying a pornographic film is bad because it has no plot! You see Jackie Chan for THE FIGHT Scenes, the work does not focus much on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how to make films and compare them with other American films from that era and until later you will realize that Jackie Chan films were the highest They were really good plots, while the American films had good plots, but the scenes of the movement were strange compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Pornography is monitored, and Jackie Chan watches the ACTION movie, I think people classify it as bad because there is no conspiracy because you think this is how an intelligent film critic can evaluate a good movie but the way I see it good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure, the middle of the film was boring, very boring, but put it this way, while the rest of all the action scenes and stunts are paid for it all. This changed the way in which the films of the American movement were created, but scenes from this film were stolen. If you want a real man, a real artist, then watch this movie and many new Jackie Chan movies, everything is fine. It literally makes American films look like a picnic in the garden, even in today's movies. American films rely heavily on special effects, safety wires, double play speed and much more. Police Story and many of Jackie Chan's other films are the works of a real-life artist who has just grown up and is very talented in what he can do. Masterpiece
