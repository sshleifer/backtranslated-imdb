Back in the 1940s, when films touched on things that were not yet accepted in the "polite" society, they resorted to blogs that are supposed to float on the heads of most of the audience and alert those who are aware of what happened. It is possible that no film of this decade has been shipped with a hint like the mysterious mysterious Mysterious Desert Fury, located in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. Inside the city is driven by a handful of her daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking, at Technicolor, for $ 20 million. But listen to their dialogue, suggesting that the older lesbian and her young young lady (one can only wonder if the original text of A.I. Bezzerides has clarified this relationship). The most obvious is John Hoodick as a bandit Wendell Currie as a madly torpedo torpedo. Add Bert Lancaster as the town's city, move it, and sit down. Both Lancaster and (amazing) Hodik fall to Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak has no past with Astor, but has a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms these ingredients until the boiling is solid, with many face plates and swag swings. Do not get up from this reptile-filled drama, or be flooded with strange, creepy flowers, if it's on your way; it's a wonderful movie.
