The first time I saw this, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only 15 years old and I thought that perhaps some of the deeper humor was so mature that I did not understand it at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw him for the second time a few months ago, this time, it was because Felix tried to abort at the beginning of the movie which darkened the film a bit. This scene made some of the things that Oscar said and done to Felix later in the film seemed unnecessarily harsh, and their personality clashes were not as amusing as they might have been. If I had not already known the story, I would have worried that some strange Oscar for Felix might have pushed him to the edge. As it was, he did not make me laugh or smile like the TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, it's all a good film and has produced one of the greatest comedy series on television. 7 of 10.
