John Travolta, the world's largest, mechanical bull ... what you can ask for more! Yes, you probably will not get many surprises or deep meaning in this. However, I have always found it interesting to watch this underdeveloped romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sisi (Debra Wenger) meet in my generation and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you might expect a couple behind your hardcore. Scenes of honkeytonk with fun dancing, mechanical bull riding, and of course the fights required. Contains a good rural soundtrack, 1980, showing "Searching for Love in All Wrong Places," "The Devil Goes to Georgia," and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break your cowboy boots and have a boogie boot - scootin '! <br /> <br /> *** (of 4)
