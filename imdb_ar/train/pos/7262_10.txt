My daughter and her friends have seen this film literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some young friends ran with it. Later, I've rented it many times. It just does not get old! Blockbuster is no longer on their lists and has been trying to buy, find and rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this movie was my most favorite film in my childhood ... it was everything! We laughed, we cried, we discussed the real life and how difficult some of the children in the world. There was nothing to claim about this film. We are related to every invoice every second! Thanks Million for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shilin and Kyle Vandermi. Craven, Saskatchewan. Canada, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> UPDATE August 2007: <br /> <br /> Who we judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who loves love chooses to raise a child other than his child. It may not be my life or your life. It's unbelievable only, it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate!!!!
