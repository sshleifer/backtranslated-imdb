I watched this film for the first time on a local station in a horror show that appeared on a Sunday afternoon around 1969 or 1970. Cut it. I was a little boy at the time, but I loved him and I did not really fear him. I thought she had a wonderful story and very innovative. Looking back, I'm still amazed that it was shown on the day on T.V. Uncoated in those years. I've searched for this film ever since, and I've seen it over and over, and I've always loved it. One might think that John Waters would have won the film. It should not only be a scary film, it is one of the most fragile and powerful films ever produced. Surprisingly, you do not hear about this film as having a cult that a film like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" has acquired over the years. He has the following cult, but should really become a classic cult, in my opinion. To my knowledge, this appeared a little before the appearance of Blood Feast, making this probably one of the first real "gore" movies. In fact, this film contains elements from Hershell Gordon Lewis and a bit of Russ Meyer that were well dumped. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who likes the lively, naive, white and black horror movies from the early 60's (I think the date at the end of that 1960's reading).
