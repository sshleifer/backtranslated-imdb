I have not seen Richard Thomas play a bad man. I was not sure I would like it this way. I was not sure he could pull it. But this stunned me. I sent shivers to my spine and caused me to take a closer look at the people on the streets. The film is vague and fast-paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he can really do is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's how real people will fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you should see him here at his best!
