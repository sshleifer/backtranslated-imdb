This is one of my favorite comics ever. Not wanting to condone the lifestyle of his uninspiring hero, but taking into account what he deserves and not as an alcoholic, the film is simply a lot of fun. He is always drunk, irresponsible 40, Arthur, who is supposed to inherit a huge fortune, but only if he marries Susan, who was chosen because the family thinks she might make something out of him . Arthur suggests, but then Linda is misplaced, a waitress and a small thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is an idealist like Arthur, the world's most beloved alcoholic, who laughs his strange instincts for a minute. Admittedly, I am Moore Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in this role. The women are depicted as well. Lisa Minelli starred as Linda, a brilliant chemist on the screen with Moore. Gill Claiburg plays Suzanne, the richest and most appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is made by Sir John Jungod, who depicts Arthur Butcher as sarcastic but moral, Hobson. It is clear that these two had a great reciprocal emotion during Hobson's long tenure. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and financier for comments and unwanted advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romantic relationship at all, but his unusual relationship with this witty server is of course a permanent rejection. It's the personal server that you will remember longer after the credits expire.
