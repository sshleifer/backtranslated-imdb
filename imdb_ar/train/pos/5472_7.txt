Barbara Stanwyck is a tough real cookie, a working class waitress (and a prostitute by her father) who runs into New York City and uses her female tricks to get a file-keeping job, move to mortgage and security, and then as assistant secretary of the second bank. She has not lost the dramatic study of a character who is not afraid to be invalid by any of her strength over the years, as Barbara acted with a storm (imagine a woman learning to be a first-rate actress). This unique lady, who used to ridicule the small philosophy of Nietzschean in her corrupt life, crushed feelings all right, but she never loses our magic, and our terror. It is a petition that is easy to pronounce and boiling, but it is not a prostitute, nor is it a man or a man who hates women. This galaxy is the same for it, and while we wait for it to finally recognize the true values ​​of life, its journey up and down the ladder of success provides a warm and exciting entertainment. John Wayne (thick black hair and great eye makeup) works well in an early role as an assistant in the file bureau, although all the supporting players are very good. *** from ****
