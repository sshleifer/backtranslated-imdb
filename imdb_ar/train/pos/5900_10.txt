I am very sorry that this charming and eccentric film (which I first saw shortly after its debut in the early 1950s) has had a poor reception lately. In my opinion, it has been largely underestimated - but perhaps more attractive to European humor than (for example) Americans: perhaps in Europe we can understand and appreciate its mysteries and attitudes more, because we are closer to some of them in real life! Special mention is made of limited but good music - especially the memorable, "It's a great and good night", which was released separately on the HMV 78rpm record (a 10-inch plum label, I think) in the 1950s. I would urge anyone interested to try it if you get a chance: you may be pleasantly surprised.
