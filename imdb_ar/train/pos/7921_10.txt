It's funny, see it !!! <br /> <br /> Well, they want 10 lines so there: a spoof of the Werewolf movies in the 1950s / 1970s. Too much spelling, some political. It looks like an early Clouseau (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with a less slap stick. If you like Naked Guns, you'll also be surprised (again less on this video). <br /> <br /> In fact, the humor ranges from the mild sexual connotation (unavoidable in a teen comedy) to a truly influential social-political satire. The transformation of a high school moon from 50s to 70s is really funny. Sequence with photo changing chair is gorgeous! Well maybe not wonderful but still hilarious. There are tons of cracks (historical) that begin from the paranoia of the 1950s and inflation in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!
