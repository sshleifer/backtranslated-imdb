Bill and Ted's false journey could be the most excellent film I have ever seen. Despite the representation, landscapes etc. poor, who cares. The story line is fantastic and jokes and their words are very excellent and the ideas are great as well. I would recommend anyone to see this classic. Obviously the best part is when you "roll" the death, I crack for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was fantastic as well. Probably the most extreme film of all time! I think the best part of the film is that when Bill and Ted shout out excellently and play the guitar solo, it was a joy. Rock On Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen Release Third Movie !!
