Let me mention at the outset that I have cerebral palsy and went to this film and I expect that it will allow me to offer a premium for outstanding performance. I left the theater and I am convinced that they were playing the role of a cerebral palsy representative in this role, although I knew it was not. The presentations were excellent in general, with a special reference to Brenda Fricker and to O'Connor (I think this is his name) is the young Christie Brown. Christy is gifted, explosive, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and vain - in other words, a human being. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and King Gimp documentaries, are excellent images of life with CP. By no means a complete picture, but wonderful examples of disabled people. strongly recommended.
