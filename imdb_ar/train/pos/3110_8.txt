The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy is somewhat lacking in the story section, but it is covered with wide movement scenes! It takes Twi in particular some of the show time and make this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was hard to find a story for the latter part, because the end of the second film was quite ... the story of advanced wisdom. How did they turn it? Scenes of motion, once, but they also did something else, which I can not reveal, because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll notice it! It is interesting to read that this amendment in Bourne's books is the least accurate among all three films .. if that means anything to you: o)
