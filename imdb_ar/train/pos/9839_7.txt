Hmmm, yes this episode is very disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of bad writing and representation in parts. I think good might win bad. <br /> <br /> I love the origami parts and the big "twisting" at the end. I absolutely love this scene when Michelle meets Tony. She is actually one of my favorite viewers in the first season. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people always hate cycles of reincarnation, but I've always loved them. They are not the best, in terms of writing. But the subject really interests me. <br /> <br /> I'll give him a three star, but if the writing is a bit more consistent, I'll give it four.
