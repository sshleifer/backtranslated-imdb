I consider myself a huge movie buff. I was sick on the couch and appeared in this movie. From start to finish, I watched in the horror of these great actors, I have never seen, say a wonderful word. The photography was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope you hear this message for any bad comments written by others. The manager has a heart and beats him with his representatives all the time. Thanku for making a film like this one. Just wonderful embarrassing characters, beautiful flawed and graceful at the same time. Cool. I can not make this without 10 lines, so I will continue to say I wish more of this director, and more of all the actors in this film and more of the writer. I did not want to end. End
