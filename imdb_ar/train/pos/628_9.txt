This movie is a lot of fun. Actors really make the film go away though. Without abandoning the plot, I would describe it as the cult of the new favorite Princess Pride that must stand the test of time. You get to see a completely different side to Robert De Niro in this movie! (Worth the admission price just for that!) All items are from adventurous to romantic, and the comedy is in good standing. <br /> <br /> All people of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents did!) Good special effects, may be scary for young people. History of a good film. Great for some escape. <br /> <br /> Worth a. (Hopefully it will be good at the box office)
