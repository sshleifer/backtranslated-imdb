Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an amusing parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular during the 1980s. Win Crawford plays the role of Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights the bad guys wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) running around the globe looking for some work (and some decent story lines). The couple meets with a young woman named Margaret (Karen Cobbins) who was abducted by a sister by a wicked white villain (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her brothers? <br /> <br /> A naïve and cheesy film does not pretend to be something that is not. I have to give this one a recommendation. This is if you enjoy movies that love fun and those who do not take everything in nominal value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
