This movie was awesome! I can not beat songs. I think I'm older than the music, but this movie deserves some credit here, guys! My favorite Jack was wild. I, being a lover of British actors, can not restrain all these young people. I did not know that when Jack was doing this, he was sixteen! He looks like he is eleven years old. It's short, that's what helps. Try posting your responses, colleagues, so that I can communicate with your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reid, this guy, Bill Sykes, I think the appearance of the drone is really familiar. Do you have any idea about the tournament before? If so, publish it, I really like to know.
