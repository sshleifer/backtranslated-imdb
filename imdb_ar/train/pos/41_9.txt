"who did that?" Contains many laughs and sure of fire. It is not only one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedy films produced by Colombia. Bernds originally wrote the script for Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke that ended in the profession, it was specifically designed for Columbia's comedy team, Schilling and Lane (released as "Pardon My Terror"). Very well for Stooges, and was finally filmed by Stooges at the end of 1947. <br /> <br /> Old Man Gudrich calls on investigators Hans Schump, Larry and Mo for fear that he will be killed. When they arrived at his home, Godrich disappeared, and his niece and various children tried to get rid of the officers. Will they find Godrich and bring the daughter of the foolish people to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after Christine McIntyre gave Mickey a wonderful; he gives the sound of his trademark (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre tries remarkably not to laugh! Other funny scenes: close-up of the spark of "Mo" looking for a camera lens; fighting in the dark with all the members of the cast concerned. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual characters filmed in Stooges. Through his curly hair, he could almost pass to Stooge, if he did not outdo anyone else! "who did that?" Is a jewel between Stooges Films with Shemp. Even curly die fans will enjoy this one! A real classic Stooge. 9 out of 10.
