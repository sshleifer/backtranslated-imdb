Yes, this gets ten full stars. Easy to be packing this genius. The universe was sent to Trent Harris a young man, strange and wonderful one day, and Harris caught him on the bar, in all this inappropriate glory that you can not falsify. It is very bad that it ended up a tragedy for the young man, if it was possible to write an alternative ending to that fellow's story. The other two stories in the trilogy tell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover playing the young men's roles respectively. The world is enlarged and strangely in context by re-novel, giving us a broader glimpse of the strange growth of vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!
