I saw it and liked it, Melissa plays her role well. Was in fact a ratification. My brother saw the law with my sister and I when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot she was based on a real story (I saw her a few years ago). I've just said that you think it's true & both my sister & you like it anyway I was wondering if anyone knew what homicide was or was like that was really involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love lifelong movies especially those real ones, or those that teach a good lesson. I thought I had seen something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where any help would be appreciated.
