In 2151, in Broken Bo, Oklahoma, a farmer shot Klingon Klang with a plasma gun after the methane shop exploded at his ranch, and Klingon was sent to Starfleet Hospital. Vulcan Suvall's ambassador proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the body of Klang to his warring empire on the planet Kronos with honor. However, Captain Jonathan Archer suggests going with the Foundation on its first trip and returning Klang to his planet planet. Jonathan invites naval lieutenant Hoshi Sato and Dr. Flux, who is treating Clang, to complete his crew, and was commissioned commander of Vulcan Sub-T'Pol to participate in the first serious task of Enterprise. When spacecraft equipment is closed, Klang is kidnapped by Sulibans after being shot in hospital. After the autopsy of Soliban's body that was killed in the shooting, Captain Archer was informed by Dr. Flux that the alien was in fact mutant, changed in the process of advanced genetic engineering. T'Pol modifies the Enterprise sensors to track the Suliban spacecraft until they reach the planet Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a watchman, bringing an important message about the Temporal Cold War from Suliban Sarin to the leaders of Klingons in Cronos. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a big fan of Star Trek, I did not follow the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable TV. I decided to buy a DVD box for the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first project, Captain Jonathan Archer, the wonderful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, and Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are an excellent trip, at least in this pilot program. I noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on a DVD it is only one part, so my evaluation is valid for both. I did not like the music score, which I found very disturbing, but this was an exception in this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Arch"
