De Palma's technique has achieved a high maturity by the time of this film, a superb display of his classical techniques. Unfortunately, as with many of the films by De Palma himself, the story serves more than the interests of offering an emotionally compelling story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson hears the shower while looking at her husband. Then she is caught and raped while his wife stands near the corner of the eye ?? - The whole thing is Angie's imagination because the husband is pumping away in her mindless bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead body of Harry Potter, who concludes with a joke that says "You'll tell Grandmother he's playing with Peter." She then goes to the treatment session, where she complains of her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Keane. He refuses, feels hurt and feeling ungracious and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then the Bravura series begins for about 22 minutes with no words, which may have been the highlight of the film. Among the many things that De Palma has acquired from Hitchcock is to understand the film as a purely visual means of storytelling? In the typical De Palma style, he becomes a way to show his immense skill. The problem for me is that in this case one begins to feel that the scenes are unnecessarily extended just to show the manager's skills. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. She sees strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, and then begins to turn on a man sitting next to her. De Palma subtly narrates a very complex account without any single word about Angie's attraction, her embarrassment, her retreat and finally finding the stranger and presenting him at the back of a taxi, all of which got a wonderful fertile degree from Pino Donaggio, who also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the series, Angie grew up with the man and wakes up to return to her husband. Once again, De Palma shows a lot of narration without talking in the dialogue. Angie realizes that she does not have her panties, that her husband is already at home, and he has undoubtedly had a venereal disease. , And they lost the engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. All this is very impressive, but one begins to feel some adversity because we are forced to do things like a long elevator ride from the seventh floor, then climb again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... spoilers from here on the exit! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. The woman breaks through until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a slow slow motion sequence where Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie reaches him, and carries the killer blade to cut Nancy's hand. Then follow some electric shots while Nancy looks and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. All good, by the time we had some dialogue again, as you think; "Woah, it was just 22 consecutive minutes of purely visual narrative!" Or maybe not, but I do. <br /> <br /> The role of the younger Dennis Franz plays a big role in the burgeoning detective role in New York, which everyone prefers to do for him. Michael meets Caen, which means obscene inclusion (though it is commonplace) that Angie wants to kill him. There is also Angie's son, who has been linked with Nancy, and they began spying on the Caen handler and knowing who the killer was. <br /> <br /> There is once again a strong link to Hitchcock's film, in this case Psycho (just as mania is the re-work of Vertigo). You have a woman who is supposed to understand it is secretly slut, kill in the first thirty minutes in a closed place, in which case the elevator is instead of bathing. Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man dressed as a woman to kill her. De Palma casts a doctor in the end explaining the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time, the viewer can start to feel some shiver, and this is my basic reservation about this movie. It is certainly a necessary presentation and presents some of the greatest elements of the De Palma group, but this feeling is that the story is in third place behind the need to display De Palma and that his sexual fantasies are somewhat inappropriate making it difficult to look at this full affection. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my website from Bad Movies and Cheese, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
