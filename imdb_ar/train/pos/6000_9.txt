Christine Watts (Molly Weeks) was broken, and lost her lover. She is unable to overcome her lost love in the past. She rents a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes with things to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the pain treatment is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point of admiration in "The Cure" is elegant cinematic photography that alternates between black and white. A brief and sharp scenario is capable of developing a tragic and grim love story with an unexpected plot in the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the sound is a bit high and is related to the fact that English is not my native language, and in some moments you need to repeat some of the words whispered by the narrator. The unknown leading actress has a wonderful and wonderful performance too. I hope I have the opportunity to see it again on the screen. Last but not least, the appearance of director and writer Ryan Jaffray can not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): Not available
