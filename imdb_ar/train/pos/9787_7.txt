This story acted beautifully. It is both sad and sad about a little girl's journey to discover where she came from and where to go. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident. Since being named the "miracle child," she has become dyslexic and finds life a bit difficult. Her findings along the way affect those closest to her. Her relationship with her guardian and her former boyfriend is dealt with carefully and sensitively, and all members of the support team are original, three-dimensional and believable. This hotel is located around a peach canning plant in a small town in Australia, a film that is thin and cozy and leaves you feeling good when you approach. After reading some other shallow comments about Hugo Weaving, I would add that I think he was cast brilliantly and was very exciting. No, he's not a housekeeper, but that does not mean he's unattractive.
