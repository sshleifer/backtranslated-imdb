This is the kind of film that is not made by the United States. That's why people rent foreign movies. It is a fascinating story of how one person, even if it is traumatized, can make a person find the cause of a free life. Everyone can learn from George. It also shows how people with mental intelligence in their lives suffer and appear to them in a very realistic way (I think). As a classic in foreign films, this film has a sweet and bitter ending, but it makes it a better film.
