First, let me say that I wanted to watch this movie for nearly a year because I knew that Angelina Jolie was in it and loved it. But my love has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. Anyway, there was no video store uploaded but low local library ha did. I saw him and loved him perfectly. Yes, there were stereotypes of Italian but they were good and funny. They were not insulting in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress has done a wonderful job. I laughed hard at sexual humor. In general, I think this movie is worth watching if you can find it. It's adorable and just fun to watch plain. I rarely classify films as 10, but I give them 10 !!! !!! <br /> <br /> Go and find her!
