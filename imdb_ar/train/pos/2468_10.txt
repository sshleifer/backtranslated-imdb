I went to see Hamlet because I was among the jobs. I thought that 4 hours would be wonderful. I was a fan of Prang; once again dead, Henry V felt absolutely stunned by the acting and filming of this film. Like other reviews it passes 4 hours quickly. Prana does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, born for this. When I watch this movie I try to find faults, I looked at the saliva and did not notice them. How managed to move the camera to and from the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was filmed in 70 ml. It is shameful that Colombia did not make a large copy of this on VHS. I own a DVD player and I would take Titanic on any day. If Colombia, if you are listening, put this movie the way you should see it! I do not know what happened at the Oscars. This must have captured the best picture, best actor, best output and best cinematography. What movies were they watching? I felt sorry for Pranach at the Oscars when he honored Shakespeare on the screen. They should have offered a tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
