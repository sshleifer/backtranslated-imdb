I am not saying that in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in the cinema when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins, it was magical, beautiful and frightening at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about him. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've seen this movie being broadcast several times but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it will bring back the feeling of magic and warmth in my heart. I liked this way. <br /> <br /> So I only watched this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to see it again. If you see that day, I know I can only criticize the behavior of MG, the plot (if there is one) and this and that. For me this is childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are the feelings of a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult self meddling in my assessment and giving it 8 wonderful memories and music. For this little kid who saw him in awe 20 years ago, this is definitely worth 10.
