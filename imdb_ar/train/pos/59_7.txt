While I was in the video store, I was browsing the rents of $ 1, and I came on this little gem. I do not know what was going on, but I had an instinctive idea about it, and my success was absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenager, the only witness to the full attack, and another is another survivor who survived a bullet in her head with some miracles. When they meet their fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving forward. <br /> <br /> I hate it when amazing movies fall in the cracks. Because wow what a performance by busy Philip and Erica Christensen not to mention the rest cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was pretty much lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the film were a bit of a controversy. But all in all is an excellent film.
