First of all, I think the comment below is not suitable for a site like this. Obviously you do not have a taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Not to make a historical lesson but I think it should be done. Black actors exist only, if not more, as successful as others. If you are not part of the "Black" race, you will not be able to understand the quality of old, creative and vibrant films like Sparkle, Mahogany, and Cooley High. Unfortunately, you are not black, it is not a pleasure to feel what we feel when we watch these classics, so keep your mouth shut and stick to your non-dancer. thanks.
