This amazing Academy Award-winning (4 in total) and first prize for the Oscar for John Ford, is simply amazingly stunning by Max Steiner. It was called a technical film, because Ford had little money to make this great story about guilt, punishment, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film classic, is the direction and stunning photography and the use of fog and lighting, which was quite different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. The Oscar-winning performance by Victor McLaglen as drunk as the Gobo is simply incredible. Basically, the film is shown in Ireland, and Gypo is transformed into a friend in the rebel movement into English to collect 20 lbs to deliver to his girlfriend. But after he got all the money, he started blowing it all night drunk and getting rid of it, while the movement's leaders tried to track the detective. The whole film is one night in dark and foggy Ireland, and a group of memorable characters but along, the whole world of Gypo approaches him, psychologically. If I had to pick three directors maybe to get all their movies on a deserted island forever, and no one, John Ford would definitely be one of them. What a really wonderful movie ...
