The Deathtrap of Ira Levin is one of those mysterious films in the Sleuth tradition that will be very easy to spoil due to any real examination of the film's plot. So, I will briefly say that it is about playing, and a man is the famous mysterious playwright, another man is a promising writer, the wife of the younger and sexist playwright of the role he should have been, and myself a German to ride. Director Sidney Lumette, no stranger to filming, is very good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs. The dialogue is fast, new and fun. Michael Kane excels in such roles. Christopher Reeve is fit for service and actually grows up to you whenever you see him acting. Erin Worth stands out as a funny psychic. What about Diane Cannon? I love how Lumet stuffed her ass in those real tight pants and wore her clothes and maybe the top is around her, but she is terribly misleading in this role - a role that should have been given to an older and less seductive actress. But why compromise with a clear attempt to bribe male viewers when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap funny, sophisticated, intelligent, and elegant. The puzzle contains some glaring flaws that somewhat detract, and I was not entirely satisfied with the end, but watching Caine and Reeve under the supervision of Lumet with the high Levine extension was enough to interest me and keep it throughout the film.
