It is called "One-Round" by Jack Sander, because he is a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they managed one round, they won a prize - a popular way to attract customers to long-haul travel offers. Jack loves the girl's ticket, Mabel, although her head quickly turns over when Bob Corby enters the ring to experience his chance with Jack. What nobody knows in the battle is that Bob is the hero, so he can overcome Jack - although it requires some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his partner in the fight and to abandon the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate angel. I hope, he's making his way in the rankings so he's almost ready to get the hero. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the hero and the mabel start running behind Jack's back - although Mabel has now married Jack. So, when the final battle between Jack and Bob occurs, they are very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is it good enough? Is justified anger rising against Bob helping or hindering his performance? Tune and see. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. While this type of film today seems strange to a well-known filmmaker in the 1920s, Hitchcock did not have any consistent genre, For this film). In fact, in many ways, this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, with a somewhat similar plot in one of his next silences, MANXMAN (also starring Carl Bresson as an unjust husband). So, although this is very much like a standard boxing film today, it was not a radical breakthrough for this great director - even with its fairly standard ending. <br /> <br /> In general, while it is a bit predictable after Ian Hunter played the role of a boxing hero that seems ridiculous, the film works well. Although it is far from total silence, it is worth watching and superb packages.
