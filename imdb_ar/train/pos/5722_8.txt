that was awesome. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the most terrifying film I've ever seen. It was not blood and courage, it was strange, atmospheric and terrifying. When I lent the stealth mom the bed in the Japanese version, I had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be wasted, and that Buffy would stay away from the scary nuances in the original. You do not need to worry. The makers of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people involved in the original film at hand, and gave the direction of the film to the same man. They also put it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director made a pain to reproduce the same film as originally, and the only difference was the selection of American actors. This actually turned into a benefit because he added the element "Strangers in Strange Land" to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by a terrifying and unrelenting specter, they were also stuck in a completely foreign land and the difficulty of integrating into society. I've just added to the general concern included in the film and thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> In fact, Buffy does very well. She looks weak and able to convey her fear well. There are no clever statements that are very common in American horror films, or one of the lines that detracts from public darkness and horror in the characters' attitude. In fact, it was as good as the Ring that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope that the future of American terror will follow closely the new wave of Japanese terror that began with the amazing success of Ringo. Finally, we get movies that can actually be classified as "horror" !! 10/08
