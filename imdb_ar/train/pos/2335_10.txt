That's what it should be. The daisies push up to those expectations. Pushing Daisies is a nice and well-designed display, one of the few remaining peak-time shows that is fair, family-friendly and inspires your imagination. It's not about normal work, sex, money or the corners of murder in every other show on TV. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real for all of us. The desire for something you can not own, in the hope that someone wants us, run away from your past and search for the family, even in the most likely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC has basically canceled this wonderful show in this Stage, and most likely will be replaced by a show beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything is due to money ... It's very bad that there are no other offers on ABC now that make you feel good after watching.
