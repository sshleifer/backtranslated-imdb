Buddy is an entertaining family movie set up at a time when "humanizing" the animals, making them a nice and acceptable way to make people interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows great love for the main characters of the animals and for others, and they will do anything to each other. <br /> <br /> Although it is not an ideal film, the animated gorilla is very similar to most of the time the chaos that occurs inside the house is usually entertaining for children. <br /> <br /> This movie misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals home as pets, but it shows difficulties. <br /> A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
