I think I really love this film. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but was later filmed in French in 1930. Although someone else's voice was named for her salary, this is still a stunning tour for Louis Brooks. The fact that her lyrical voice is called Legend Edith Piaf helps to calm us down from the proponents of deception. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story, first seen in a resort with her muscular boyfriend, Andre (George Charlia) and their friend Antonine (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a couple of legs: we see her inside the car turn into a bathing suit. Lulu is very free with showing off on her body and this does not sit well with the annoying Andr√©. When Lulu thinks of applying for the title of Miss Europe, we know that the happy end will not sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film focuses a lot on men who strike beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauty and the reactions of men staring at them. But in the middle of it all is Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from antiquity, think about checking out these movies. Louise Brooks is not a name that most ordinary movie buffs can easily know, but once you see it, you will be fascinated and you will want to learn more. Also check out the Pandora Box if you can find them. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the US Kino DVD version. I do not know if the display speed is correct. It seems that a lot of scenes appear very quickly. Maybe that was the way they fired. I do not know, I do not know. But since it is the only way to watch this movie, it is useful to swallow one simple pill.
