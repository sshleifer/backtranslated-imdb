She really avoided me when I referred to Drew Barrymore as if she had been beaten in the face with a skillet, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin that Jay Leno would have shot. How wonderful, then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really love Miss Barrymore; Jimmy Fallon and Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably the best comedy sweet and light. To be perfectly stereotypical, the girls will love the film because of its Roman charm and the weakness of Jimmy Fallon, and the boys will love them for all the male bonds and the portrayal of sports obsession. <br /> <br /> My sports fan is my wife, my teenage daughter, and I've found everything I love in the movie. To say something in itself. It's a delightful way to spend an hour and a half or so, and its history may be very good.
