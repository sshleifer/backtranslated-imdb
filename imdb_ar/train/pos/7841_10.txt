This is actually fun for all Bolan fans, some may think it's a little over, and it's only about the elegance of Ringo and Mark, but I think it's like any other video for the concert, except for the fact that this is Mark Bolan, not just any man! I liked the music video for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip alone is worth all the money, I can not believe they did not launch this version as an individual song. The film is really wonderful, especially for us. Now, I was not alive during the 1970s. But the Danes in general were completely shot at by what happened around them. The media did not play or displayed any of the popular music of the time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, but they played only a little with The Doors, but only really famous songs. Therefore, I know from my father that seeing this, restoring him as part of his youth, never experienced him. <br /> <br /> I will not go into this for a long time, so ... if you are a little less fan than Mark Bolan, you need to see this. You may find it boring or as mentioned before, just above the top. But at least I saw one of the best musicians ever, at work! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappoints me a bit is that Ride A White Swan is not on the bar. But I forgive her, because Jeepster and Get It On have played wonderfully.
