The film shocked me. Personally I had a bad buzz flock mostly. Well finally after owning a DVD for several months, you put it on a sleepless night. Although the film was withdrawn, the additional shots were used for his passion and his recovery from the addition to the game was less realistic if they left any scenes. The best thing about the film is its consistency with the relationship. No previous person has appeared or personalities threaten the relationship. I usually mean to see the girl meet the boy through some amazing fate, her history, and the thing we saw coming break them, then come back together in the last five minutes of the film. But this film did not follow this template. We have already experienced the relationship and its shortcomings, and although the characters had moments of opposite love, they did not have dramatic breaks where they burst and montage every 15 and then united in love again. I did not feel that the film was expected like the rest of the romantic films. The story was unique and truthful in the way I felt that these people in the film were the most faithful I saw in a romantic film of modern times. It did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were in the actual world chain so the little fate kicked there too. He is not "my beautiful lady" but he is a passionate and sincere film. I will simply say I like it.
