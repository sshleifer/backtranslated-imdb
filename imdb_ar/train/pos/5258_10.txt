The Ladies Man laughs loud and funny, with a fantastic variety plus very stupid but excellent scenes (including the most extreme love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is of his usual quality in a brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows is an amazingly good zombie and has written himself some of the nicest lines you'll find in any comedy there. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth buying as a watch every 6 months or so will result in you still laughing as hard as you did in the first round. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at the time of writing that this report contains a very small 4.7 / 10 rating and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> The children remember - "there is more movement in the ocean"
