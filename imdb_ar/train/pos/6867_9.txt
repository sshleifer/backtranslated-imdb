I was born in 1982. Most memories of my childhood in the late eighties and nineties. I first saw Groove Tube in 2001, when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> She found it fun. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks there is something "dated" he can be funny after 30 years .... Think again! It's funny, even if you had no idea what it was like in the 1970s, and the idea of ​​pants makes you swing. Who can argue with the type of Bozo clown who reads adult literature? There is a lot to laugh at. Showing the scrotum dolls in the end is the best.
