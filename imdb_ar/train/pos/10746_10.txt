I live in Missouri, so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me, and this is what brought them home. These two men were putting themselves at stake in the way the FDNY and NYPD members did, just to document the horror that appeared that day. This film is a testimony to those who lost their lives and the real evil that terrorism brings.
