Bruce Almighty, one of the best curry pictures since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the most extreme scenes I've seen in a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays well and even chips in some amazingly funny jokes. It contains romantic moments or a bit boring but on each film is wonderful with some funny scenes. The best scene in it, is the place where Jim's voice hangs the anchor man. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
