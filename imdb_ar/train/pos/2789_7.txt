Bend like Beckham is packed with interesting sights but has a stroy line generally predictable. She is about a girl named Jess trying to realize her long dream of becoming a famous football player and finally getting a chance when she is offered to a local team. There are a lot of borders and borders that face and hinder her back, but they are still designed and designed. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a nice light film and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The song's choices are really good, "Keep on my baby, go up ... to your destination and set limits and complications." Anyway hope that it was in help to your needs in the review. Bend it like Beckham's big flick
