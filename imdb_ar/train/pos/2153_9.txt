This film was enchanting. An accountant wants to live more than conventional success. What makes it work well, and makes it quite different from the standard dance movie is that it's not about getting "cool" but just about finding a way to express yourself. The big victory in the end is not winning a contest, not discovering a whole new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to achieve other parts of your life. No one discovers their passion, they find their quiet spirit. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes the hidden persecution and "secret life" of dancing both dance. We can all see ourselves in every man.
