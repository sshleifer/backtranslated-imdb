This film was shown in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this film, I do not think about this wonderful television series. I think this was the flick of horror in the early 40s, when he was a surprisingly good voice and sound for a 67-year-old horror film in the public domain. I really enjoyed watching Bella Lugosi and his strange team, including his wife, who needed fluid from the potential young puppet glands, an old incandescent, and her two strange sons, one giant stupid and the other a comic dwarf (Angelo Rosito) of 1932 Freaks). I also enjoyed the lovely young reporter, which is a stereotype, but I still enjoy watching it. My only problem in this decent film is that it's a conspiracy, even silly and unbelievable for a movie. I do not want to spoil any film from this film, so I'll take it out and rent it, or better, buy it for a few dollars.
