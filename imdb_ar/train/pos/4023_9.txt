This is a very good film. Representation, writing and camera work are all first class. Music is also good, although it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheerful. There are no great stars in the cast, although many faces will be familiar. The actors are doing an excellent job using the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to see, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims against each other and then brutally separating them into two countries. There are some advantages to this view, but it is also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did at the time of division. It seems likely that the British simply saw interfaith tensions and were smart enough to exploit them to achieve their own ends. <br /> <br /> The result is that there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in this situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But not painted as a black and white case. There is a foundation and nobility on both sides, as well as hope for change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There is a redemption of some kind, in the end, when Boro has to make a difficult choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also really loved her, and her family who disowned her, and then come later looking for her. But by this point, she has no choice without pain for her. <br /> <br /> This film conveys the message that Muslims and Hindus alike have grave mistakes, and that both can honor and care for people. The reality of partition makes this realization more acute, because there can be no real reconciliation across the Indo-Pakistan border. In this sense, it resembles "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we were happy to see the film, although the decision was horrifying. If the United Kingdom and the United States can deal with their history of racism with such candor, they will certainly be in a better position.
