"Hot Millions" is an exhilarating comedy that has been better prepared by having a wonderful crew assembled for it. The film is a tribute to the geniuses of Peter Ostinov, who wrote a screen play and appears to be the main character of an adventurer. The film, directed by Eric Till, does not show signs of its history as horribly as others of that period. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the event, a friendly man, Markus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, is repairing the income tax models on the manager, who is amazed by the amount owed to the government. Marcus, a genius in numbers, sees opportunities that others do not want. The company starts using the latest computer accounting, but Pendleton is a stunt man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different false accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Markus is appointed as a secretary, who also happens to have an apartment in the building. Patty is seen as an inefficient laborer working as a taxi fare bus who runs to mess everything up. Her failure to act as secretary is incomprehensible, but things are never in the office when the terrifying Willard Ganathol decides to follow her, but she has no fear. Patty's heart belongs to Marcos, a brilliant pianist and flute who make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Peter Ostinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should play and escape with the film. Mr. Ostinov gives a definitive account of embezzlement. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at its best with Patty, the good woman who loves Marcos and who proves to be a genius when it comes to investing money in the pockets of Marcus. <br /> <br /> Carl Malden is perfect as the US official for the company. Bob Newhart also appears as a genetopoul, the man who wishes to pate, but he can not make her reciprocate. Robert Morley is seen as a great Caesar Smith, whose identity is Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears in a wonderful role as a customs inspector at the airport. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will be all looking for a fun time with that repulsive character, Marcus Pendleton.
