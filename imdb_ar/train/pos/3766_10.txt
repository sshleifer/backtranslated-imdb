Creative visual epic in an unmatched style. <br /> <br /> This movie may not contain the most alternative drama or artistic representation. But who dares to say this film is not an art? I am not a proponent of the idea, that the important film must be serious or non-commercial or bother me with questions. So there are a lot of movies, which fit these qualities, which I love. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Bogus is not a trip, one of these films. What you get is an overly creative creativity with very positive child energy. This film does not reflect reality. Its naive friendly and utopian. Imagine a future scientist named Rufus - for me it would be a wonderful combination of time and place to live in! Except for that music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney was well made. I have always loved cinematography and the scenes of this film. Especially at this stage Bogus Journey is very bright. The effects are also good, I think most of them are made very without the use of CGI. I generally prefer the good old effects in the big budget movies. Make sure "just another Hollywood movie" from the point of view of some peoples. But I think this is a very attractive way. <br /> <br /> A short word to the soundtrack: All band music and orchestra fit with the film. Also the sound design has no shortage. I'm not a rock enthusiast, but I had to get this track by Winger from the "station" scene that builds the bill and follows the robots in the truck. I like the unconventional camera work at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very creative! It's a better way than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin or The Godfather or Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. It's quite superior to Ken Kane, the end of the world now or the marks of Chris No Sole ... ... It's better than Total Rikal ... no way !? Yes, <br /> <br /> Bill & Tides, Buggs Journey is simply the best movie ever created. <br /> <br /> Whoever dares to differ makes himself guilty of "art behaviors" or likes to end the terminator (what is the biggest self-libel) <br /> <br /> Note: Part 1 is not the best film. Even a fake lawyer is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! it's not!
