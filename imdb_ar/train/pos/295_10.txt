Bogdunovic classics (often) is not an exaggeration is a film quite different from any other film. The film feels like a fairy tale, but has a really strong foundation because of its use of original Manhattan sites and a "real" geography, and perhaps the best photography of sites in New York City I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with the good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be great, and that the whole group is a group you'll really want to be able to spend time with. One of the few romantic comics of the last twenty years that does not seem to turn into something else, this is the point of Bogdanovich's fertile career after "success", when his best works were really accomplished ("Saint Jacques", " Waiting for ... "," noise off ".
