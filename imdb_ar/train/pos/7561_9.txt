The version I saw from this film was a blockbuster lease with a similar title, but a word I swore at. <br /> <br /> This movie was as funny as hell. It was also true in bones. If you've spent time in Hollywood or the surrounding area, you'll understand the sense of humor. If not, you may not "get it" at all. <br /> <br /> Two people at work struggle to reach the finish point, a rare jewel. It is a drama, but it is a drama as far as Deer Hunter is considered a comedy. <br /> <br /> Lauren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supportive actress. Jimmy Kennedy was able to carry his well. His performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra but we could not get it all.
