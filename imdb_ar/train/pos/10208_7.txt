We rarely see such short comments written by filmgoers from IMDb. Maybe the reason for this dark comedy is light weight and pleasing without depth, or are we missing something? I was watching him again if I had some incentive. <br /> <br /> So, what is the coincidence? To the French is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" by chance? fate? This event may be the culmination of a series of random events. We have all gone through these things (called life), but when we look at them this way, you begin to feel that the word "random" may be like "destiny". <br /> <br /> There is a "coincidence" in this film may be a minor event such as hitting a few leaves from the back of the truck or as a large base based on a great life decision on the accuracy of the strange throwing stones. All these accidents cause other events that ... Well you get the picture? domino. Beat these letters with 30 characters and 6 characters each, and you should really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance of this scenario. I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. But this is the magical world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We recognize that it is interesting to see how the writer / director weaves these irrelevant events in a story that revives the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours looking for an eccentric escape, here is the place to do it. Or if you are recovering from the surgery and did not go anywhere anyway, it will involve you while healing your stitches. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not happen as a prize winner, but it should evolve significantly. Strange things happened. <br /> <br /> Surin Kerkegaard is attributed to: "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must live forward." If you look at the details in many of your own life experiences (interviewing your first love, finding the perfect gift, and your last car accident), you will find a series of random events that lead to it. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring with me my presence to explain "Happenstance" to me.
