I've got this movie about a month ago and I am now a fan of fanatics Lado Barrymore. I love the happy ending and this movie gives a wonderful story with the facts of the cracked Red Sox movie! It's about a math teacher who takes some promising children on a math trip to a company where the successful Lindsay (Drew) has some information. This then leads in Ben (the teacher) and the history of Lindsay. But it's not that easy when he admits to being a big fan of Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine but then hobbles his baseball life Lindsay. Everything was okay in the end and it took one shot to get Drew running across the field !! I got it for two years in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you see some of Drew's works like Charlie's Angels and 50 initial dates or even her new movie with Hugh Grant on behalf of Music and Lyrics.
