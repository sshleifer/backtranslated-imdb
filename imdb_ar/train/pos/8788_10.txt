Well, I'm happy to hear a rumor that this may eventually be released on a DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I will get it when it is released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most thrilling film, especially when "Gentleman Jim" Corbett's ring begins in the film. Then moves from a good movie to a great movie. <br /> <br /> Few people can play arrogant men and still be able to appear as a good-loved man as well as Flynn. This film is a perfect example. It is said, this was Flynn's favorite role and I think so. You can only figure out how much fun it has enjoyed here. Ward Bond also seems to be genuinely enjoying his role in playing John L. Sullivan famous. Bond was also never better. <br /> <br /> There is only an adequate amount of boxing action here and it is very good, too. The Corbett family is also interesting to watch, as they continue in the stands during Jim's matches. Outside the scene, the Corbett family's arguments can turn out to be screaming and loud and slightly annoying but pave the way for an appropriate conclusion. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the great battle is very moving and highlight the film. Some lively critics (Variety, for example) did not like that end or the fact that many of the films are fictional, but - duh - most of the films are fictional, like it or not. In this case, I made a beautiful story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a real gentleman talking, not anything like filming Cork, but Flynn still makes him a good man.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the most entertaining classic movies I've ever seen and I wait Reluctantly DVD.
