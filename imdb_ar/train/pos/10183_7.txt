Perhaps this is a charisma at its best, apart from Zubaida. Nana Patikar presents his best effort, even without trying. The story is very good at times, but the clouds seem to lengthen, especially when Shahrukh appears in the picture. What made me really impressed is the presentations of potential customers, and the presentation of the dialogue, as well as the story, of what they were. They could have been better forwarded, edited. The supporting case was wonderful, including a decent mother in law, although she was enjoying one bright moment, it was wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> The groups were also good. I do not really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but once they go to India, it's as real as it is. <br /> <br /> In general, I'll give him a thumbs up!
