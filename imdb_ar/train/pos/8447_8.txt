In fact, this is really not a "film", but a final episode. I mean, if you do not follow the TV series (Murder: Life on the Street), I think you will have a hard time following this specially made film. After saying this, "Murder: The Movie" is still a wonderful hour. I think he says a lot about television production that every member of the cast will return, after many years of absence, to film their characters again and close the amazing program. The film highlights this feeling of "family," not only among the characters, but also among the actors. All this is very bittersweet knowing that this will be the last time we will all see them again under the title HOMICIDE. A wise story, I found this film somewhat non-existent. Giardello's candidacy for mayor seems particularly contrived, and she felt that the shooting could have been dealt with within his usual status as a man's assistant. Also, Det. The Twist plot was finally solved by the extreme Bayleys plot, which was left hanging at the end of the series, but I never felt it was necessary; I enjoyed being ambiguous (let's remember that the first episode of the first episode was not solved too to run the entire string!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I can love this movie, and the fact that it was produced after H: LOTS was canceled, but I do not recommend it to anyone who has not had the slightest exposure to the series. Now, if they are to be released on a DVD ...
