I only saw the first series on the DVD, but I summed up the Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a text like Tarantino. This series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and as good as The Godfather (and therefore not "10"), much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there are a lot of actions, some fairly bloody, but the story is driven by characters. Even some small characters contribute to the lines of a wonderful story. Such as the relationship of the priest (or lack thereof) with Carmela and the wife of the owner of the restaurant, Christopher and his friend Dim (who did not last very long (a Darwin Award nominee?)) <br /> <br /> Regardless of the plot, text and representation, and other reasons I liked ; <br /> <br /> 1. Made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. This shows that anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
