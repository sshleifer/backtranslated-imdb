The Secret of Kells is an independent feature of animation that gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding Kells, a liturgical manuscript of the Middle Ages that incorporates the four gospels of the New Testament. I did not know that this book already exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier. There are few stories and ideas that revolve around how the book came, who wrote it, and how it survived more than 1,000 years ago. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We have met Brendan, the orphan who lives in Ireland's Abbey of Keles with his uncle, Abbott Silach (expressed by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is building a huge wall around the monastery to protect villagers and monks. Brendan is not fond of the wall nor the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something that Abbot Cellach no longer has time to do. He fears the "northerners," those who loot towns and villages and leave them empty and burning on the ground. <br /> <br /> One day the traveler comes from Iona Island near Scotland. It is Brother Aidan, a very wise man with a special book that is not over yet. Abbott Selach gives him a permit to stay, Brendan collaborates with him. Idan has special plans for Brendan. First he needs ink for the book, but he needs a specific straw. The only way to get it is to venture outside the walls and into the woods, an area beyond the Brendan border. Seeing that it is the only chance for Edan to continue his work, decides to sneak back and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest, Brendan meets Ashley, a forest protector. She allows Brendan to pass into the berries and along the way becomes closer to his company. It warns him of the danger that looms in the dark and does not frustrate him. There are worse things than the Vikings there. From there Brendan faced more challenges with the book and the certainty of invasion. <br /> <br /> I like the story much more now that I know what's going on around it. Find out now what a book of Kells and what it contains, perfect logical animation. I'm sure you've seen pictures or copies of old texts hundreds of years ago, with exposed borders, colorful images, expensive patterns, creatures and writings decorating the pages. Much like the opening frames of the Disney Sword in stone. The animation here contains many similar designs and styles. It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and animation attempt to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not overlook the amazing details. This is some of the best 2D animation I've seen in years. It is vibrant, motivating, and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by designs, doodles, patterns in trees, walls and the air around them. It enhances the film. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the end may be over. During a 75-minute run, I think there could have been something special in the last chapter. Does not give much information and does not hint at the importance of the book. We are reminded of its importance but do not fully understand it. We have been told that it gives hope, but it does not happen or how. This was the only part that lacked the film. Otherwise I thought the story was interesting although the animation surpassed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> I think this is somewhat acceptable. Animation can carry a film away before it disappears. The story lacks a few parts, but it is an interesting story about a wonderful history. I would recommend briefly searching for Kells's book just to get an idea of ​​what this movie is talking about. I think it will help your viewing experience much more. This very impressive and beautifully illustrated film should not be missed for sure.
