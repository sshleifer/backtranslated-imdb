I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought it would be his masterpiece - his victory. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the film seriously (as Mr. Wood did) it is already one of the worst movies you have not seen. This is fantastic. The big joke of "I woke up early, the day she died" is that he does not even try to be a good film. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very good. The scenario is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zein is absolutely excellent. As you can see, this is either sophisticated art ... or low trash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
