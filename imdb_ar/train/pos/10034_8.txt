I had a few problems with this film, and I heard a lot of criticism saying it was long and overpriced. True, it has been more than three hours, but I am surprised that it is going very fast. I do not think it's overpriced at all and I think the IMDb rating is quite decent. The film looks luxurious, with great costumes and excellent effects, and rarely steals the direction of James Cameron's focus. Leonardo DiCaprio offers one of his best performances like Jack, Kate and Winslet as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a wonderful actor, steals every scene he is in. The story is rich in detail, and is heated in personal evolution, with a clear love story that moves very when it is needed, although in the first part the film is a bit slow. The last hour is full of holes, and I'll admit I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very impressive. James Horner's musical score was fantastic, although I was not a fan of My Heart will Go On. The 1996 series were good, but they suffered from underdeveloped scenarios and some historical errors. Overall, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
