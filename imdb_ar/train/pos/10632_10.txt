This is a movie for entertainment. I did not think the world made a social comment from a single small film. Personally, I find this film funny, bold and unforgettable. It is a fantasy no different from becoming a beautiful girl princess. This film was added very well in the 1970s, where it was one of the best experiences in the film with reference to a person's sexuality. This film does not revolve around the fact that a person is homosexual or not, it is about love in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the facts that you were gay in the 1970s in Hollywood or California. The beautiful boys are taken care of by older people and not very beautiful men. Women who have been forced to remain in deep confinement in the emotional wardrobe or risk not practicing a profession. Bathrooms were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the imagination begins !! Let's confuse a lesbian with anomalous and add some liquor and what do we have? Well, this movie, which was better than this depressing "Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the whole crew to watch this movie then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the seventies and still brings a smile to my lips now. Warmly recommend anyone who wants a funny film and enjoy wrapping up some popcorn and enjoying some fun. Some people need to lighten up !!! This is the movie you must play! <br /> <br />
