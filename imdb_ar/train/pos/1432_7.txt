I was really looking forward to seeing this film because it was announced as a movie to watch for people who love movies about nature. The film presents different climates and associated animals by starting the Arctic and going down south with the film progressing. The footage of this film is often amazingly beautiful, and she has wondered several times about how they would catch some shots underwater or in the sky. However, it has been a large part of the footage I have already seen in the television series "Planet Earth," narrated by David Attenborough. Ateneboro's story of the planet was much better than the novel of the earth. "Earth" is the easiest film. It goes far beyond the scientific details that Ateneboro covers in the Earth series. For example, Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is the perfect nursery for the little humpback whale, because there are few predatory animals. Planet Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is a good nursery, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. This in addition to the superior voice of Atanburo makes Planet Earth a better documentary film than the Earth. However, I think the Earth is worth watching for beautiful footage and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.
