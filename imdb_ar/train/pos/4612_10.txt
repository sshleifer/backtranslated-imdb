Fred Guin, Louis, Syed Caesar, and Yvonne de Carlo play this funny and funny film. The late Fred Gwyn is really wonderful like Herman Munster, who lives with Grandfather Munster (Lewis), his wife Laila (Yvonne de Carlo) and his son and daughter. Mr. Caesar is a hilarious owner of the Wax Museum, which has a full section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax characters start to Hermann found in the city's terror blames everyone Monday. The two must now clear their names before it is too late. You will laugh out loud just as you did.
