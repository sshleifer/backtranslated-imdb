Drop the funniest parody of the buzz house movies that have been produced at all. <br /> <br /> This denunciation reveals all cliches, and then some! The actors are very bad (Downes syndrome!). A terrible self-important dialogue. The scenes that are supposed to shock but fall. Jarring Editing. Pointless plot points. It ended with a kind of narrow tale of disrespect for the public and vague psychological motives. <br /> <br /> It accomplishes exactly what was designed. A hilarious satire of those boring films by financiers of pampered teens, to show to their parents when they ask them what they have been doing for the past two years! After "What's this?" He was awarded the Cannes Prize, and it was reported that program presenter Werner Herzog was told that the film was actually a parody, in part of his films! It is supposed to dawn in the information. To this day, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I see and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.
