I thought this movie was very fun. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. So I did not see it as just family entertainment and I still enjoy it completely. Many reviews seem to indicate that this film does not break the ground, there were no unexpected changes in the plot and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people watch this movie and expect to have a religious experience while doing so, they will obviously be disappointed. This is simply an animated film. nothing else. If you want to watch this movie just to sit and allow yourself to entertain, you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, this is definitely not the best Disney film, but it's fun and I do not understand the bad reputation it received.
