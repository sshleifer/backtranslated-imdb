I started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes your attention is the refreshing coordination, which, although similar to many other real programs in essence, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is as wonderful as the host and chief judge of the show as well. The coup d'Ã©tat with the smart people who look good and are chosen as contestants is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of nonsense in his time, but his handling of cinema was excellent because he made New York City look like a character in itself. The jazz tones associated with some of the wonderful work of the camera on New York make a great look. <br /> <br /> The trainee will always present the best 3 realistic programs at all times (The Amazing Race is number 1). But just like the stunning race, this show is always seen in a moderate way. If you continue watching it for a while, the display originality will fade quickly (same as with TAR). Star World, the country's broadcasters, did a great job of making the show. The first three seasons were shown respectively, and two years later the following two seasons were shown, which kept the concept new. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first and second seasons. However, if you keep watching the show, its magic will quickly disappear.
