I saw this movie in 1984, we first started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to sleep. So we went instead to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory going on in your head, you'll need to see this theory. <br /> <br /> The question you should ask yourself when watching this movie is: Do you think the government will be able to do this? (In my opinion, no doubt they can) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information because that would be a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie yourself. <br /> <br /> But just to let you know, we're still talking about this film 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world.
