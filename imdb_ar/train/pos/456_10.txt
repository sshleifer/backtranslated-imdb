It is a beautiful film that recovers the soul. From using the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s and until inspiring inspiration, every choice was perfectly appropriate! The quiet joy of this film does not subside after seeing it repeated. It seems that Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Paulie Walker and Joan Blright were born to play these parts! I very much like to see Enchanted April released on DVD in widescreen format.
