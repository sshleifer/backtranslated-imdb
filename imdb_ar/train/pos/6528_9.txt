I watched this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely in this movie. I love a mix of fantastically fantastic scenes. It is an amazing design set. The scenes really look like they were photographed in 1920 or 1930. <br /> <br /> The music is very nice. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * The spoilers forward * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about the wonderful blues men, with black and white scenes of a black man playing guitar and singing. It's really amazing. But this is also mixed up in new bands, and maybe this is something I might not like in this documentary. It's a very good use of links with modern rock bands playing these blues in a modern way. I really did not appreciate their favorite way of playing these brilliant Blues songs. This is the same kind of non-ideal musical taste that I found when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was very welcome in this premiere in Small Cinema, which is the next day. This documentary was screened for all and ordinary tourists on Croisette Beach in the open air cinema. Although the sand, but the quality of the projection and poor sound quality made it difficult to enjoy the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.
