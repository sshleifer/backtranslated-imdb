This film begins with a family that were all moving in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha Masiasak (Olivia Dan) was in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). The mother was played by Metzi Kapture, (Jill Den) who suddenly enters her daughter and Zack makes out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface. A generation without a husband always travels or moves away from home a lot. There are also major problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip that does not hate her daughter Olivia and can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to keep all insects away. In many ways, Olivia performs brilliantly in adolescence and gives Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) a wonderful supportive role as the owner of the hotel. This film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of horror and horror. Enjoy
