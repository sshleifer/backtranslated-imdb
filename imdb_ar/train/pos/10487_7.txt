Grace Saving is a movie that feels good with its heart in the right place. Grace is a widow recently and realizes that her late husband left her with a lot of debt. She may lose her beautiful home and see no other solution to her misery except to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers like to live, all of whom are villagers who love most viewers as neighbors. There is only one mistake in this picture which is the way in which the effect of marijuana is depicted on the user. It is clear that none of the actors or authors of this film actually smoked. The way villagers behave after smoking a joint is ridiculous and supposed to be just funny. In those particular scenes, the wit is replaced by an English punk, which is unfortunate in a film no less fun.
