I've seen the perfect son about three times. I've failed to see how this film is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a gay film, I can not see why every gay film should have a gay film. I find that film sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone close to you. I think Theo changes his life fairly quickly after rehabilitation because he wants to watch his brother die in front of him, which makes him re-evaluate his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when he told Theo Ryan that he would be a moving father. Ryan says he does not want to know what he will never see or share. Is not this terrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
