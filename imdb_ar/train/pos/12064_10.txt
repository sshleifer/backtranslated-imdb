"The Woman in Black" is one of the coolest British ghost stories ever. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to deal with the ownership of a dead client, is chased by a mysterious woman in black clothes. The film is loaded in a very strange atmosphere and calculates fear and offers maximum impact possible. This keeps the viewer deeply engaged and the end is very disturbing. Representation acts excellently and tension is almost unbearable at times. So, if you want to see a scary horror film that really gives this look a look. I dare watch "The Woman in Black" solo at night with the lights out. Highly recommended 10 out of 10.
