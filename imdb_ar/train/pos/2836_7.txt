Bottom line: Zandali is a young woman who feels increasingly besieged in her marriage to Thierry. Terry himself struggled with the death of his father the previous year and lost his way. He immersed himself in the work, writing his writings, and Zandali lacks a hopelessly gravitational pull between them. In this Johnny enters, and an old friend of Tiri who was once an artists in exile together. But Johnny continued to paint, and he has a daily job just for rent. He takes the day as he comes and leaves tomorrow to his fate. There is an instant attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into an affair. But Zandli struggles with her lust to be desirable and her conscience and love for her husband. But neither of them, nor Zandali, nor Johnny nor Thierry can turn off their relations to get out of control altogether. <br /> <br /> Comments: Set as excitement. But perhaps more exciting than the heart is more than a natural excitement where it comes to life and death, the threat of violence. Heart-raising can not be deadly dimensions, but the threat comes from a different angle. It did not happen until the second half in Zandali until the excitement appeared, and although he laid the foundation for him in the first half, I really can not describe this kind of excitement afterwards. Much more romantic drama than anything else, but with the currents behind other species. Developing excitement exists, but it also contains more than a little erotic stunts. Because that is all, what drives the characters and thus the whole story. desire. Need for it, the need for it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's very good, and certainly much better than the current rating (4.1) anyway. It takes time but it grows a good sense of suspense, and deals with the very interesting part and taste. It's always an integral part of the story, I have to be there to give the story a wanted weight, and I never felt it was an excuse to show my breasts or anything like that. Unfortunately, the story's peak is long before the end, and the end itself feels flat, even if by its very nature. <br /> <br /> The impressive is impressive and is led by well-known actors such as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show was almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. She is very beautiful and very skilled at sometimes expressing the desire for desire, and she sometimes excels in both Cage and Reinhold in an external robot and becomes a little tough. Her career is then too weak for the talent she shows in Zandali, I can only hope that this is because of her own choices. Two personal favorites are also featured in small roles that give some extra edge to the film, Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you are in a good mood, this is a very good movie, you use another end to get the credit you really deserve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
