It is a less moving film. Jack, who is thinner, walks through hallucinations, visits dead friends, throws himself out of a building, and can not tell reality about hallucinations often. Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really reasonable. Confused, fearful but inert, and sometimes accepting what he sees explicitly, we try to sort out what he sees and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> A talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bath and bedroom offer no explanation as to how they get there (more hallucinations) and you have a surprising and amazing feeling, within 43 minutes, To restore any DOM fan again.
