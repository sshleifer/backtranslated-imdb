This has been one of my favorite films for a long time. Recently, I was happy to see it on DVD and it is a pleasure to watch the old versions of VHS. <br /> <br /> I have not seen him in years and watched him today to find myself amazed at how far the film stands until time. It is one of those rare and exciting storms of comedy where the great writing (really funny line after a really funny line) is associated with wonderful guidance and wonderful shows at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore won the Oscar for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gilgod won the Best Supporting Actor award). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win the Best Actor Oscar, it is evidence that no comedian can win the title (another example is Jane Wilder in Young Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon makes the movie beautifully while maintaining both character fulfillment and warm heart tone. Quite simply, IMHO movie is a rare gem. It is only sad that Steve Gordon died just one year after Arthur's release. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD available from 1/2007, it is. Although video quality represents a leap over older VHS copies, there is still a wide version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some nice additions but is not enough. One example of this is a comment by the director explaining his wishes to a large extent how to include some deleted scenes and scenes (because they were hysterical), but he had to make difficult choices to make a final adjustment. Since DVD is the ideal format for embedding such material, it certainly should have been presented as well. <br /> <br /> This, "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one of the books.
