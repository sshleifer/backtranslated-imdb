Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace," the allegations and counter-claims about how Episode II and III will highlight the "original" Star Wars movies have made them part of a coherent whole, rather than separating old and new movies To a separate trilogy. What the new films have done is to allow new perspectives to be put into old films. This new outlook gives us a greater appreciation of what was often seen as the weakest in the original trilogy: "The Return of the Jedi." ROTJ is often overcharged because of its overly "gentle" factor, it has the same power as the original and is less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back." In fact, the "gentle" element in ROTJ, ie Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire chain. Did George Lucas put the furry pygmies in the film purely for the promotion potential? Only he can answer this question. <br /> <br /> This gentle factor aside, the movie is a fascinating whole circle and epic evolution. After the film The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker followed his friends from Rebel Alliance to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirates who became the Rebel hero captured by Jabba the Hutt due to late debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker is a man who has been changed since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to fight the evil empire. After everything was black, Locke's discovery of his origins left him in a trance. His psychological makeup is not as strong as his outward appearance suggests. Although he may always aim to help his rebellious friends, he longs for another chance to confront Darth Vader once again, though he is not sure whether he will destroy him or eventually move to the dark side and join Vader on the Emperor's side. The early scenes in the impressive development, from the cache of Guba, to his floating palace and the "Great Sarac" - a rough thread living in the sand. Lucas's CGI improvements to the film in 1997 increased Sarlac's overall impact, making it appear fake and beyond. <br /> <br /> The battle scene in Tatooine is wonderful, and one of the most memorable events is a long story. Luke performs Jaba almost individually, proving that his power as a kid is almost complete now. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the patient Yoda again, the Yoda viewer is soothed by a clear lack of screentime. There is no doubt that the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", Yoda was cleared from the story where the progress of Luke's fate is displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is a really Luke movie, probably the most original one. His journey carries the film as he approaches his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. Other rebel figures certainly work in his shadow. The romance between Leah (Carrie Fisher) and Solo does not exist, unlike the "Empire". In fact, Lea's personality was developed only in ROTJ, and the solo character seems to fade away as aspects of his personality become very familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are attached to working alongside the rebels to destroy the new Death Star, which is nearing completion. This time the emperor himself oversees the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the emperor himself plans to bring the powerful Skywalker now to his side to work side by side (or does this replace) Darth Vader. The emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less subtle than the ruling left (Peter Cushing) of the film "Star Wars", which is psychologically darker than any other. The game of the Emperor Ian MacDarmid brilliantly, he is just one of those characters that you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are entrenched in their roles. Hamil surprised with the wiser Luke, making his character progress from a silent teenager, and a student ran out of patience into an enlightened warrior and one of the few personal developments in the series. Ford's role is magnificently magnified by the fact that his fascination and charisma spent the first two films - he was the real star of the first film ever. Fisher's Leia is more than just support, at least at the end of the film where you learn things about herself she was not sure about ... Add to favorites like Alec Guiness like Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2D2, Representatives. <br /> <br /> Despite the battle of the narrow film forests of the Ewoks and the Empire, they end well and include a triple battle series: on the Endor, in space and on the Star of Death, with all very impressive special effects. Music, as always, is fascinating and captures the mood in each case. Just as "Blue Danube" did well with "2001: A Space Odyssey", John Williams is part of the "Star Wars", like light swords and power. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the open end for interpretation, meaning that there could have been more episodes. In fact, science fiction fans invented their own versions of Episodes 7, 8, and 9 in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when granted a chance, and the pleasant animals leave a happy end to the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes are shown together, this epic can be the best. Is it already? Adding the I loop changed the scene from this series. That is why he can now watch the "return of the Jedi" in a different light and give a completely new rating after about 20 years of its release.
