This was by far one of the most beautiful images I've seen on screen. Andy Goldsworth is a kind of men at extinction. Earth and nature are viewed with admiration and respect to the degree that they are primitive. He breathes his purity, honesty and kindness as you watch him working in such simple and lively pieces of art. I was amazed at how patiently he designed his piece and patiently accepted its end. Sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointment with brilliance. The film is elegantly filmed and contains the same flow as the Goldsworthy Art. It combines nature and art in the minimalist as it is in itself. A unique FRET grade is organic enough to blend everything together without interfering with natural sound. This is generally a large piece of work on each side. It has no limits as far as age goes.
