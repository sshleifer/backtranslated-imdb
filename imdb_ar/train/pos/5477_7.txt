An uncensored original of this stunning film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress and was shown in a number of theaters around the world in 2005. According to the current reviews I found on the Internet, the original contains all the worst dialogue and hints Intact; subsequently removed or re-photographed entirely by the studio prior to the initial release, in order to pass the New York State censorship. I've also read that the DVD is "Expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we are really lucky, this will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the controlled version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck rules!
