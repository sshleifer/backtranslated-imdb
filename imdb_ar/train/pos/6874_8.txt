A series of short essays, most of them televised in the 1970s, but also with some excavations in government and American companies. One of the longest sectors, "The Dealers" is not funny to me and I do not know what parody. Some others, though, split the side altogether. I especially enjoy the cooking show slice. Most of the obscene words I know are used in the film, and if I object to nudity in front of me completely, move away.
