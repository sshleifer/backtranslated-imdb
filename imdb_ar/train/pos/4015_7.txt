Johnnie Johnny is one of the most satisfied western sponsors, with many WAI products manufactured during this peak period, and is highly recommended for fans of this genre or anomalous smart cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is, in most respects, not terribly authentic, but this actually does count on him. The success of a feature film depends on the extent to which it meets the expectations of the audience and provides a surprising diversity in these expected elements. Earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with a hidden (or main) evolution that provides constant attention. Obviously the quality of implementation is important. Tired renovation will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Because of these criteria, John Yuma succeeds. There are many elements from previous movies. The setting is the semi-twisted wild twilight world in which many of the best Western "Gothic families" created in 1964-68 are involved, such as the Tempo de Massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the Ringo films, a fact not surprising, with screenwriter Vendendo de Liu both involved. De Liu was one of the best script writers in the popular cinema that came out of Senecita in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work has helped to provide a lot of thematic continuity and consistency to this genre (along with other characters in several distinct circles of actors, Scenario). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in the town, creating a tense situation and then goes through a near fatal period followed by resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968) is literally a crucifix). The Catholic pledge of narrative and symbolism is interesting, especially in view of the popular / explicit socialist tendencies of the directors and their films. The Ringo plot, fully developed by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Giuliano Gemma, the selfish protagonist, chooses the interest of the community in his favor through the intermediary of a relationship with a member of this community (with the irony of DASH Health Uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Cardin and Johnny is clearly based on the relationship between Manko / Mortimer and the Dollar (1965). The two scenes for the exchange of belts provide an intelligent dialogue and an understanding between the two. Many films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, qui√©n sabe? (1967), used this relationship between an older and younger man (father / son, older brother / younger, Anglo Chancellor / adversaries and peasant revolutionaries) as the central dynamic of this conspiracy. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a focus on deception, misdirection, mazes and mirrors, which are repeated throughout the best WAI early programs. The Canaries and Poipulus Almeria become crafty mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play changing games for cats and mice. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Day from the other WAI is the quality of Romolo Gerieri's use of visual / psychological space together arrangement with intelligent script mechanisms to redirect the plot. The dialogue was never important to the WAI and was often absurdly absurd (he thought there were exceptions, such as the sarcastic comments in Django (1966) or Faccia a fccia (1967). <br /> <br /> The psychological depth of personality is fully established Almost by iconic images, they are differences, and a description of the overall narrative situation. See how far Samantha, the murderer, had seen the spectacle of beatings from the ceiling or the background of the movement, or how Jonny Samantha and Pedro slapped their safety and confidence in their strength through their terrible invasions at their ranch The hotel and even the bedroom (this, again, is the theme of the FOD.) Finally, note how there is a focus on searching for a For many information, this was borrowed from the FOD, which was ultimately based on the novel Red Harvest Mystery Mystery, through casual contacts, required posters, conversations that were listened to, external views of the windows, and the remaining clocks in the dus t , Or made a mistake in identifying identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the novel imagines to its end. <br /> <br /> The film was remarkable in time for what was seen as excesses of violence. Of course, these films were barely more violent than many Western Americans. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the reasons attributed to it, in the sense that it was not violent, but had changed. Johnny is a special and fun day to use and portray violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it brings to the unknown, nameless audiences in Italy and Spain, who have had these repetitive stories of some importance and usefulness. The piece may not have an intrinsic effect in itself ?? Some rocks from the prehistoric site, or crust of crusader pottery, or a piece of leather made of metal and rust ?? But it refers to some unknown existence, and spirits, which were important just because of its existence. Although John Yuma has intrinsic value, much of my attention derives from this connection and ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Western pasta list Top http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list ?
