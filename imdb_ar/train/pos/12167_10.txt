What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they stop working? How alone can one man get? When the worldly folly that we have to do to become part of society becomes too much, what happens? Fronland explores these questions. Surely the amazing original debut of Bronstein. Strange tone and fear of fear as we get into the mind of a man named Keith who messed up so he could barely form the proper sentence. We follow him while trying to contact people and work daily. Most of us have known people like this - people who say "sorry" a lot or "appreciate it" when there is nothing we appreciate. So we know there are people like this but why would someone want to make a film about them? Well, because her role is interesting and Brunstein and the lead actor, Man's Role, are doing an excellent job. This film is about un-commercial as it can be obtained. A few friends filmed it over a few years while they were saving money. Filmed on 16 mm, the appearance of the scratched film is budgetingly low budget. With no distributor, it may be difficult to find it, I think it has been randomly displayed over the past year or so. Hope to have a DVD at some point. I saw him in the silent movie theater here in Los Angeles. There were 10 people in attendance, including Crispin Glover, if this tells you how strange this film is. Highly recommended.
