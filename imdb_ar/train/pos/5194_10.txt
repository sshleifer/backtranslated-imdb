This is one of my favorite martial arts films from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's first films and one of the few conventional combat films he produced. You can see his effects from working under Zhang Chih in this film. Good work, the martial dance design is performed by Fong Hak On, which appears as one of the villains in the film. She is the star of Wei Pei's "Five Venoms" and a whole host of familiar faces for Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers fans. The story line is interesting, there are a few decent plot transitions and the accumulation of characters and their relationships with each other are intelligently made. This film was the only VHS version in the UK. Media Asia has released Region 3 DVD and there are versions of it on DVD available from the United States. The film is nice to watch in either its original language or in its English dubbed version. I highly recommend this film.
