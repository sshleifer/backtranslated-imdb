I am not a parent, nor am I a male. But I was able to recognize the pain and pain of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teens should watch. Maybe this way they will start estimating the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role from Bobby Ewing. It's great to see 19-year-old Ben Affleck offer his best in moving and honest performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heart drama. More serious roles must be presented. Hollywood Land ... noticed his first serious role in years and went out and won the Best Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be appreciated by people of all ages. Children under the age of 10 probably should not see them because they may fear the same thing for their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on a DVD and watched it with friends several times. It portrays important values ​​in life.
