This is the only movie to see if you want to get married or are you married. The film depicts a couple in Italy and deals with difficult topics such as abortion, infidelity and family work. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" we are witnessing these days in the world is terrible and this film will definitely make you think. <br /> <br /> You should see. I hope it will be properly distributed. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the actor and director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and a 10-star rating from me!
