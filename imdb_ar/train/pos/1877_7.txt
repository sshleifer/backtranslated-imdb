Arthur Bach was not happy with his life as a millionaire and attractive to people "without him" in social status - he pays the price of a prostitute in the opening scenes and then deeply attracted to a shopper. <br /> <br /> He drinks too much, and sometimes drives his car while drinking, too, which is never funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is wonderful but behind the comedy is some reality as well. John Gilgod sweeps the ground with anyone else on the screen and creates a character for ages. Talking about Oscar deserves. Moore and Minelli have their moments, but in Gilgod as "Hobson" you will remember more.
