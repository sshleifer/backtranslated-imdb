I hired this film because of my interest in American history, especially the somewhat strange Mormon story. This film tries to understand a little about how Joseph Smith can turn his "vision" into a major world religion. Focuses first on the problems faced by the Mormons in their settlement in Navo, Illinois. The trial of Joseph Smith. During that trial, Brigham Young tells him about his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he persists, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place of his colony) that gives him confidence in the health of his leadership. Later, while the crops are destroyed by the cockroaches, he again doubts that he was really chosen - yet, a miracle occurs, reinforcing his place in history. <br /> <br /> I found that the presentations were moving, and the story to be compelling and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe this is an accurate picture. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why this is essential in LDS are not raised. This problem is not confirmed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people are moving away from this film because of its religious theme, but it has a great collection and will get your attention all the time.
