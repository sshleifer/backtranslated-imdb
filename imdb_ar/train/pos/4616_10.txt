The title of this film is taken from a concert game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, New York, describing it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay", and other kissing games. According to the rules, the name of the boy and the girl would be drawn, and the electors were ordered to enter the dark closet together and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, there will be speculation among guests at parties about whether the parties have the nerve or not, and / or embrace and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the wardrobe. At the end of seven minutes, the leader of the game "End Time" or knock the door of the closet, the couple will emerge from the closet. After being questioned by other guests, the couple will have to recognize what they have done during the "seven minutes in paradise". Then other couples are chosen to enter the treasury until all the guests have participated. The couple who will be recognized will do more than win the game. <br /> <br /> These games served as social icebreakers for children and adolescents, but they can be embarrassing and frightening for shy individuals. . The film earned this title because it deals with the experiences of the first teenagers with cracking and romantic love.
