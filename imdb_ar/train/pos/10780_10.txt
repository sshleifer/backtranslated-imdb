So far through the second favorite caricature by Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, what I still enjoyed and liked, I was very impressed and impressed by the team. Both Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and were just fantastic. The whole crew was fantastic, especially the legendary Frank Wilker. <br /> <br /> I like to see this cartoon again, it was great and the jokes were great. I can also remember the funny moment in which Brain spoke a veil, heard his voice and played the PATB theme. He was wonderful, loved her in those cartoons when a hijab appeared. I hope that this cartoon and Animaniacs come back, I loved them
