David Webb's meeting with Paul Anderson ... If it sounds strange to you, you're right, because it is. <br /> <br /> People are known for their moral implications for what is right and what is wrong, the value of life, etc. ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner and Unforgiven, and in all his films there is something like that. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent film. Not surprising to have all his other movies! Here is a violent stir with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The text of the peoples is quite clear in the first half of the film. Soldiers have been trained since they were born, learned to kill, and had no normal life. They are replaced by better soldiers and genetically engineered engineers, Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left to kill him. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some of them want to keep others hate him, and there is an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullet began to fly as the new soldiers moved to the planet to conduct military maneuvers and try to kill all the people. Big and violent moves, loudly and the people's scenario turns into the Anderson Movement Festival. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written in this way, but the final product is better than expected. It is amusing, to some extent, although it is not very exciting, exciting and exciting once you start the activity. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R classification: Too much violence
