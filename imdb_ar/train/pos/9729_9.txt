The beginning is weak, the center is solid, the finish is wonderful. This is my impression on this film, anyway. I loved Simon Beige in the two films I saw in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. His collection appears as an actor, yet he really disliked his character as initially filmed. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor I call "depressing comedy". The alleged "jokes" and intelligence are not really more than painful and embarrassing moments. Much like the character of Rowan Atkinson Bean. There are a number of other comedians who portray similar characters as well. I do not mean to hit them here, so I will not. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you are like me, and that you do not like the idiots who crave madness, Pegg only displays these characteristics for the first time in a third of this movie. But it is getting better. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this depends on a real story. Hmmm. Can. The film stopped being annoying and became a kind of triumph of "Little Man" in the last third. I do not need all films to be drunk and light --- but by accident, since this film has become better, it has also become a happy ending more and more. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, playing a brilliant role. I liked the Iron Man, but I was saddened by the fact that the character of the bridges was evil. Pure personal taste, of course, because his actions were wonderful. However, it was a marvel here as a man of greater vision than life, publisher Sharps. It was good to see him in a role I can really enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, I loved it! I wish I came after 40 minutes and missed the start.
