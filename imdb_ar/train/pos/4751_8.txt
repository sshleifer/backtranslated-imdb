I have no idea why this click gets such a bad rap from many IMDb users (some say it is "the worst movie of all.") The plot is totally stupid, and it is just an excuse to suspend all the sequence of events. You expect from Jet Li? Did you honestly believe that someone had thought about the story, and then actually carried it in? Of course, the black mask is fantastic, and working from the wall to the wall is almost run-time. Cut limbs, cut heads, and creative ways to watch the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!) Are slaughtered The other Flam Li martial arts is a nursery school compared to Black Mask; there is no restraining the unjustified violence, the bloodshed or the sequence of events at all! The black mask is probably my favorite in his films (beware of terrible dubbing).
