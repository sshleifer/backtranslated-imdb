Looking at the Seven Pounds, I was not sure what to think about because the previews were left too open to understand what the film really was about. So within the first 20 minutes or so, the plot is completely lost, and you have no idea what's going on and believe that Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big idiot. All this ends when the "distortion", so to speak, is at the last minute of the film. Tim (Will Smith) was basically troubled and chased by a major accident that killed seven people. This decides to identify seven new people who need help badly and in turn give him his role. <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic, as I feel that it will sum up anything that seems to impress. For Rosario Dawson, this is one of her best films, apart from the eagle eye I think is there. I have been in bad shape for some good but they meet in this film. Other actors, such as Harlison Wood, have very small roles and do not have a role big enough to understand their character. Although filming was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was certainly not what I expected and certainly much slower in the speed I would have liked it to be. The film, however, was still good. Nothing is detected until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything falls into place. Even then it sounds like a meaningless love story. The final thought is seven pounds = seven stars.
