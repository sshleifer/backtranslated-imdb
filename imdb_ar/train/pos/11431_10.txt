I enjoyed my French language for the third year of this film very much. In a multicultural high school within the city, the film presented several topics for discussion (in French in the classroom, but I know that much of the discussion continued in English after the semester). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the relationship between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I have always mentioned that I felt that this film contained one of the most "attractive" scenes I saw in a movie. In one year, a 17-year-old African American shouted, "Yes!" When he discovered the scene: the scene in which Protée Aimée helps to wear her evening dress, while the two study the reflection of the other in the mirror. Managers use "mirroring" when they want to focus on internal conflict on one or more characters in a scene: this is an ideal example of this technique, which is "exciting." <br /> <br /> Most students have a hard time understanding the end of the film. One suggested that one subject of the film was "African." No matter how much the individual loves Africa or Africans, one can not "become" Africa (as the driver tried to do): the person must be African.
