You know the story - a group of lucky people who do not trust them enter a competition they do not seem to have a chance to win - a story that was accomplished to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best, etc.) . Now Korea gives it a chance with the Taekwondo team struggling for glory ?? And imagine what ?? The result is predictable but ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film does not fall on his face is due to the talented young actors who make you care about the characters, which in turn keeps him watching until the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed? Taekwondo does not offer the usual wave of moves and acrobatics that appear in most Kung Fu films; the action is limited to kicking (albeit impressive) and occasional punching. This does not matter, because it's the interaction of characters and their struggle to make something in itself that makes this movie successful.
