What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted to keep us early is our desire to know if Martinode had done this dirty deed. Without spoiling a lot, of course there is a red herring and evolution. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinod's flaws and the difficulty of confronting him. When there is revelation - we begin to sympathize with him and pity him because as the story progresses, we are committed to believing that he is the patient, deviant on the children we tend to think about. One of the things he has to overcome is the distant gap that he and his wife are living in though they live on the same surface. Of course, these problems are neglected in the terrible end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie requires patience and has certainly tried the problems of restless teenagers sitting in the back.
