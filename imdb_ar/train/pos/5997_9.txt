Let me start by saying that I have not reviewed a film on IMDb before; however, I am in the video Biz myself. It comes from this realization; I can say, without a doubt, that this film is what should be the short film. She has a very good story and another thing I love (the best end). The opening was good, I loved the video that was chosen for him and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W but the way this movie uses the effect it does. And with any film is all that matters. The film flow works fine and the editing has been very well done. Technically for things (which I usually work on), everything is very good. There is no major technology. Things to point out. The only slight one I have is that the credits end a little bouncy. This may be due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I'd better see more of a love scene but I'm a young man (so you can even talk up to a young worker). <br /> <br /> So, I generally do it on 9/10. It is worth watching if you are a fan of Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. Sorry for grammatical or spelling rules.
