"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own this movie on DVD! The film deals with a widow in New York (Cher) who falls in love with her angry brother (Danny Aylo) (Nicolas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won the Oscar for this film. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aylo are also fantastic. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed Fiddler On The Roof) is great. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh at. Must see! <br /> <br /> Stars!
