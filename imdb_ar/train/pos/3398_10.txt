I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was released for the first time and probably eight other times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite science fiction movies and / or Charleston's Heston. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater was at L.A. He has 12 Charlton Heston films retroactively. I traveled from outside the state to watch six films in two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. The film was wonderful from the opening montage to the family scene to the brilliant end. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, as a policeman living in a dog, eats a dog world with little remaining natural resources without understanding how the world was to be Eddie Robinson as a man remembers the past two great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is wonderful. The film also looks much better with a great 35 mm print. Fleischer really knows how to fill the screen, the cinema, the writing, the music used, and everything about it works. The film is very strong in its dark and very possible outlook for the future. Just think about how the world's population growth, the rainforest that has disappeared, the resources used, and the effect of greenhouses are getting worse since 1973. I'm just wondering why this movie has not played in theaters all these years. Her reputation must be better. <br /> <br /> When talking about reputation, people often talk as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. His vision at El-Cid, Soylent Green, Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee is back, I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Of course he made about ten great movies and for those who care about you what they are. <br /> <br />
