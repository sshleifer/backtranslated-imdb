I must say that I was impressed that the cinematography was amazing, the frames close to perfection, and the way they raised the tension around a subject that looked like a terrible apprehension was not possible. Two narrators, one seen, one invisible. Both are trying to explain the importance of a series of paintings that caused a long back scandal. The film revolves around theories and interpretations of viewpoints but the conclusion is very shocking and I have to say. Definitely a movie worth more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes left, the movie still looks like a full-fledged work. Wonderful direction! I must say much better than the blood of a poet who for some strange reason reminded me a bit. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could call it a word "Artzi". It's just a professional debate about different theories and visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz did it. At least for me. fascinating movie.
