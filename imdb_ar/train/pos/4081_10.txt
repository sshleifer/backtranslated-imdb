I have seen all the Miyazaki films, all of them beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. I liked this movie perfectly! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their friendly and friendly friendship. They were what made the film for me. Of course, the animation is also fantastic and the music captures the emotions in the film perfectly. But the characters are the bright spot in this film: they are well developed and full of character. <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English Submarines). While English is good (mostly) good, it dwindles compared to the original language version. Best voices, dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the film as it was originally.
