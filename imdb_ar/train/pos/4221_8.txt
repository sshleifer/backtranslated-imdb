I liked this episode, but it seems to me that there should have been a quick reference to punishing the minister for being an effective partner after the accident. While I like when an episode of Colombo contains an unexpected breakthrough like this, his decision must be part of the end of the episode, along with the uncovering of the killer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At some point, Gordon, who plays the role of a famous writer, makes some comments about the seduction by the famous Lt. Col., suggesting the detective's tongue in the real life of the detective as a criminal. This is one of Colombo's finest premiums.
