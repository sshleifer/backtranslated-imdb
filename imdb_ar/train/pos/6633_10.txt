The first movie ever. Workers flock from a factory, some bikes, most of them walk, and move left or right. Together with Mehlis, Lumieres both a starting point and a starting point for cinema - with Mehlis beginning narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, scenery. With pure lemire, non-decorated, observation. Truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the blotting of cinema from the latter to the tired versions of the former. <br /> <br /> But think about this briefly again. There is nothing "objective" about this. The film is full of events - a static and inhuman scene exploding in life, activity, and the tear of the quiet harmony of the frame, respected from the back to the right or left (but never, of course, where the camera is). However, the camera remains static, contains energy, and potential vandalism, subject to its will. A cinematographer may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map, modify, restrict and restrict the world. <br /> <br /> The worst is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are the workers of Lumiere. The superiors are spying on their workers, the alien eye with regard to his anonymous followers. The film thus describes two types of prison. Behind the gates, the workers are locked up in their place of work. It seems that the opening of the gate is a picture of freedom and escape, but they face another wall, the Fourth Wall, which further restricts them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of an invisible power about locking up its employees. Scary Movie, All Prophecy.
