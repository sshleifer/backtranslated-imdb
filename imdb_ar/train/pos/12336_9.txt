Melodrama was killed an excellent period, with Fontaine playing effectively against the naive flower type earlier, in the role that Olivia Dehaveland was said to have refused. This is good, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s, and later filmed the excellent script of the British film The Night of the Demon. The opening scene, where Effie visits the evil fortune-teller played by Una O'Connor (the famous scream of James the Whale), is a tour, and the film keeps the attention through many evil machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD one day, but I'm desperate about it always happening, because it seems to be an unduly mysterious film. Luckily, I've seen it on AMC since about seven or eight years, but I have not seen since. Catch him if you can!
