Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Who lived in Ireland in the 1920s, Gibo and his Irish colleagues are part of an underground revolt against the British oppressors. One of the rebels, wanted to be killed by the British, returns to the city secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Guipo, but the £ 20 bonus proved very tempting. Gypo makes his friend kill and drown in the pit of despair and sugar. At the same time, other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Immediately, Gypo, who burns money in his pocket, is considered the main suspect, but they, his friends, do not want to believe it. The Informer's story is simple in its plots, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It is one of John Ford's most emotional films. What Gobo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his unfortunate personality, and there is a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very fishy, ​​as well. It's a kind of thrill where we're absolutely sure we know how everything will end, so we have to grind our teeth and bear with them. Great acting. Victor McLaughlin, who has been involved in many Ford films, may have performed his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). All other artists in the film deserve him or her. In addition to stunning script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressive films. I love the dark side of Ford. In her mood, as well as in her subjects, the detective reminds me of two of my other favorite films of Ford, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948), and somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940). 10/10.
