Sports movies have never been anything to me, but a handful of them work with me. The best ones are those who focus less on sport and more on personality, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great debut by Karyn Kusama, and Michelle Rodriguez's first outstanding performance. Girlfight feels realistic and includes both, and this is enough to make it an unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> The plot is misleading enough forward. Diana Guzman, in her fourth year of high school, but because of her battles at the entrance, they are about to be expelled. As a possible way to unleash her anger, she participated in boxing lessons at the club where her brother was training (his father's wish). <br /> <br /> Within ninety minutes, we viewers see something unusual. Diana turns almost literally from girl to woman. We see her in her body as well as her behavior, especially when he finds one of the boys in the club attracted to her, and join him. There is no bad scene or lame moment / contrived in the film. The only mistake that can be said to be corrected is that one of the sub-schemas ends up appearing to be incomplete. Apart from that, Girlfight is a wonderful movie.
