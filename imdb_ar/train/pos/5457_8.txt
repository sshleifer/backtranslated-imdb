This film is one of the most up-and-coming black and white films of this time in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts code was applied. It is the story of a beautiful young woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers. Which is already doing fairly well with its performance. Leila moves to New York and makes her way to the workplace to sleep with all the men. Stanwick performs well as a strong woman who uses men as a one-time deal, and hardly any emotion towards them plays as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love in her mind just force and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was a bit different from the other films I saw because there is hardly any background music I heard. I think the reason is only when people were introduced for the first time to live sound and dialogue among the people of the film. The few times the music is heard are at first showing how to make their way in the series. The sights and the different sights were fantastic! The director of this film made all the right angles and all the right tricks, which made the film full of realism. <br /> <br /> This film together was a good film. The end of the film was not as good as it should have been, but it did not completely destroy it. Baby Face got slow-moving scenes during the movie, and maybe some predictable parts like the one you'll sleep with afterwards. But this is a lovable movie that can be seen more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
