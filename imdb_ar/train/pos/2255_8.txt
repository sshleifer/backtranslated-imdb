Not bad martial arts. The fighting scenes were good. Michelle Keissy did a good job in directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without foul language and lots of blood. Screenwriter Janet Francisca has a good line of story that works. It would be great to see something else in the same kind. She loves art and strong women. It was definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all lovers of the arts of drama and fighting.
