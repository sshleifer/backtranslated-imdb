Making the film Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a nice film, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is as wonderful as usual, but some scenes in the film seem misplaced, and romance between them and van Hevelin develops very quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, in a minute he is ready to beat them. But the next moment falls in love with her. I think this production, movie editing, and script (although the photography was fantastic, the scenery was fantastic and also nice fashion) it could have been a bit better. It seems as if the production has been too rushed. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good, especially Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter of Rosie's daughter. She is 11 years old, looks really nice and it is a shame that she has not developed into a teen comic actress. It is much better in this film than it was in its previous films like Warner Brothers in the late 1930's (except the Broadway Musketeers 1938, it's really good at that), when they tried to convert it to Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. In general, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
