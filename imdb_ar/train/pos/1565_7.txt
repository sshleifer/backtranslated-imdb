I just saw The St Strikes Back for the first time and found it very good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as Saint, replacing Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting incident in a nightclub. With the help of an acquaintance, Inspector Vernak, who came down from New York, they are helping the daughter of a crime leader. <br /> <br /> Joining Sanders in the team is Wendy Barry and Jonathan Hill. <br /> Not a bad St. movie. deserve watching. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
