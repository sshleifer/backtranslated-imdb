The election is a Chinese film of mobs, or triads in this case. There is a biennial election to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems difficult between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fei, or as I know him, "the other Tony Leung") and Luke (Simon Yam, who was in full contact!). Despite winning Lok, Big D refuses to accept the option and does his best to ensure recognition as a new leader. Unlike any other Asian film I watch with gangsters, this is not an action film. It has bloody moments, when necessary, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are a lot of characters that are really hard to track, but I think it's a little crazy. A 100-year-old baton, the symbol of power I mentioned before, changes hands several times before things settle down. Although it may seem that the film ends at 65 or 70 minutes, there are still some big surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and somehow based on the picture. <br /> <br /> The award was the winner at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny Toe, Heroic Trio !!), and Best Screenplay. She also received nominations for filmmaking, editing, degree films (which she liked) and three other performances of acting (including Yam).
