Kuthani, I must say that this film has Magickal importance if any. It is a magical film "fun" and is not meant to teach us anything but love is the strongest Magik, never used in a dominant or retaliatory way. This is a lesson that everyone needs to learn, not just pagans. <br /> <br /> After the movie was said it was beautifully written and executed by Kim Novak and the esteemed Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold presents a great show where Bianca, Elsa Lancaster (with many movie credits to be mentioned except for Mrs. Jane Marbles of "Death by Death") was wonderful as Mrs. Novak's neighbor upstairs was Queens . Also starring Jack Lemmon (great performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly proficient). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry, why can not they shed one tear because their heart is full of magic ... You do not have time for silly things like love." Quincy. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nikki (Jack Lemmon) are witches in Manhattan. Deeply hidden inside the secret underworld of that craft, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without causing too many eyebrows. <br /> <br /> But then comes Shepard "Shep" Henderson (Stuart), a stolid and meaningless businessman who is getting married to an old college rival in Gillian. <br /> <br /> Through a sudden expression of chance, he finds himself moving to Gillian's building, which is "magic" instantly through its charm and grace. By using Magick, with little help from Pyewacket (Gillian familiar, coached by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian began to work on this handsome new dream man to return to her old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magik should not be used to control, do not hurt, Gillian learns that the hard way the most bitter way. Not only does she face what she has done, but she also faces Shep in her guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; however, the film takes a dangerous turn: the effects are so dated that it is a pure camp. Some of the scenes were filmed in the basement of a small person's house, but at least the characters were crooked and fun. <br /> <br /> In a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Great cat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a Trivia note, these are the roots of the popular television comedy Bewitched. This presents Samantha and Darren the original. All memo characters are present and calculated. Just search, to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite things, and I see it a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9.1 / 10. <br /> <br /> The villain :.
