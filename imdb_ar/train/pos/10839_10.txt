I've been watching this movie in the video store for a few years and hired it. My husband and I have enjoyed VHS and have enjoyed it ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot was well discussed, so there's no need to beat it again. The point is that this movie deserves frequent scenes. Americans, in particular, will not get all the jokes the first time. I know I did not. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching and sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes toast at his daughter's wedding, it will irritate. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he tries to kiss her, it's sad. When Beano is finally squeezed by a black woman, it is very funny for words. <br /> <br /> Music: It's as good as any soundtrack I've heard about in years. I was dancing in the living room on "all over the world". <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Naye was honored for filming Rae, a man who made many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect like Tony, the beloved keyboard player who has carried Karen's torch all these years. He has an attractive aesthetic look that makes the woman want his hug. But all actors are equally wonderful. <br /> <br /> Ignore any articles you read about this movie and see it. It's a gem.
