After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally ends up inside a bottle of invisible ink, which was part of a chemical group. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so the expected results occur, meaning that he uses his new hidden state to torture Tom. Jerry often defends himself, but often has a sadistic scream that tortures the cat whenever possible, even when he is not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here, Tom makes him think his eyes are deceiving him when they get a rat trap. Disappears before his eyes, or milk from a dish. Tom can no longer take a nap, so he tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry fires in his hideout! Man, I hope the young children did not think of watching these cartoons in the forties and fifties! I have always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than the gentle. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, whatever damage a character has gone has gone in seconds and returned to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom explores what the story is with Jerry, and tries different ways to discover where the mouse is (like placing the exact ground to see his footprints).
