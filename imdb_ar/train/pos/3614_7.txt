Girlfight is like cooking for your grandmother: the same old recipe you tried a million times ago, yet somehow turned into something new and new. Try and explain the story to people who have never seen it before: young women from the wrong side of the tracks are trying to improve their position by taking boxing while dealing with a sick and disabled father and her increasing attractiveness to a male competitor. Watch them as they roll their eyes in the cliche chain, and they are right: it is * clich√©head. However, I have been very impressed by the success of this film, often because of its wonderful acting and dialogue, and the sensitive direction that makes it "new." I avoided this in the cinema because it looked like complete folly but did not make the same mistake it did. Definitely worth a look.
