Raul Walsh was like Michael Bay in the 1940s and years before. I mean it in a positive way, since I certainly am not a fan of eBay. His films are just high quality entertainment, just like Raoul Walsh films in his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is a good quality entertainment. Along with a first-class director, also has first class actors, with the regular lead man of Raul Walsh Errol Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the boxing games were on screen. They used some very dynamic camera work, making the boxing games very impressive and spectacular, as the final battle against John Sullivan was the highlight. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the autobiography that emerged in the 1940s and earlier is still very different from the biographies being presented today. Modern biographies often glorify their main theme and show his / her life from birth to death and everything, mostly from the emotional aspects. Old films were made only like films that did not rely on real people in real life, which also means that filmmakers often use a degree of creative freedom with the personality of the main character and the events that occurred in his / her life. This film is not just a biography of the boxing legend, but it also represents a nice picture of the period in which the illegal bare battles entered the modern age of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job of portraying reality. The life of famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Jim Gentleman. Not many people knew that, but Flynn did some good real stuff in the 1940s, which is one of them. Fysicaly as it looks in the upper shape. He also looks quite different by the way without his little drinker brand in this film. The film also features some beautiful supporting actors and some good work all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and fun movie that's still wonderful. <br /> <br /> 8/10
