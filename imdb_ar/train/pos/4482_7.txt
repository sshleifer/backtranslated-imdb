ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two passionate sailors, Joe Brady (Jane Kelly) and Clarence Doolittle / Brooklyn (Frank Sinatra), getting a private beach break for four days. They are eager to reach the girls, especially Joe Lula, Joe and Brooklyn, about the crazy little Donald County (Dean Stockwell) and his aunt Suzie (Catherine Grayson). Without experience in female ways and flirtation, Brooklyn quickly devised Joe to help him win Aunt Susie. Along the way, however, Joe finds himself falling in the way he thinks belongs to his best friend. How will Brooklyn take this betrayal? Does Joe end up with Susie, who also loves him? <br /> <br /> The first and second time I saw the Terraces was appalling, I also saw them at the same time as I did in The Town, Kelly / Sinatra Collaboration of 1949. Each time I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the best film in terms of planning The structure - all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot, and they twist characters and story rather than block them. However, every time you go away I feel that ON THE TOWN is the best film overall. Having now seen both films for the third time, I still support this provision. One way or another on the city, as a movie and a piece of entertainment, it is just lighter and warmer and more simply and simply * happier *. The numbers are more intriguing and less integrated in the plot, yet they work better than all the dances and vocals in ANCHORS AWEIGH. I'm not quite sure why this. The usual argument is that the last film is too long: in about two and a half hours, this is certainly true criticism. I definitely felt the first length twice I saw it! However, it is also a film that grows on you - the more you see it, the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery in its making. However, there is something that does not stop together completely. It seems as if the text is written, and every single moment Kelly can break into a dance or Sinatra into a song, and that's exactly what happened. No chance of a musical number has been abandoned ... perhaps the biggest weakness of the film. It has 16 numbers (few or few), and no matter how big your fans are in Kelly or Sinatra, it really starts to change numbness after a while. (Compare this, for example, with the 10 numbers on ON THE TOWN.) You may well feel that every song and every dance can not be taken out of the movie without leaving it lacking ... This is true. But this is also because the writers were not more restricted in adding them in the first place. <br /> <br /> All this long preamble does not mean that there is nothing good about the AWEIGH anchor. The music is funny with great songs exploding everywhere, such as the duets between Kelly and Sinatra ("We Hate to Leave", "I've Received It" and "If You Know Suzy"), Sinatra's ("What Makes the Sunset, It is also hard to miss a group of caliber. "Grayson is sweet and seems to be improving every watch (her voice becomes amazing and not scary); The role of Jos√© Iturbi is sympathetic and does a great job with him; even Brooklyn in Clarence, Pamela Breton, nice and attractive ... The closest one can get to my home is Garret without me Sinatra is amazing with those blue eyes and curls of his, and plays the innocent innocent boy (a role played in ON THE TOWN), which is, as usual, simply flawless to pronounce even timing and wording. A bit, but when you have a horn sound, its presentation may be a good reason to slow down the rest of the film! <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly's phenomenal genius deserves a special paragraph in his third billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively ANCHORS AWEIGH is really a Kelly movie. Joe Brady is a real believable character - he's tough from the outside, absent and ready to lie when necessary to win a festival, but he's actually the biggest fool from the inside. Kelly makes this charming and not attractive, but gives the atmosphere a real advantage you see in the scene when Joe Brooklyn is chasing around the room with a really deadly look on his face and a breakfast tray in his hands. Dance * - Again, the film suffers from the syndrome of "a lot of good things that spoil the effect," as happens with singing Sinatra. But again, if Jane Kelly makes the soft couch, or clicks on the screen in the clothes of a sailor or wears a bandit's headgear ... she may miss the extra bit! All of Kelly's dances are impressive, whether it's the reduced simplicity of his industrial number with Sinatra to "I Begged Her", "Mexican Hat Dance" with the little girl with wide eyes, or his luxurious Spanish-influenced dance "La Compresita. The classic that has been left in the minds of the public all the time is Kelly, wearing a red, white and blue sailor suit, dancing with the famous Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry.Not sure that the memory of a worthy golden film - you can not say you were impressed with the special effects in a 1945 film , Given CGI saturation in the contemporary film market The only people who can really keep up with Gene Kelly are Kelly (himself covering the girl) and animation animation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is necessary, but there is still a few hours of entertainment. Watch it first then again and maybe again - it will grow on you before you realize it! 7.5 / 10
