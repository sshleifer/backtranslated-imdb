This was a wonderful film that had a lot of troubling issues. I have dealt with issues of fascism and class. But, she also had a message that defines yourself and takes responsibility for yourself. It was a very deep film. It gave the message that you alone could control your destiny. It has also shown that knowing yourself and being comfortable with your identity is the only way that suits you in society. What others think of you is not important. I think this film did a great job of showing it. The actors think they were able to convey every wonderful figure. I thought it was amazing how deep this film really was. Through the passing glance, you will not see how deep the film, but in another look, you will see the basic meaning of the film.
