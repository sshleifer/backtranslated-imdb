Downer forced the magician around a male impostor in New York City to live in a building sentenced to jail with a fraudulent person. A very bleak study of the contemporary moral and social decline, and very well directed by John Schlesinger (who never took his place here) and acted excellently by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Bundle packs In general, however, the "fictional" scenes - some of which are played in a chuckle - are somewhat intrusive, as is the "modern" drug party. The relationship that developed between the two men is emotional, but filmmakers are keen not to feel cheerful, and this gives the picture an advantage that may not have less of an outlet than Schlesinger. Originally the X was rated in 1969, the Oscar winner was the best picture; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who wrote the book James Leo Herreli) and Schlesinger also won the statues. *** 1/2 of ****
