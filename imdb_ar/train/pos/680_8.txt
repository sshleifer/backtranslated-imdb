"The Last Wave" is one of those films that rely heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Apocalypse of the Apocalypse: There will be a final wave that destroys everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a lawyer in Sydney who has been appointed to defend some indigenous people accused of murder. Around this time, there was unusually heavy rainfall in Australia. During the defense of the indigenous people, David recognizes the theory of the last wave, and begins to wonder if they are just legends. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the last film represents a metaphor for the descent into the depths of an individual's mind. Peter Ware created a puzzling but thought-provoking film. Native actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") presents an interesting supporting role as a defendant. <br /> <br /> An opportunity, watch the "Made" feature on the DVD. Peter Ware explains some of the basic tones of the film, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
