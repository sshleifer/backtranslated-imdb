After watching the movie directly, Faye showed the true magical feelings of Walt Disney movies and realized that I had long seen "real" magic in the film. <br /> <br /> A combination of proper music, speeches and magic effects brings a Disney feeling back into your body. Very special things I saw where the unknown influences began in the film, where the Disney logo turned to Cinderella Castle and ended as a fictional story telling an old story with your ancestors. <br /> <br /> Magic returned to me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
