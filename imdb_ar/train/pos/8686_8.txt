The second official episode of "Colombo" ("Murder by the Book", which was filmed later, hit the airwaves first). Robert Kolb, who will emulate intelligence with investigator Peter Falk in several future installments, is wonderful as a short head of the sophisticated detective agency that kills a client's wife when she refuses to submit to extortion schemes. The two stars were well matched in this smart cat and mouse exercise, which is one of the best in the series.
