Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, great songs, and dances, with special reference to "Portobello Ballet". For the animation section, the game became an instant classic animal; its culmination with the attack on the armature is chilling and magnificent. I recommend viewing 134 minutes restored or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy, we have only 98 minute version, although the movie was introduced in the original version in 117 minutes running. If possible, watch the German video as well: It was created 98 minutes in a row but is missing from every reference to World War II and all scenes between the English people and the Nazi invaders!
