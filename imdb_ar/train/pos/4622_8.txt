Originally, Linda Feferman's "The Seven Minutes in Heaven" came when I was 14 and worked at a video store and loved it. I recently saw the film again and realized it was a lost treasure. Movie stars Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years ago would have continued to win the Oscar for the beautiful game, as Natalie Baker. Byron Times plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is certainly a milder and lighter version of The Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful of the 1980s, which is why it is so good. He's honest, he does not have to have such films, and parents will enjoy watching this film with children there. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he must move because his life at home is absorbing. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, who played beautifully by Maddy Kurman, allowed him to do so. But this film is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can escape. The three threads are very natural and the scenario, very surprising, is that the best that can be achieved in their performance is a broken heart. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie to show kids who reach pre-teen. <br /> <br />
