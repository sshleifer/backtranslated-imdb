"Cry of Freedom" is not just a film. It is a historical story, a heroic story and an insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a great job of impersonating a strong and motivated hero, Steve Biko, but sends a message to the public about the horrors of apartheid in the south of Arferican. The story of Pico, the influential leader, and his main "influence", Donald Woods, is a tragic story. But the ultimate success in his life could go beyond atrocities in South Africa. Cry Freedom managed to connect its audience with the optimistic side of the seemingly disturbing plot. Because of such big films, the public can learn about the terrible events in history, the great leaders who sought to put an end to them, and how we can not allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is a wonderful movie that everyone should see.
