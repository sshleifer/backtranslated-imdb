I loved this show from its first broadcast and I was always looking forward to watching every episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special effects were fantastic! Then he set up the science fiction channel again and canceled a well written entertainment show. I say, I repeat, I know that all parties will return. I would suggest buying a DVD, I am. I hope that the executives in the science fiction channels will receive these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only watch one program on this channel now (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure it will be canceled soon too.
