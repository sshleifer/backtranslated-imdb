Do not listen to the unified critics on this, it's a gem! Young rich Joanne and her brother find themselves bankrupt after the death of their father - now they have to work for a living! She, of course, becomes a reporter, which is, of course, a mob driver! Through wild accidents, their careers meet face-to-face, thanks to Clark Jable bands. In the meantime, there is a chance to wear underwear of moonlight moon to a bunch of beautiful little things and to Zhuan to make a number of rookie dance numbers (with each blessing steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's very fun in those wonderful days that preceded the code, when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great, and offers a lot of emotional grouping that will give her career this long life (thank God she stopped dancing!). Gable is great as a funny man - he was not a star yet and did not have to be a hero. Great to see him play something different. William Bakewell is as excellent as poor poor brother. There are some great montage and courtesy shots of director Harry Beaumont, who takes the article at an accelerated pace - and a casual jolt to the audience! Great fun!
