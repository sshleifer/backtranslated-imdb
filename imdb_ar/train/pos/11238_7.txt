Hidden Frontier is a fan-created show in the world of Star Trek. The story unfolds after the return of Voyager from the Delta Quadrant. Contains some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most are original in the show. The exhibition is held at Deep Space 12 and many spacecraft, giving it opportunities that do not have official displays. The characters have an opportunity to rise in the hierarchy, which is not owned by the characters displayed in one ship only. The show contains good computer animation of spacecraft, but the representation takes place in front of the green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most of them are okay. Episodes are character driven and characters evolve across many episodes. This is a bit like Babylon 5, more than most official Star Trek programs. Take the hidden boundaries taboos that have shrunk from their use until the official serial. All in all I enjoyed watching it.
