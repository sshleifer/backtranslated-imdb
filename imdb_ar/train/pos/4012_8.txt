After some difficulties, Johnny went to his uncle's uncle's farm to take day-to-day operations, only to see that the old man had been killed by his beautiful wife, who was digging for gold and her evil brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, Marc Damon's admirable performance, and the full-blown animated scenario combine to make this amusing, if not exceptionally deep, addition to the Western type of spaghetti. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European children ever to honor the screen. She is perfectly perfect as a sympathetic (and abusive) user of a weak man. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one picture, The Devil's Wedding Night, a very good horror film of special interest to those of you who want to see what under Rosalba dresses.
