WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with recovering his precious possessions, a Winchester-made duplicate gun. The gun keeps changing hands, and Stuart stubbornly retains afterwards. This effort by Anthony Mann in 1950 for war and production is a crime film rather than a traditional Western one. Cowboys often look more like modern-day gangs than old-fashioned cowboys. Play Shelley Winters Role of a woman of dubious virtue heading to a farm with a man (Charles Drake) may get married. It ended up falling in Stewart, but not before it was passed a little. Winters is the most complex character in a film full of unusual characters. Watch Dureyea Young Dan assassin Jose and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Misc sadly Will Gear plays White Earb.
