After reading only two of the comments here, as a lifelong Bronte fan, starting with Olivier Heathcliff and always with the numerous versions of "Rochester" of Charlotte, it is more important to see that the sister of Ononson Bronte is the one that gave lie in the period of the triple male chauvinist inhabited. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the 19th century British domestication is that "girls" were all "naked" and that their only realistic brushes with "men" were their lead father and their waste? brother. However, finally, ANNE Bronte, in her individual test, has demonstrated the "feminist" point, advancing on contemporary species, including the "right to vote" classification. However, history shows more than a few of those who preceded it, including the Greek Hetai, Savo and the likes of the ancient Emperor Yang Kui-fi. What about "Eve" and her apple?
