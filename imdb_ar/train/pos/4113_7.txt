The title is the sound one character makes as he drives a fake cart through the landfill where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who live effectively in dilapidated houses on the edge of the landfill. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> Akria Kurasowa's first color film was something I wanted to see for a long time. It is strange that they are often listed as available only in a shortened version of an original three or four hours due to a run-time error in some promotional material. I support the full version, waiting to know what we wanted to see Coruso, just to see the latest version Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally, sat down to see the movie last night I am mixed feelings about the film. First of all visually linked with each film follows. You can see all of the remaining 6 Kurasowals movies reflected in this film, up to the painted sunset. It's a great movie to use in color and you can understand why it took a long time to stock the movies he'd be happy with (of course there are also failed projects). The film is a visual art work (though you will be warned if you see this on your widescreen TV, this 1.33 has been shot to appear in the normal TV ratio.) The rest of the movie is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not gather. As separate tales all work well but as a whole my film they do not hang one. I do not blame Corusua because one can not always get things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, who specializes in multi-character films of this kind, sometimes bombs himself. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there are no reasons to see the movie. As with all Kurosawa films, there are always reasons to watch his films, whether they work or not. The first trip of the "trolley" is one of the best things Kurasowa ever did and worth the rent. It is one of the most magical moments in the history of the film where the vehicle is examined and removed. The father and son who live in the car (despite his deep sadness at the end) are touched and there are parts and other parts that shine (such as beautifully cast) and one must try the film at least as something different from a man usually associated with samurai movies or crime plays. <br /> <br /> It's an intriguing twist from a major film director, which in this case is better than the successes of other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much higher in the pieces.
