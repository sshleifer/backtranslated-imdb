It's a wonderful movie, about one person's dreams and driving or pushing for them. It is a beautiful and inspiring film. Why should some people try to find a mistake with every movie coming out, especially good movies. Dennis Quid performs well in this true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher and baseball trainer who was pushed by his team to take another shot in a professional baseball career. With an excellent support team, including Brian Cox, as a tough old naval officer who left many of his son's achievements passing without his support. It was good to see him as something other than the villain in a movie. If I have one complaint about this film: Do not let Royce Abelgate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film belongs to a handful of big baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." It rates two thumbs up and a big "well done".
