I read many mixed reviews and many of them broke the film. I was originally interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Mann On Fire had a great influence on me. Before I start my review, let me first say this ... It is wonderful to see that this film could have been said in a boring and ordinary way, but the writers and Scott chose a different way. <br /> <br /> Land: <br /> <br /> Simply stated, it's not boring. Most Hollywood films offer "tried and true" plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring public acceptance of the film and creating a greater potential for profit. This plot was one of the most interesting I have ever seen. For reference only, I recently watched "The Weather Man" and "Lord of War" and while I will say that these films are excellent, I enjoyed them both tremendously, both conspiracies in these films are muted and are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. Do not take any chances at all, and very predictable after watching a fair amount of American films. Domino's intriguing plot was told in a way that makes you think, "Hey man, I've become tight now." I feel there has been a shortage of many modern films. In my opinion it has a lot of depth and gives you a lot of things to ask while watching it. In general, that's what made me interested in the film. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were accurate. Knightley did a great job of photographing a beautiful woman, who was only present at home and wanted to be seen as what she was. It was clear that she wanted to prove herself and took all the necessary means to achieve it. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very certified, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as the problems of jealousy within the team ... all rant to me, making me feel his personality was more realistic . <br /> <br /> Rourke's character has been the least interesting to me, but it's still true to me. He looked like an ordinary man, trying to cover their expenses. I hope this is what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what I came out of. He did a very good job of showing Ed in the Joe Average game that committed his mistakes, yet still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I think they gave a much needed heart to the story. They were not just people getting money to buy Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem, and others were trying to achieve that. You can sympathize with them because this child's illness was a problem with any other solution. These characters were supposed to show less fortunate real people who entered the mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Mob: They have made the story seem evil in a way that only mobs can. I really liked this part. They have also compiled the story with small complications that made the plot more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Woken / 90210 Youth: <br /> <br /> They provided comic relief in a very serious film. Ranging from Waughn's embarrassing remarks to continuing references to 90210 youth. Their participation in the film made them more fun only. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... Yes .... Cinema. Here it seems that this film has lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion I thought he was a genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was very effective in my opinion. I thought it was a way to get it right, but it could always use optimization, just like anything else. I salute and congratulate Scott, the editor, photographer and director of photography for some real opportunities in this film. Not only did they go further with their offer, they went much further. The use of colors, whether too light or too dark, gave the film's "appearance" a wicked and bold appearance that accurately depicts the lives of mobs, reward hunters and less fortunate people in a way that shows that their lives are not "peachy" or "clean." That in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks, if any, indicating that Scott and his crew were trying to do something with that look and not only did he realize that most people who watched this movie did not expect it and that Many of them have been turned off for this movie but I think it's wonderful that Scott followed this Hollywood movies have grown to be predictable and cute ... Most of them are shot in the same way with the same twists and turns, and I'm glad Scott tried to do something different. I would like to recommend this to everyone, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with a little. "I have to agree with a previous poster when I do not have anything to say. He said that many of those who reject the vision outside the "MTV range" will not appreciate this film, but I think many people They will. We must all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott & Co.. He took some chances and tried to offer something different and unique. With that in mind, I think it worked very well.
