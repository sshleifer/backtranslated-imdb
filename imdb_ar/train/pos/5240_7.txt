Some representation was a little suspect. I remember that the zombie Alexander Walker (evening evening critic, yes well, he's dead now) was fired in a hustle about this film, saying it was a disgrace portraying the Protestants NI as murderers. Now for all the protesters from NI, this film relied heavily on the Shankill (who were loyal) butchers who traveled to Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, the butchers were not called for nothing. The main anime about this film is that there is no glimmer of light or hope, all of which is doomed to depression, meaning that the little girl in the end must die. This may sound trite, but it could have been a trick that not all Prods & tiags are bad or completely good either.
