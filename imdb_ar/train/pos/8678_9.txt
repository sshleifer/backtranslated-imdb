Butch Peace Maker? Clear. After a violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry swinging away from each other, Butch calls for a stop and wants to know why. It's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can go along with dogs, do not they?" Asks Tom, who nodded his head by agreement. "Mice can go along with cats, right?" Jerry hints "no" and then finds that this is not the right solution. <br /> <br /> Go inside and Putch paints a "peace treaty" (complete with professional works!). Most of the rest, the bulk of the cartoons, the three of them are very nice to each other, what a change in the pace of change. I found it fun to watch. I can have a million of these fees that surpass each other on the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you know that peace will not last. A large piece of steak foretells the death of the Peace Treaty but on its way it was a nice change and it still had some usual humor from Tom and Jerry.
