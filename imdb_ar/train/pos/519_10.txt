I saw this film for the first time in almost 20 years and never forgot it. It was beautifully filmed and the story kept one set up all the time. It's hard to believe that this was done in 1946, as the story is still alive today, and one is really thinking. I'm not very familiar with the film technology, but the special effects in this film are great when you think about making this film. In addition, the representation is superb, and the use of English and American actors is very stunning. I recently purchased the DVD so far I am able to watch whenever you want. I strongly recommend anyone interested in British films after the war to watch this.
