Barker and Stone produce their lively, bizarre humor from their animated masterpiece to a long-term film with generally good results. Most of the movie is Trey and Matt running around with their new box. The plot is the same simplicity: two ordinary people are embarking on a new sport, a combination of arcade basketball with baseball registration becoming a national craze.

Great reliance on the "Naked Gun / Airplane" equation. Parker and Stone can do something really cool (or very bad) if they're fully controlled in a future film. America, either lock these guys or put them in power.
