Sergeant Reker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War, a pending crime. And has long been followed out of court by Marshal during that time sergeant. Must remain in a military prison. After a lot of investigation, the defense lawyer tries to acquit the non-convict at the eleventh hour. Very good picture.
