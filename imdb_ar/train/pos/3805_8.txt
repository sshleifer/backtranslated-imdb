After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never reached the theaters, so BluRay requested it. I had a great time watching it and I say that this film is better than some of the main animation films there. Of course, they have their flaws but I can still recommend them. The animation was well done, entertaining and unique. The story kept me watching until the end. Some backgrounds are just fantastic, and you can see the French talent behind them. I thought that Forrest Whitaker's performance felt somewhat boring, but that's how Lian Chu's character is portrayed in this film. Overall, excellent, I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough for all the studios concerned to continue making great movies like this. I would recommend giving her a chance and be surprised at how wonderful the film is with a small budget. Hektor deserves to watch the film because some of his moments resemble a stitch.
