"Sataya Earth" is one of the finest films made in Indian cinema. This director is directed by the great director Govind Nehalani, the most successful Hit Heat parallel film, which has also been commercially successful. To this day, Satya Sataya is an inspiration to all the leading directors in India. <br /> <br /> The film tells the real life police scenario in Mumbai in the 1970s. Unlike any police in other cities in India, the Mumbai police have a completely different system. Govind Nehalani creates a "very practical Outlay" with a real lifestyle for Mumbai police police. <br /> <br /> The film depicts, among various police officers and colleagues, the story of Anand Vilankar, a young policeman with blood coming from a poor man. a family. His father is a tough police officer. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and his father's horrific incidents on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime is a passive passion for his job satisfaction. The film revolves here in a scheme where Anand's ongoing efforts to combat crime are trampled by the elderly. This leads to frustration, because it can not achieve the desired job satisfaction. Because of the frustrations, his anger is expressed through excessive violence in detention rooms and bars, and also turns him into an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> The spirit inside is still alive, because it is constantly fighting the system. He is familiar with the metro system, where police and politicians are mistakenly linked. His compromise towards immoral practice is negative. Finally, it is suspended. <br /> <br /> The Direction is a master piece and a perfectly solid essence. One of the best unforgettable scenes is Anand when he broke into the house of a gangster in Rama Shetty to the outside world to catch him, followed by a wonderful short conversation. In many scenes, the film has exciting moments. <br /> <br /> The practical approach to the script is a big punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage and deception are all part and parcel of Mumbai police today. These aspects are handled brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the One-Man program, where Om Puri filmed Anand Velankar, who crosses all his emotions brilliantly.
