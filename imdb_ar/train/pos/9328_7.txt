The ideal son is a story about two brothers made up of thirty things, one of which seems to be "perfect" and the other who is basically engaged, often landing in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of their father, the two are combined after a long absence and the appearance of the usual brotherly rivalry. The irresponsible little brother will not even move until the "ideal" younger brother is finally taken, making him finally move to take on his life and assume some responsibility. <br /> <br /> A great work in the history of the "return" of the younger brother, although it may seem a bit elusive (striking drug addiction is not that easy). What makes the film more rewarding is the treatment of AIDS, a subject that has become somewhat complex in cinema over the past 5-10 years. The development of an almost sweet relationship between the two rival brethren is also reasonable and well executed. Both major actors were highly qualified, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A strong initial effort is directed by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose brother died of AIDS. The end is done well too. <br /> <br />
