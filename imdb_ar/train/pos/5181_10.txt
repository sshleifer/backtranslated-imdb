I really enjoyed this film in general, but there are four things that really stand out: the perfect timing and comic performance of Sam Remy as the camp man (?), The great Alan Arkin described the camp owner and, most of all, cinema. The beautiful golden colors of the outdoor scenes attract me to the film, such as the sunset on the lake shore, to my summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and mood seem very natural and believable. Some critics criticize the lack of a more profound text. For me, this is exactly the shortcoming that makes this movie work. The characters and their problems seem real, and that's why I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the parts are gathered to create everything that seems right.
