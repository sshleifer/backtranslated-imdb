I liked these films that another Yash raj you know will look good on the screen, all of its characters will be nice or very nice with one exception you know it will end up nice ... Another rule of the movie Yash raj is either hero or heroine; no one. Think again in all those movies .. MBK Suman did not have my mom, HMAPK did not have Salman and Dean, and the final rule is that 90% are likely to see Alok Nath cry ... <br /> Movie Very good It's a little slow at first but keep you enjoying. There is almost no comedy but it makes you smile a lot enough. The little boy (the hero's nephew) is in good shape and offers very good linings. The actress is very beautiful but you are shy that you will not get it in real life. This movie does not contain happy big happy families living in a big house I was a good idea and allowed the film to distinguish from other movies. There will be a lot of women crying at the end of the film. There is no strong message from this film, but it is a good hour. If you are married (arranged marriage), the film will remind you of what you have experienced. If they are not, they will inform you and may scare you ... <br /> <br /> In general, a very good movie. No big plots or distortions but a very nice movie, much like the classic Bollywood.
