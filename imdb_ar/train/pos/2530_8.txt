From the joys of picking up Bela Lugosi's latest collection watch exhilarating movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bella Lugosi cooperate in a film that moves to meteorites and radiation. While the science is completely ridiculous (especially camera technology, Karloff uses Janus Rukh to locate a meteor), he is not entirely interested in the lease because the film is quite enjoyable. The effects are well done for time, the representation is great, and the end is very strong. It reminds me of comics and science fiction novels in the 1940s and 1950s, complete with radiologists and ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
