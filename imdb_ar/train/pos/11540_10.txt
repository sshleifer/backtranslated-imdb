This is the work of Neil Simon who got a lot of praise! The "strange couple" is one of the precious gems that still exist. Felix Anger (Jack Lemmon); hypochondriac, fussy, fussy, and a big fork in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matau); These guys have great jobs though. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is close, while Oscar is on the other side of the United States (West Coast). Well when can you say? Two men who live in one roof without causing madness to each other, is impossible and impossible. It is a great group of laughter and lots of fun. I loved the part he spoke with these two British neighbors who spoke to both gentlemen, and after Oscar Felix was expelled, he became lucky and lived with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night before. It's time Felix needs to lighten it up. I think all neat neat freaks to lighten up. It can be difficult, but you must also be patient. Very interesting movie, classic nuevo. Neil Simon's "Strange Couple" is a must to watch the classic movie. 5 stars!
