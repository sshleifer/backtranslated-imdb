A meteorite collides with the Crater Lake, the heat caused by hatching a prehistoric egg. <br /> <br /> Well, so this land is just rubbish. But despite its low budget, this film is one of the most gripping and entertaining monster films. There are also some good moments of humor. In an age full of so-called "monsters" that are nothing more than laughable creations of men in rubber or lizards dressed in frills and forced to tear each other into pieces (similar to cheap exploitation), it is refreshing to discover Plesiosaur in this small gem is an excellent creature of the movement Similar to Harryhausen. <br /> <br /> It's a hard-to-find movie, but it's worth it.
