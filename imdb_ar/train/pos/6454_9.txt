I saw this film again at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and out of 14 films I saw there, I will classify this as my third film. I had an initial interest in seeing this original of Swedish origin with many of my grandparents from the Norland region of Sweden where this was filmed. It also grew up in a North American rural forest area where many small cities were much like the preparation of this film. It's good to see more movies using rural locations, such as SÃ¥ som i Himmelen. It was a very good film and I'm sure it's a very difficult film to bring together with a great band, but director Kay Bullock managed to get the film out after nearly two decades of absence. Helen Segolm was in her first film appearance as a great actress and I look forward to more of them on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nickvist in the lead of this cast well. I highly recommend this movie and its value 9.0 on scale 10.
