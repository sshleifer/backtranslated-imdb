I went to look for this film in a typical fan mania. I just wanted to check it out. I did not expect much from anything. After all, a musician, actor and scriptwriter? It is not possible for many talents to reside in one person. right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! Obsessed aside, soon became one of my favorites! Do not miss the line of story and characters in the typical Hollywood influences. The story spreads to your emotions and attracts you. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize that you have been pasted to the finish. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, it looks a bit more than the top. However, I think this is done by comedic intentions and very appropriate for personality. Otherwise, I did not expect the level of representation I saw. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or panting unexpectedly because of something I missed or forgot for the first or second time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film. Do not hesitate to enter your doubt, but I am sure he will find a place on the shelf.
