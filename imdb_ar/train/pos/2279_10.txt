Prior to that, the faulty "slaughterhouse" was the best. But this modification on the screen for "Mother of the Night" applies to the book and maintains the intentions of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, Hollywood was not a Hollywood of Champs, and was not a pariah in Hollywood. Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do with a five slaughterhouse). This may be true in Breakfast of Champions too, but they did a very bad job because you are better off reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film.
