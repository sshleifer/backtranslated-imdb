This is by far the most terrifying game I have ever played. This is not the average shooting rate for everything in a second (which I usually do not care much about); it is an acceptable gfx and interesting weapons, magic and brilliant surround sound effects ("Scryeeee and scryeeee ..") and above all the incredible atmosphere . I love the Scrye game that enables you in certain places of the games to see or hear the events that have occurred there in the past. The only game that I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of play was just because of the intense atmosphere. I am a fan of horror, especially with the stories and films of Cliff Parker, and participating in such a horror story makes me crave more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more engaging story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps, maybe the game was a bit short?)
