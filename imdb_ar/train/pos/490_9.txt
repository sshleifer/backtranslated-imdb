Mania comes in many flavors and exists for several reasons; for some it may not be more of a compulsive disorder, but for some others it may be a way to stay. The lack of care, coupled with the inability to negotiate even the most basic necessities of daily life or basic social requirements, can force a genius to embrace a zone of personal comfort. In extreme cases, the goal of this satisfaction may become a clear obsession, leading the individual to become what he began as a means of survival. He is the motivation behind his retreat. As we discover in Marlin's The Luzhin Defense, Gorris will not guarantee a high level of intelligence , A satisfactory solution to the problem, and may in fact aggravate the situation. Mania, it seems, has no bias or preference; moreover, it does not give any quarter. <br /> <br /> In an Italian resort in the 1920s, Alexander Lozien (John Tortoro) is one of the many who gathered there for the Chess Championship, which will be the winner of the World Champion. Lozin is the master of the game, but he is weak in the game of chess that has long ceased to be a game; instead, his obsession is that the only thing he discovered in his childhood is that he saw him despite his total incapacity in all areas of life apparently, And enabled him to overcome the hidden deprivation of his immediate family. So Luzhin is a genius with Achilles' heel, a flaw that only one person may know and understand. Moreover, it can be realized that it can be exploited for personal gain of his own in this particular tournament. This man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), the former Lozanne mentor, who suddenly returned after an absence of years to emerge and made him known to Loose. <br /> <br /> Valentinov is an unwelcome and disturbing presence for Lucienne. Once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a huge opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), who showed up in a previous tie after 14 hours, but is also trying to solve a new element in his life - his feelings towards a young woman he has just met at the resort, Natalia Watson). Although he is a genius, the dark clouds gather above him and may push Luzin to the depth of mania that was the salvation grace, as well as the curse of his whole life. <br /> <br /> To tell the story of Lozin, Gorris effectively uses memories of the past to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that quickly led to his obsession with chess. Since his background has been established, it provides insights that allow the public to fully understand who Luzhin is and how he has reached this point in his life. For his childhood scenes, Goris paints a darkly appropriate atmosphere and a sense of vow that extends into the most pastoral environment of the resort and puts it in place. The transformations that are woven through the past are handled with the present well, and as quickly as determined by the guris in presenting a presentation, but impetuous works very well. They also emphasize the danger resulting from Valentinov's presence, focusing on drama rather than thrill, which ultimately works to increase the overall impact of the film, making the tragedy of Luzhin more believable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The only element that makes this movie memorable is the impressive performance of John Tortoro. In order for this film to work, Luzhin must be very reasonable; it will be a disastrous moment or a catastrophic fiasco, as it will bring the viewer out of the story immediately. However, it does not happen, and the film works successfully, because Luzhin Turturro creates sincerity and sincerity in life. It embodies Lucien's genius, as well as his flaws, and presents his character in exceptional and very real terms. It's a performance equal, if not surpassed, by Jeffrey Rush to David Helfgott's "Shine". When comparing his work here with other characters he created, from Sid Lidz in "Unstrung Heroes" to Pete's "Hey Brother Where Are You?" To Al Fountain in "Box of Moonlight", you are aware of Turturro's incredible collection as an actor, and what a truly wonderful artist. <br /> <br /> As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, too, shift in a somewhat reserved performance through which she develops and introduces her character very well. Although they must be somewhat out of touch with Luzhin, the Watson managed to do so in a completely effective introspective manner. More importantly, because of the details it brings to its performance, it makes its fast relationship with Lozien believable and gives full credibility to the story. You just have to look into Watson's eyes to learn that the feelings conveyed by real. It is a wonderful work of talented and talented actor. <br /> <br /> Support team includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stasard), Peter Blyth (Elia), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Lozin's father), Kelly Hunter (Lucien's mother), Alexander Hunting ) And Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). "Luzhin Defense," a well-written and well-delivered film, is a passionate film. It was presented with a compassionate compassion that creates a sense of sadness and a person may think of his humanity. We do not need a film, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the cinema when we remember something we must never forget, as we all have the potential to make a positive change and change the lives of those around us. I rate this one 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
