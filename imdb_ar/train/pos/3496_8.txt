I am amazed at the number of people offering this step less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they do not understand the film. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around growth in difficult circumstances. <br /> <br /> There is a mad grandmother you really want your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> A good reason makes many critics love this movie. <br /> <br /> The reason is they understand the film. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the low results that some people have made. <br /> <br /> I wish I could write a short summary about a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Frankly I do not have anything else to say.
