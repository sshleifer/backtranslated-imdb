I liked this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it is very difficult to present the book as fully as it should, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they made a very good show with Nicholas Nickleby. I love Diana Reag and I can see Mrs. Diedluk's pain, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocratic class. I'm sorry, I think it's the best lady of the Didlock ... I'm not sure it could have been better than the Garendez, but I agree with Mr. Elliott. It's not easy to make these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist will be easier - this is long, and if you do not care about all legal positions it can be bleak or boring. I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. I just love Mr. Smallweed - it can be amusing. There is always a child - Joe will break your heart here ... I think you should be given an opportunity to judge ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I liked the show. Maybe if I read the book again, as I usually do, after watching the film, I may be more critical. In the meantime - I think it's a good show.
