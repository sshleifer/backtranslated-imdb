PERHAPS In an attempt to find another "hot property" for adaptation, the Fleischer brothers thought of returning to their very successful invasion of the Newspaper Comic Strip with their production of the Fleischer Studios / Paramount (1933). Although it was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B. did not show up for a short while; the rest was left as an experimental ring for the possible emergence of a whole series, <br /> <br /> As is now known, he became a brave sailor, And brawlin became the most successful animation series ever; there is no doubt that the reason for the experience of Fleischer and its studio literally and continue to this day. <br /> <br /> Returning to King Features To try again, the reason was undoubtedly the very famous HENRY Comic Strip experience at BETTY BOOP Picnic. The goal is the pursuit of another series. Thinking then seems definitely intact. HENRY was the most popular feature in the Hearst Papers collection. They appear as a daily supplement and on Sunday for comics, PUCK, weekly comedy. You know, "You idiots, these humans!" Remember this one, Schultz? In the show of the chubby boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his exotic screen, solo and in tandem with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well dealing with the character. Both the story and the director, Dave Fleischer, gave a great number of stylistic and film-like attitudes that seemed more appropriate to Henry's small character. These silent short essays were often very important for the animated film to keep up with the print page; HENRY was mostly done in a four-color "silent" type of acting. <br /> <br /> In the cartoon, BETTY BOOP with HENRY: THE FUNNIEST LIVING AMERICAN, (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what it is; it is one circumstantial exercise; interspersed with the usual set of shootings Dave Fleischer quick fire, gags like sprinklers. In short, Henry Grotta was discovered in the window of the Betty Boop's Pet Shop. It is a kind of love at first glance as Henry tries to buy the little puppy with the only money he had, for the coins in his pocket. It is in the form of by Miss Bob that it would be $ 2.00 in the era of depression to make the purchase. The tears appear as the little man leaves in a state of depression. <br /> <br /> But there is a break on the horizon soon when my house asks the boy to mind the store, while urgent work is leaving. In return for his services, Miss Betty promised him the little dog in return. Of course, they have a deal and my house papers. <br /> <br /> Getting the work of cleaning cages and feeding livestock gives Fleischer's team a chance to launch a whole series of gags; this time featuring bird seeds, Pat Henry bald and push brooms. (But not all this, of course, Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the bird population in the store by literally laying his head at first would lead to a collective defection of birds; outside the store to the open street in a collective prison break. <br /> <br /> Betty returns to this scene and expresses her disappointment and anger over Henry's temporary care. All bets were extinguished, no dog for Henry. He begins to leave; But he soon persuaded the owner to give him another chance to fix things. His head is covered with bird seeds, and he manages all the small feathers; he returns them to the pet shop. Fortunately, the foliage is small. But this time he had his own puppy, small, licking his face. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt this was a winning combination. Our carefree, energy-filled, free wheel for the boy, the kindness of my house and the emotions of the situation and the dubious results in the development of "boy and dog." Max and Dave Fleischer gave us a kind of almost minor mini-masterpiece for a short surreal comedy. <br /> <br /> We were quite surprised not to follow the HENRY series. If we judge through the sincere treatment of personality, it is certain that it could have lasted for some time. Anyway, this team was in many ways the best experience for Betty Boop. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and hardly had any Betty Boop in it, except for a veil in the role of a dancer around the carnival); The HENRY Short was much better than my King Features experience, The BETTY BOOP, the Little King, BETTY BOOP and LITTLE JIMMY, both in 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
