12-year-old Arnold Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are captured by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or feel that he is not the right thing to do). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have mercy on him. Realism will captivate "living" movie lovers, but it will not satisfy those who want to move and thrill.
