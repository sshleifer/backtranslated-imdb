This was the first film "Walking Tall" that I've seen, and I think it's in a two-dollar movie theater along the Hollywood Blvd. , So I had no indication of the first batch of Joe Don Becker. I remember being shocked by the corrupt regime in McNare County and the brutality of the "backward gangs". I was also amazed by the fact that a man decided he would not let her slip, and went out to do something about it. brave? I thought about it - to the extent that shivers were sent from the spine. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a wonderful story about the American courage to stand up and do something about a system that serves its own interest only. I've been blown away on this subject, and I think this is still one of the best genre hero / anti-hero movies, which may laugh at one but it includes modern films such as "The Punisher", but more so because it's a true story. A recent remake of the starring "The Rock" does not do justice to the real fire in the story of Buford Bowser. <br /> <br /> "Classic" which I'm sure will reappear in the future.
