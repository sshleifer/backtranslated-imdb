Titanic is a long, but well-made, tragic love story during the ill-fated journey aboard the unmanned ship. The filmmaker James Cameron has done a great job in producing this film about a fantasy love story between two very different people and combining it with the real Titanic event that sank after colliding with an iceberg on April 15, 1912, killing thousands of people in the Arctic Ocean Atlantic. Both films play a great part in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good couple on the screen. DeParillo and Winslet also had real chemistry together, making the romance that eventually flourishes more believable. Both showed real talent when this one appeared and both continued to show it in their latest films as well. The rest of the support team including Billy Zane, Cathy Bates, Francis Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a role as small and equally impressive as their characters who help bring life back to this film. The story of love, movement, suspense, and wonderful special effects are made especially at that time. I felt the horror that the characters felt was very real because it really happened, which made you want most of them to survive this state of life and death. The speed was a little slow at times and was a bit long but the rest of the film compensated for its few drawbacks. Titanic is making a certain historical film that makes some girls cry every time they watch. The fact that this has already happened is certainly added to the film which makes you feel sorry for all the lost spirits when Titanic sank into the Atlantic Ocean after striking an iceberg. Overall the Titanic is a tragic tragic story about two people falling in love while they were on the ominous ship that brought to life through the extraordinary performances of the cast and especially DiCaprio and Winslet who made this movie definitely worth the time to watch it.
