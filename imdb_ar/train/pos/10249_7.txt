This is the first series of the Guinea Pig series, one of the most notorious films out of the group. <br /> <br /> It took a long time to wake up finally and put my hand on a copy of this notorious collection of movies. I bought a Pig Pig Guinea box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date. So this sucker appeared and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the Internet, and realized the content contained in this film, I was expecting to experience my nerves completely. It ended up not being so. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin to torture her in the hope of discovering the point of human collapse, and how long a person can endure the pain. <br /> <br /> Looks like a flick one patient is not it? Error. The film failed to shock. This may be because I have become obsessed over the years by my obsession, but I think it is safe to say that any real wound can easily bear this. <br /> <br /> On the other hand a person who does not have a good knowledge of this kind of movies is likely to be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Although it fails to shock me, the film has some beautiful and violent scenes of violence. Including tearing the nails and intestines that were thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle across the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that for the majority of the wound on this painting, you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any newcomer to this kind of film, Your way to this movie.
