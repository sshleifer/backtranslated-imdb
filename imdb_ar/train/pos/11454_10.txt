Being a fan of Andy Goldsworth for a while now, and having some of his books, I had some expectations about what I would see. What I got was quite satisfactory and much more than I expected. Being an artist (working in clay), finding inspiration in our surroundings to make good art is essential, something Andy Golsworthy has mastered. Over the course of a year, the director captures the automatic energy, skill and dedication of artist contact with nature with inspiring taste. The music that is tuned to the movie hugs and poisons. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or anyone else who needs a good experience, look for this film. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere. Create, dance and wrestle with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
