Romance of the film, which is also its main theme, good and well presented. However, the surrounding love story is very lyrical, graphical and unrealistic. Worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the film. Feel free to watch this movie, if you attract your attention, but do not expect too much of it.
