FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film of the golden age of SF Cinema and what makes it a wonderful movie is its admirable feeling. As soon as the spaceship lands, the audience - through the crew of human ships - moves through a sometimes terrifying and terrifying adventure. We meet with the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morpheus, and his beautiful and innocent daughter Alter and recognize the former inhabitants of the planet - the Krill who died overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> You can tell the story that the planet was clearly filmed in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but that adds to the sense of stinging phobia I feel. Bebe and Louis Barron add more air. <br /> < I was shocked because this film is not among the top 250 films for IMDB.
