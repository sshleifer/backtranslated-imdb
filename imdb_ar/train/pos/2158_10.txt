I do not like "class inflation" but I had to give that number 10. I can not think of anything I did not like about it. I saw her last night and woke up thinking about her today. I'm sure that the new version of Hollywood that someone told me, with J Lo and Richard Gere, would be excellent, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was very emotional and stimulating for me to think that I was too compressed to think in any way that could be improved, Prepare them for a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story found to be worth watching, and with sights or rifles fighting the fist explode or anything like that! imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed sophisticated, ... even the non-core characters had a good personal development and a pleasant representation, and the choice seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good musical in our time and age, and maybe this is not quite qualified (there's a lot of dance learning, but not singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and the others who defended a place to dance in Our lives were thought a lot in this film and the role of dancing in helping to tell the story of a middle-aged man, succeeding with a family in Japan, looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> To a team of people in Japan who have contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.
