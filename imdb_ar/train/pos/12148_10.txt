This film contains a lot of comedy, not dark, and glows Gordon Liu in this film. He displays his comedic side and it was really strange to see him defeated. His "unconventional" training, who thought the knot could be deadly? Lots of great stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang into the mix and you'll get a great final match! Do not mess with the Manchu thugs. They are ruthless!
