Damn, I've watched this movie for at least 4 times and still do not feel bored to see it. <br /> <br /> The pictures are very good and with great music and quite appropriate this movie is amazing to me. <br /> <br /> The IMHO CGIs are very bad, but the full pictures with a black and white feeling around it and the interior designs were completely sterile ... just a perfect genius just a mix for such a movie. The whole feeling about this feeling can not be described. The plot is very good. <br /> <br /> Although the film had minor flaws, such as: Sometimes I thought the film was a bit slow, but I did not mean the scenic parts, I loved those things perfectly. <br /> <br /> As you are often distracted from a completely complex story, like when in something like an underground cellar of digicorps, where all their data is saved, this conversation with the guy down there ... But this may also be me: D, it was possible to display the end one way or another was further emphasized that it was supposed to make the back of the memory true for a little longer and "louder", but again without all these flaws, The film was very good and I did not stop watching it over and over.
