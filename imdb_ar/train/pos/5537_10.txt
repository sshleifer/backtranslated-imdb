Maybe this was not as good as a whole, but the second episode, which I was the first to say, was quite memorable and I still remember it today. Become a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in racing horses and puzzles. <br /> <br /> The slang of my friend, Chico Barnes, is much more entertaining for those of us who never came close to hearing Bow in London bells, but the threads were attractive and the presentations were interesting. <br /> <br /> Mr. Halley was one of Francis's most interesting personalities, and the offer actually reduces some difficulties in his hand. Interestingly, electronic hands of the type used in the stories seem less functional to the user than the kind invented after World War II.
