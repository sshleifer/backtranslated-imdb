If Arthur Askay's mind is wrapped in your grief, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, like the wonderful Back Room Boy, it's a very cool movie to be drowned by one person performing, even the lead actor. Personally, I love Askey, perhaps because I am going to his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him, a mistake made by many people. The Ghost Train is so intense that you can not watch it without being surprised by the dark, deep world it takes you. It is so immersive that a few of the cheap and cheerful spectra can survive early in the 1940s. Only a few people only once. The cast, without exception, is very good, and Linden Travers might put it in a rather thick position, but against a single wartime railroad station, she could barely play the note and not stand out. The granorous sadness of lovely Carol Lane broke earlier this year the last episode we had with this stunning film and now it is really in the past, but we patiently wait to press us.
