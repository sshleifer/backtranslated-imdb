I have read countless posts about this game very similar to Max Payne, when I was playing it for the first time I thought it was a weird little arcade-like game with the desire to rip Max Payne's style (not just a bullet) - time). So when I played for two hours I realized how enjoyable it was! How different from "Max Payne", yes, the time of the bullet is somewhat similar, but I think it fits differently with the style of the game. This game is a never-ending movement - a combination of shootings, battles, and a lot of fun, as a great fan of Max Payne, I must say that the DTR story is not close to Max Payne's grandeur, the graphics are a bit mediocre and some levels look like they are, But if you want more of this "lead period", you should definitely own this game.
