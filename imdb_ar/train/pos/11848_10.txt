Well, what can I say, this film really got me, not so bad, as many say, I really liked it, although the idea seems very simple, rather boring, is not. First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Brian Adams), she agrees with the film. Second, the simple story and the drama of the soul are of your interest. The most thing I like is that they did not give the human voice a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the film more realistic, and does not appear that many of the animation looks realistic now? , But ... I do not know that making animals speak is just ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, recommend it to everyone, not just children :), because it is very relaxing.
