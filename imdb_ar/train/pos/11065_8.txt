This comedy, which carries a lot of pain and sadness, succeeds in the failure of most others. There were many films of this kind with eminent actors trying to achieve this elusive combination that did not come anywhere near the depth of that taste and ingenuity. This is certainly because actors Reg Rogers and Eli Chidi are outstanding performers, making their characters really quickly grab your attention and emotions and keep them throughout the film. At first, the procedure seems out of sight and loved, but gradually one learns that these two patheticly affected people are desperately trying to heal themselves, even reluctantly, through each other. Rogers' sincere expressions of numbness and angry Shady's exuberance are so eloquent that one feels as one notices. You will take care of these two beloved people but suffer from great suffering and hope to succeed because they are in doubt and hang everyone on a weak emotional thread. We hope viewers will be able to see more Reg Regers and Ally Sheedy because this film proves their importance as highly distinguished actors.
