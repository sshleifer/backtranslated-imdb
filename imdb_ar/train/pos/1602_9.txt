I bought the video a bit late in my collection and maybe I would save a lot of money if I bought it previously. It always replaces anything else in Cosmo Moon nights. Sure, Cher and Olympia deserve their awards, but this is a stunning performance from a great screenplay. What? You do not know what is "cosmo moon"?
