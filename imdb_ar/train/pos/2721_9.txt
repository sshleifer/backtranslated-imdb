The real story (signed in Kansas in 1959) about the murder (Perry and Dick, two former convicts who stormed a faraway house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks wrote Kabot's disturbing and disturbing book about the reasons that led these children to crime (are they natural born killers?). The scenes of the crime are extremely brutal and painful because of the lack of senses and the reasons we have seen. A stunning Black and White film by Conrad Hall, excellent Country Music by Quincy Jones, stunning performances in key roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and for the first time in a sad film about the death penalty at the last minute before their death. Jones, Hale and Brooks (as director and scriptwriter) are Oscar nominees. Sweeping and producing it in a wonderful and frightening way, one of the best films of this decade
