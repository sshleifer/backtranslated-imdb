No other film made me feel this before ... I do not feel bad. Like, I do not want to refund my money or the time I waited to watch this movie (9 months) and I do not feel bad about using two hours of sunny summer days to view this ______. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how hard my mind is, I do not seem to get a word in any of the seven languages ​​that the film had to summarize. I had no idea what was going on all the time and half way through the movie I needed a break. No movies have ever written before. I never wanted to get cauliflower, French milk and bread. thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Ah * Clear throat * No words. No ideas. I do not know, I do not know. I really do not know. - Kate
