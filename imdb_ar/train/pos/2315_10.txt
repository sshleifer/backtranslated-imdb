There is so much value in this film that it is hard to know where to begin to praise. Let me begin by admiring the ideal portrayal of Reese Witherspoon. That its outstanding performance in the excellent cast is already commendable. Robert Mulligan rarely disappointed us who were impressed with his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is a guide to making films at their best.
