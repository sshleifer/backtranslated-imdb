Reflections: pure joy from beginning to end. Not a laughing riot, but a more accurate sense of humor. Yala is a gold mine of magnificent sights and prominent actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Baiva, Ian Wolf, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Father. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant in the scene of building his new home, which is at that stage, is being framed. A young carpenter, played in the future by Tarzan Lakes Parker, asks him if he wants to "tell" his liras, or something like that only a carpenter knows, giving, not wanting to appear ignorant, and responding in the affirmative. "Well boys, rabbits want, so ... laughs!" Secondly, you hear the sounds of tearing up and tearing about 20 of the large nails that are pulled out of different plates ... All you can do is whine. <br /> <br /> You have never seen that many carpenters working in a single family home, such a place, in Connecticut in all places, may run a few million Dollars. <br /> <br /> Classic movie is really a treasure.
