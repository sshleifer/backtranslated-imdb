Six degrees I had a drug addict. I was looking forward to it and was very disappointed when I replaced the Men in the Trees at the right time. I thought it was just a stop and will be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it was over. We can deal with characters that have real problems. We talked about each episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one in the show I did not like and I felt that the acting was fantastic. I always like watching recorded programs in cities where you can select local areas. I would like someone to protest against canceling this offer and ask you to return it and give it another chance. Give it a good time, and do not continue to move it from that day to that day and announce it until people know it is on.
