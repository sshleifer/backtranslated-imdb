This film is proof that the Noir movie is a permanent style and deserves to survive too. For me, it's the best example of Noar since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he will not get the recognition he deserves. It was never promoted correctly when it was first released and had to build a cadre of fans through places such as Vanguard Cinema and referrals. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that people look for something more than just not paying attention to this movie's entertainment and digging into a very crooked plot.
