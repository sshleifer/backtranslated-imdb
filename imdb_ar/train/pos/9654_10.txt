Stephan Ridou was already a star of the Tour de Force in Wild Reeds, one of France's biggest independent stars. In this film, he plays the role of Cedric, a local boy who meets Matthew (newcomer Jimmy Kaim, with a stunning, delicate, ethereal performance) on the beach. Mathieu has a complicated relationship with his sick mother, demanding his aunt and sister (who has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two fall in love. <br /> <br /> The story of the broken film - consisting of long protracted appearances, bits and pieces of the present, and real-time progress to the future - is a bit daunting. Director Sebastian Lefitz does not refer to the period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to follow the story line. But you have to stick to it: there's a final 45 minutes for the movie, so you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. This film, which turns into a heart and lift, turns into a "beautiful thing" as a movie worth seeing.
