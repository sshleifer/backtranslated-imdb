Once in life means that once he is a leader, he is always a leader, and no one enters or exits "life" for free. New York neighborhoods sell drugs and run fraud because they can not manufacture them in the legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they are lazy. This simple story with two transitions about mostly despicable characters has managed to draw the sympathy of the public to the core players because of their loyalty and sympathy with each other. The film is directed and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also starred in the name 20/20 Mike (all nicknames with titles), based on his play "Riff Raff". It looks like a play from start to finish, especially during the longest scene where the three main players compete to determine who can be trusted. The dialog box often comes very quickly and much faster than on the stage, and I think it's the biggest drawback in the film. The memories of the past all over the film combine poems from the street, a sort of pentagram rap, which is violent and exciting to the world that this film is revealing. Hair makes it difficult to exclude these men, these killers who kill, deceive, and betray each other, do not deserve our attention or less than our disdain. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer from the same reasons we all experience. One is very stupid, one is addicted, and the other suffers from conscience while the public wonders, or even laughs, at the irony of the torturers who ask him to hang in the gallows to tell the jokes amid his demise.
