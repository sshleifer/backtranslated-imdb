I first passed on LoG by mistake one night during a TV crack: since then, I have not missed a loop. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange hilarity, such as the intersection between Brass Brass's social commentary, the excellent single-roof Fast Show show, and an amazing layout that seems to evolve every week without going anywhere. The best example of this is Hilary Bryce's own things - what was going on around him? <br /> <br /> You will not like humor for everyone. Some will say that it is very sick, and it is easy to know where they came from. However, try it out. If you do not like it, do not watch it, but if you like it, you'll be very happy because you've been advised.
