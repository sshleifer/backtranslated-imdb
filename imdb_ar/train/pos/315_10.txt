I love this soap perfectly. I have been one of my favorites. I would highly recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soap, they deal with real life events. I'm really sad because the soap is over but I'm sure I'll be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters and the plot and how things finally turned out to the bad guys. The only thing I would like to change is the end of a check and her long love. I can not wait to see it again and we highly recommend it. Check was by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you all like it too.
