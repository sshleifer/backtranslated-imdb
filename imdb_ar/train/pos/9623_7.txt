Hmmmmm, you want a little romance with your mystery? This is his. I think that if romance is abandoned, this would lead to a better film. But how romantic can be abandoned when the story is borrowed from something called romance novel Harlequin, whatever it is. If romance had been abandoned, the story would have been too weak. The puzzle here was not so bad, and very interesting, but nothing at the level of international espionage for the impossible mission. Oh, okay. I thought Mill Harris was good; I think her short skirts added some sexual attraction. But this guy from Rob Stewart could have been better, perhaps with a famous television actor. The orientation was decent and typing was possible - it could have been both a bit more darker and more adventurous. One thing that was wonderful about this was the use of real European sites. It was possible to change that easily, so it was possible to photograph this in Canada, but they were really in great places like Budapest. Perhaps the disadvantage was choosing the director and / or cinematographer to frame some of the perfect postcard photo shots. not good. If this is the most dramatic animation of the big screen, the ideal postcard viewer really needs a back seat and is a nice part of the background. This was just a TV movie, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some of those Ummmph came from the scene. Overall, the film was not really bad. I'll tell you, this was the best Hungarian CAD production I've ever seen! (And the only one I know.) I hereby declare to be a modest film dedicated to television, giving it a C degree
