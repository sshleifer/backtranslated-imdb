I was recommended by White Fire by a man owned by two separate DVD versions and on VHS. He claimed to be one of the coolest and finest budget makers ever made. I generally do not watch movies and they realize they will be bad, but I excluded this one ... I was very happy because I did it. <br /> <br /> It is full to the end of the movement (many of them amazingly, always graphically), corruption (isolated to nudity with a main female figure, but there is much of it in one scene becomes a joy) and a very strange dialogue, To laugh to stimulate the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Jenny, the unusual star looking for the pesticide (and countless other low-budget action tricks) is a fun game, offering the best performance he can get. Williamson is better than usual, obviously it hinders it with unparalleled joy (which only comes halfway). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the bad guys, one of them is a sadist who speaks with a dialect and seems to be a mix of Spanish and Italian. It is priceless. <br /> <br /> Once again, I can not stress enough how strong it is. It is not so bloody as to be nausea, but it is unusually violent in some parts where some snails launch in a shootout and have a cruel sequence of torture that no one will ever forget. Also, when Jenny is jammed by a group of bad guys, he gets comfortably on a chainsaw and the next moments will greet all the thrillers chanting and drinking beer. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the white fire. It is a lively game - if it is stupid in its mind - the classic movement.
