As a German mother and an English father (he spent five years in a prisoner-of-war camp) I came from a unique location. One of having to deal with various Nazis on one side of the family and victors of World War II on the other. These small games can not delve deeper into every part of Hitler's psyche and the viewer must be given a general flavor of the attitude at that time and the best one can feel. In this series well. Carlyle is very good like Otol, however I would like to have more information about relations with others in the party because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him who followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later in his fatal career. What was going on in Goebbels, Goring and Hess? It was useful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it makes people look at it more. This may also make people understand why a person like Saddam Hussein is not allowed to continue in power.
