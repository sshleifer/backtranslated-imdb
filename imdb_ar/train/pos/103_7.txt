When I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli were filmed; good enough ... <br /> <br /> The film, very intelligent and interesting Because, cast a lot of European actor and actress especially international such as from Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> Second, the story is fundamental and you can guess, but if you represent fun in the game, > <br /> Third, the last chapter is not special or interesting, it is as regular as other motion films. <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... and I hope you enjoy it: d
