I saw the reunion of McQuez and was happy to see Richard Crane, Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now was great, because I was always watching this show grow up so when the TV said that there would be a reunion was very excited! The only thing I could not discover was why Lydia Reed (Hasey McCoy) and Michael Winkleman (Little Luke) were there. I know Walter Brennan is dead. So I got my computer and tried to identify them and found this site, so if anyone could tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hasey McCoy) and Michael Winkleman (Little Luke I would be grateful !! I looked everywhere and luck. What I knew about Michael Winkleman was that he was supposed to be born in 1946. This offer had the value and ethics of every lesson he had to learn.Today offers do not have this All the actors were unbelievable and the only thing better to discover is to meet him, so Since this is impossible if there is anyone who can help, please do !!!
