David Lynch's strange film describes "a truly beautiful and moral story of brotherly love." This was especially "strange" because it was not the kind of film Lynch had shown in the past 15-20 years. These were dark and amazing films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know that many fans are disappointed with it. Others were pleased with it. Think of me as one of those recent films, and I own all three "dark" movies as well. <br /> <br /> This was another supposed life story, detailing the journey of an elderly man on a lawn mower from western Iowa to Wisconsin to see his sick brother who had not spoken to him for years but wanted to see before his death. Well, I guess this hypothesis - an old man driving a grass mower 400 miles away - still makes this movie "strange" of some kind, so Lynch stays that way! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays starring. He is the kind of man, wise, wise, the figure of the wise, who loves everyone. The wrinkles on his face tell a story. It was very sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after the screening of this film. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this film is not great, and is not always nice because it shows the main personal part of the adult and mentally disabled child (Cisse Spacek) and its tragic past, but once Alvin Street begins his journey, the story picks up. I played this with many friends and thought that the movie was never picked up, but I was more generous with it. I think it is a hidden gem. For them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found his journey fascinating, but you have to realize in advance that this will not be the story of Lynch's suspicious crime. It's slow and if you're fine with you, you might want to. The charm enters the picture in some of the people Alvin meets along the way, like a young escaping girl and some nice city residents who help the old man out when he faces a problem. (Henry Kada on behalf of Daniel Ryordan, is the most prominent in this regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third bills, but this is a joke: it's only in the last few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Nice Iowa scene, I've lived There for several years I can witness the dusty hills and rich soil, it's a nice situation with nice people like this movie.
