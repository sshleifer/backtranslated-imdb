New York I love you full of love and strength. However, not everyone, but it is a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> It contains the likes of Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and many others) Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and many more. Through the cast of stars, this film is undoubtedly wonderful, <br /> <br /> from many top filmmakers around the world, does not fail to influence. Diversity from story to story is unique and creative. <br /> <br /> It is safe to say that New York I Love You is a popcorn movie, and you should watch it on BIG TV! This time, I trust the IMDb rating, because it is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Waiting for Shanghai I Love You to wait in 2010. <br /> <br /> See NY ILY, you will not be disappointed.
