I'm really surprised that this movie did not get a higher rating on IMDB. It's one of those movies that can easily be acquired by someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is in fact a category. It is a place and an ethnic charm that people seem to take for granted. Casting alone makes it an almost perfect film. Some of the films in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" which is very funny. **** Away from the place *****
