I stumbled across this (Act-I) with a pure stupid moment and this was more than a decade ago. This was not what the envelope on the tape said. you amazed me. You have terrorized me. you shocked me. I finally forgot and after almost a decade, I come across it again. Then he went and bought both deeds. It was better than I had at first. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while tanks continue to fight with crime, supplying tanks and heavy artillery, it seems as if they are having a difficult time with criminals. This has either never been shown or simply a lie because it seems to be easier most of the time. If this thing about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly did not appear that way. <br /> <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could have been anywhere as good as the Americans version of this. But with regard to the story, certain correct interpretations of the translation have certainly been lost, but they can be excused.
