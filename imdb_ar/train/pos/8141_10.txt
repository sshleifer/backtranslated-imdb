I picked up the film without a cover and did not even know what it was, but when I saw it I laughed hard. It is now one of my favorite films of all time. Rust and men create a masterpiece I would strongly recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us something to laugh at.
