Maslin Beach is a nude / natural beach in southern Adelaide, on the Fleurieu Peninsula, in South Australia. It is also the name of an Australian film that uses the beach as a location. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is called a romantic comedy. This may be a little misleading, because it is not a film "Farhana", nor is it romantic in the traditional sense, but has lukewarm moments. As far as life itself, there are also moments of sadness as well. It is also fully filmed on the beach of nudes mentioned above, and nudity is played throughout the film. The viewer quickly learns to accept this as usual, focusing on the plot, not on the copious amount of meat. <br /> <br /> Simon and Marcy (Michael Allen and Eliza Lovell) arrive by car on the beach side of a park. They take their belongings to the beach, and as they walk, Simon's voice speaks of confusion about what true love is. The rest of the film is explored for this, framed in a full day on the beach. The basic story is what happens to Simon's loving life, but there are also many other characters that have been highlighted in many separate short essays. <br /> <br /> When they reach the beach, both Simon and Marcie seem bored with each other. They are seen as a romantic couple by Romeo and Juliet. Simon is just bored with everything. After that, we met Gail (Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence), Zara Collins and Jennifer Ross. They walk on the beach together to discuss the opportunities of a generation to find the "ideal" man, with the help of the "powers" of the necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother. However, there are many more interesting people on the beach, not all of them "catchy" and young (part of the realism of this film). <br /> <br /> To serve beach goers, there is a simple and short service ice cream salesman with a car. This is Ben (Gary Wadele), a friend of Simon, who is also his informal adviser. I think this character is the main comic element. It's hard to say, because there's nothing about Ben that would make you laugh out loud, unless you're drunk, male and very young! Maslin Beach has a major recovery feature, although it does not remain long in any subject. Because the quality of the representation is mixed, the scenario is questionable and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap, and the lack of continuity is a positive blessing. In fact, there is something about this film (not nudity) I find attractive. It is difficult to define what it is, but it can be rude, and Aussie's frank attitude toward physical matters. <br /> <br /> The camera works in Maslyn Beach. Sometimes it is very good, with some stunning stills and "pans" on the beach, cliffs and sunset. Because nudity is a key factor in this film, framing is an important aspect of camera action. There is no feeling of satisfaction in the frame, which means that the frame is so that the camera does not touch the "special" body parts. This helps to relieve any discomfort of the viewer from within the "personal space" of the subject and makes the film more tasteful. Not an easy task, given the location of photography. <br /> <br /> Maslyn Beach is not a "flick of the skin" for males after puberty, testosterone-laden males, or the popular Meles & Bohn romance for highly valued women. Maslin Beach does not seem to fit anywhere in the genre. The actors are not "catchy" in the sense of Baywatch, and they are just "normal" people you see on the beach anywhere. She does not have a message to make and will not even work as a tourist ad, unlike perhaps for natural scientists. Apart from the Australian dialect, photography in any country can be sunny. What makes this film Australia clear is the fact that it is useless (real cinema?), And only Australian cinema, and other medium sized national cinemas, can consider such a reckless choice. At the same time, these medium-sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the search for identity, and "flipping" will not damage its reputation too much. It is always possible, as Maslin Beach is now a collector, and the film may become popular internationally, but it is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> During this criticism, I was looking very negative, sometimes around Maslyn Beach. This is not the real attitude, since I found the movie very easy to watch it. I enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people (and problems). The problems faced by the film are those that occur every day, and a bit in the scene. This does not hurt in my opinion, and I hope that more films will deal with such a day. There is a connection here with cinemas in Europe, and French cinema in particular. They rarely deal with disasters or major disasters, but with daily life. Hollywood directly interferes with this, and stands at the top of the wave of drama / realism. The pace is also much faster in Hollywood, but it is not a reality. Maslin Beach is not exactly "Jacques Tati," but it is on the right track, even if it ignores issues of cultural pluralism, equality, gender orientation, etc., which are of great importance in current cinema. I'm sure you'll love or hate this movie, with a small space to compromise. <br /> <br />
