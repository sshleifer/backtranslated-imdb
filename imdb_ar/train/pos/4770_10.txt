The only show I've seen since 90210! Why did they stop? This was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like a part of everything! The least they have to do is release it to DVD! <br /> <br /> I've reviewed similar offers, but nothing is close. The cast was incredible chemistry and I look forward to each episode with a lot of anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by dragging this offer. If anyone has any information about where I can get a DVD from North Shore, please post a few lines here Thanks! Aloha!
