I do not know how or why this film has a lean rating on IMDb. This film with "I'm Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed you think this movie is that if you do not like the film process, do not like psychology or if you expect bumped hardcore porn. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you will not want to see; it's a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** summaries, may contain a spoiler or two ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing in this film is that it mixes the entire movie inside a movie What, but he does so in a way that sometimes forgets that fantasy is not real. <br /> <br /> The film looks like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A documentary film political, the social system in Sweden at the time. Which in many ways are still relevant today. Interviews conducted by a young woman named Lina. <br /> <br /> 2. a story about a film director, Vilgot Sjoman, which makes a film ... It deals with the relationship with his star in the film, and how was it should not get involved with people who are supposed to work with them. <br /> <br /> 3. The film made by Vilgot. It is about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), a young and politically active too, which is doing a documentary film (IE. # 1.). It is also in the age of majority and in her sexuality, and freedom of it. <br /> <br /> The magnificence and glamor of "I'm curious: yellow / blue" is how these three elements are divided together. At one point you see an interview about politics, and next time you watch what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but it is so good that you sometimes forget it narration. <br /> <br /> The dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", which if you see one, you should see the other. "Blue" is not a supplement at all. I will try to explain it as best I can because, to my knowledge, no other films have done so, although it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "yellow" as a living thing, real events in 14 scenes. Full story. <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" like all the things among the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you have not seen, a whole story on its own. <br /> <br /> They are essentially parallel films ... The same story, is listed in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I completely understood "yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this is useful for people who are not encouraged by different influences, because this film is not The way I looked at the film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
