After I heard very positive comments and after seeing the trailer I had to see this movie. With William H. Messi, Louis Guzman, Michael Gitter and Sam Rockwell, must be good. And delivered. In general, the film is not funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is in my view a classic. The spoiler in the end, where they break through the wall to get to a safe place and see staring at Rockwell and Washington at Jeter is wonderful. This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude uses a chair to tie his door, but forgets that the door turns out! END SPOILER Go to watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
