I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best films of "National Lampoon's", and it contains a very charming parody title, which basically summarizes what the whole movie is about .... Men In White !!!! The story is a spoof of many films including Will Smith, as I had guessed, "Men in Black." I will not give the finish away, but its end is very good (Leslie Nielsen's humor) from start to finish, especially the thing near the beginning when your on the street collects trash cans. Also, they have a wonderful dump truck (garbage truck) in this scene as well. Acting is not great, in fact, it's not good, but that's what makes the film funny, it's comedy, it's mitigated !! I like the story line, partly because it was brought in somewhat and partly because it is interesting to see how it (or should be inaccurate) spoils all other films. I'm very fond of non-serious parody movies, but I'm also impressed by the real thing. With these films, it's hard to determine which is better, the film that's essentially torn (previously mentioned) or the actual film is, but also when you're actually spoofing comedy , It makes it really more difficult, but this movie is successfully executed. The garbage guys are very funny, reminds me of a UK TV show called "Little Britain". This movie is necessary for your group, which is one of the best and most entertaining movies, entertainment and best story, National Lampoon movie so far !!
