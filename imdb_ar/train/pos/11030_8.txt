Watching Cliffhanger makes me feel nostalgic for the early 1990s, when almost all new motion movies can be described as "Die Hard in a / on." Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a Mountain", which is very good, for what it is. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which is a hard-pressed Die Hard, Cliffhanger deals with the closed sense of many motion movies and embraces stunning landscapes that threaten to overcome the struggles of people who fight and die Between the peaks and threatening them. <br /> <br /> Years before other films such as Simple Plan and Fargo raised crime and murder at snowfall locations, Cliffhanger director Rene Harlin realized the visual effect to avoid brutal violence and dark conflicts in order to survive against the cold natural environment and indifference. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received a lot of praise, all it deserves: Its intensity allows us to forget camera trick and actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening. Not even the Harlin Cat's Falling Animal, which is vigorously powerful but still threatens to become more than a joke (repeated in the depths of the blue sea), or the funny expression of Ralph White's face, can reduce the power of sequencing. <br /> <br /> The next amazing set is the battle of shooting and theft on board. As Stallone and Michael France wrote and directed by Harlin, immersed the public in the work by not knowing initially which of the clients involved in the robbery and who are not: the double blood crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert noted, the imitator who carried out the airlift between the planes deserves some special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, it appears that one of the terrorists / thieves has already fallen off the snow wall carrying him down the mountain. To my knowledge, no one was killed in making this film (a small miracle, given the extreme nature of some stunts), so it is clear that a puppet was used for photography. But the snapshot itself remains impressive because we left wondering how Harleen (or probably one of the directors of the second unit) knew exactly where to put the camera. <br /> <br /> I will have Sly Stallone as the hero of the movement on any given day of the week, because it is one of the few movie stars I have ever seen who convinced them that he can suffer a lot of physical and emotional pain while feeling this pain . The role of Gabe Walker actually complements Stallone's strengths: he plays an older and more fragile role in the movement, delivering an incredibly low performance as a mountain rescuer who must recover himself. <br /> <br /> Many comics heroes inspired by the post-matrix writers, Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any supernatural abilities or improved computer. In Kleefhanger, the hero froze to death, and his clothes began to appear great tears because he barely escapes from dangerous position after another. He wins when he hits and bleeds when he cuts, especially in the sequence of the cave when he takes a rocky way flowing from one of the mad villains. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that the bad guys are very mean. Really contributed to the effectiveness of the film: When I first saw this movie when I was a teenager, I was rooting with the good guys every step of the way and I expected when another bad guy would get some dust ( Or, rather, ice); at one point, she was already hailed as one of the coldest characters in the film who had deserved a violent demise. <br /> <br /> The British Leithgo dialect was not as persuasive as the typical model airplane or model helicopter, but he was basically a good actor, and one of the few who could read the absurd dialogue: In one scene, they see his hostages Stallone and Rucker , Trying to determine the tasks that gave them, actually says "You, stay! You, bring!" Even the best actor, like Anthony Hopkins, may have had a problem with this line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffanger sometimes hides credibility, he does it only for a more entertaining show. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, for example, he says to openly appeal to one of his men, "quit Stallone when he comes down." No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: the negligence allowed for Rooker to issue a warning to Sly on the rocky face, this leads to a tug of war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to drag him down by the rope tied to his leg . <br /> <br /> Lithgow had given it more precisely, but the sequence may not have been too interesting to see if Rooker did not give the opportunity to open up to challenge his arrogance. <br /> <br /> Much ended up in the style of Saturday or West series (sometimes), Cliffhanger was designed on a solid basis to escape some of the weak elements that would have undermined a less important film. <br /> <br /> Along with the obvious airplane models we mentioned earlier, the weak moments include a few scenes filmed on cheap indoor sets with truly fake snow, as well as two other scenes that include bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in narrative Already packed. Finally, Harleyn's decision to shoot some slow-moving death scenes seems futile, because this technique does not contribute anything to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Stallone has become too old for Motion Pictures, because his character in this film seems so credible that I certainly wonder what it will be like years later. But Cliffhanger may be better off alone all the time, without a complement: there are already enough old and tired film franchises. There was an informal supplement called Vertical Limit: Compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger belongs to the IMDb list for the top 250 sites. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially given most other Stallone movies.)
