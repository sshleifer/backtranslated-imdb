I did not really know what to expect when going out to watch a movie, apart from the basic surrealist plot ordered by a single Russian bride online. That was Nicole Kidman in it. I loved the movie perfectly and came out of the "wow" thinking. <br /> <br /> Again and again on the ground, the movie moves well, with some surprises in every corner. The relationships in the film are believable, with Nicole and Chaplin working beautifully against each other. Humor is wonderful, with some wonderful scenes like "Office" in the bank, and adds excitement element to the tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, the film revolves around real people in an unusual position. It is not about championships and more about sensitive relationships. British filmmaking at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
