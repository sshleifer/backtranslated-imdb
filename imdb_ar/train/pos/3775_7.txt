My Take: Chaos, but even fantasy. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as the punk rock idiots in this sequel to BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADFENTURE, now a classic cult. In this sequel, Bill and Ted are given much to do more than travel through time. They may also travel to heaven and hell too! At the beginning of this series, Bill and Ted are preparing for the Battle of the Bands competition, which may make them more famous than ever before. Meanwhile, after many years in a futuristic civilization, the Time Wizard of the first film (George Carlin, who is always watching) runs a university that praises the names of Bill and Ted. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland of The Hunt FOR RED October) plans to get rid of the two frozen rock stars once and for all. So it sends two identical versions of the Android system (Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do the dirty job. <br /> <br /> After that, Bill and Ted face the experience of death and must find their way in hell, with the people they have come across to include the worst memories of the duo, and then across the sky trying to return to Earth to save their friends ... and show them. Along this troubled journey, playing table games without death (William Sadler, DIE HARD 2) reminds us of a similar moment in SEVENTH SEAL classic classic 1957, helping a couple of intelligent alien beings and more. <br /> <br /> The BOGUS JOURNEY collection of heavy special effects tricks is not up-to-date, and even some humor, form and appearance at the moment are fairly dated (to be frank, the film also seems to have been released in the wrong year, But with a little lack of imagination and the sudden shift of performance and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS's journey is fun, imaginative and yes, fake. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
