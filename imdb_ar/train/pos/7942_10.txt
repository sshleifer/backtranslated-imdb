Giallo lovers, look for this rare film. It is well written, and filled with all sorts of usual low life that fills these films. I do not want to give up anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The entire film creates a very exotic ambience, and you do not know what to expect or suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw this movie in English is European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
