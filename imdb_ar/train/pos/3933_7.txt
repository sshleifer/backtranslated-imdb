The problem of portraying a real person in life lies in that performance can be good, but still ineffective if the audience does not believe that the actor depicts the person. This is the main issue with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda is doing great, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was speaking exactly as Fonda portrayed it. <br /> <br /> This is the foundation of a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Lincoln in the lead. Whether this is a real story or not, I do not know, but if it is not, why tell it to use Lincoln as a central figure? It does not matter though. In the film, Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There really is not much film, and as a result, it seems somewhat empty. I wanted more story and personal development. The film is 100 minutes long, but it does not look like it. There are some small scenes that characterize Lincoln and the growing relationship with Mary Todd, but they look superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good everywhere, but as I said, the performance of Fonda works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I do not think the real Lincoln was that soft talk. He has a big voice when he needs it, like when a drunken guinea pig persuades a defendant to appear before the court, but Fonda portrays Lincoln submissively. Other performances are strong, especially Alice Brady in the role of Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a nice lady we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted her help. <br /> <br /> It seems that John Ford is thinking of this film as an epic, and at the time it was released, perhaps it was. But even so, there is not enough material to be presented as such. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful clock, but it's not a classic hour.
