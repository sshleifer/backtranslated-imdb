I rarely have a film so complete that I have to talk about it right away. This movie is definitely some of the best entertainment available and it is very authentic. I have come across the vision of the Madbalij version, but I am now on my way to grab the DVD remake tool with an original Chinese dialogue. However, the dubbing did not object and sometimes some humorously ridiculous humor was presented: "Basman Klan shakes the world !!!" <br /> <br /> Stories continue to be told according to Chinese intrigues and intrigues. , And personal relationships. You can anticipate shifts and turns when the five toxins are detected and the expert speed. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are martial arts in their own category and must be seen as authentic. It's like watching real animals fighting each other, but being interpreted from their own martial arts. This level of skill among the crew is unprecedented in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The group offers a large dose of ancient Chinese culture and is recommended only based on the true intent of the film in the narrative of the martial arts story battle and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people flocking with each other, along with the old Chinese torture forms, so be my guest!
