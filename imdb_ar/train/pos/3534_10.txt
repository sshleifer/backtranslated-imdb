It's a very unusual film, where the star with the highest bills is only literally halfway up. However I was engaged by tying the Phantom Lady. Curtis, despite his parents Scott Henderson falsely, seems to be a bit difficult to be sympathetic to (perhaps he should have shaved his hair) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the police officers to at least fairly innocently. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone like Jack Marlowe, he found that his portrayal of the character was admirably complicated. He's not a Punk Stock. The great actor of character Elisha Cook Junior is again at the highest level as a "little man with great ambitions". His drumming in musical numbers added a welcome touch of sexual excitement. However, this film is carried by the capable and efficient Ela Raines as the devoted will be loved by Henderson, Carol Richmond. She certainly has the talent and presence of her screen in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is her first work that I have seen and I certainly tend to see her other roles. The rest of the cast is also more than competent. In general, the mystery of Nawar is a very satisfactory film that today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world. Recommended, 8/10.
