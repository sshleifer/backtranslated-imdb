Excellent offer for mature women, which will lose everything (even the penger has a mortgage). The way you get involved in this "work" of yours, the innocence, the true love that exists among the inhabitants of a small town, is completely mixed up to provide us with a new, light and funny comedy. I could not stop laughing at a very funny scene of two big women at a drugstore. <br /> <br /> I like European films, and with films like this, my opinion is growing stronger. The film I also recommend and closed my eyes, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Save Grace, a comedy enjoyed by many friends like myself. You will love it.
