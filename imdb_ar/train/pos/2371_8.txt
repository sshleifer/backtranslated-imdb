I suggested renting this movie to my friend and it was binding because he saw the movie already and said it was fine. I thought the title was a bit small because the version in our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I was expecting this film to be somewhat troublesome with a killer wooden man. But he opened with a good scene and killed the victim immediately. Twenty years later, he killed his son, who witnessed the two men (including his mother) and witnessed the suicide of his parents even in an isolated cabin in the forest with his friends and girlfriend. His fathers. Very good for the sequel and I have not even seen the first.
