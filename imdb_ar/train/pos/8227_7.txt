An interesting film by Paul Winfield as an investigator in the murder case. Paul Winfield was a weak actor who played all his roles so easily, and it was hard to know that the man was acting. Probably the most famous by young viewers as the voice / narrator of the "Secret City", Winfield finishes his career with a film to it; but as always, Winfield shines. Fun viewing. <br /> <br /> Erika Elinayak is fine, Erika Ilinayak, it's good to look at her but she leaves much of what is desirable in acting. However, to be fair, this is one of my best efforts. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: an exciting story not to be missed by any of Paul Weinfield's fans. A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield to the celluloid sky. What a representative. We will miss him.
