If John Thaw has not played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or "The Sweeney" and other products, he will remember this unforgettable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> With impressive support and equally impressive performance by his partner (the young Nick Robinson in his first role), and nondescript actors, this adaptation of the charming Michel Maggiorean is a fitting reminder of his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story about an old widow from Norfolk having to accommodate a little boy from London before and during the flashy war, I found a clear mistake in the timeline, and I must go to the makers of this film to correct this mistake. They must also be commended for not exaggerating the story and preventing what could easily have been turned into chaos. <br /> <br /> If you keep a compact library or video library, this is a good feeling making for a TV movie that is absolutely must be included.
