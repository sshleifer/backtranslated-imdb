Life Pod is one of those movies that you only watch and try not to analyze too much. Acting is somewhat amateurish, at best. Special effects are clearly low budget, but not too bad. The story line is fairly stocky, but with an interesting twist. Running the amok computer, but not exactly the computer and running the amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. The film is still in its moments and is very tight. For me, at least part of the attraction of this film is the prominent role of Christine Debel. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she was a former colleague a month, she is nice enough. In each Life Life is very similar to other low-cost Sci-Fi movies in the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> White Star Lines bit is cute, if not quite accurate. The last White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines 1947. The last ship to sail under the colors of White Star was Britannic (not Titanic's sister), which was sold for scrap in 1960.
