Nothing revolutionary here; just an elegant cinema and self-control. <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively confined to a lousy police station, mostly in a single interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who filmed this wonderful film SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates cut off profiles of exterior panels as Visualize the minimum language language. Miller's setting, especially early, is breathtaking, as is his superb handling of the central interior scene, which makes him captivate the viewer. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as wonderful as usual, having successfully legitimized the character of this, on paper, clich√©: the frantic, hard-tempered detective. Ventura lives in the role, which makes him completely believable, although the script gives us little access to his inner work; the film ends at the moment when it seems he will be forced to face his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michelle Cerrott is equal to the task like a suspected child murderer who brilliantly flattens with the only person who folds thinking. Exchanges between the two are often fraught with tension and the aura of the playing field that constantly turns into a battle of intelligence. The character of Serrault is rotten, hated, and deplorable, and then later .... <br /> <br /> The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if it is supposed to look for one, is a condemnation of the police methodology and the type of pressure that makes the cop Very enthusiastic to, if necessary, close the cases at the expense of justice. Although the film does not shine in most of its length except as a typical example of how to transform a possible scenario that could be limited to a dramatic drama of prosperity in the film economy. <br /> <br />
