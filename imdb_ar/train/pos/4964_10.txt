I really really liked this show! I've always loved 1990's shows for Space Ghost! This show was a joy and I can not believe why the "Adult Pool in the Cartoon Network" is showing such a funny show like this on air. I hope they put this presentation on DVD or anything. The show revolves around Brak (from Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his life every day with his mother, father and best friend who loves to fall so much, Zorak! It was my favorite episodes where Zorak got this good singing sound and then his voice gave him no money to make Zorak sing at all. The other episode I love is the one that did not stop Barak and Zorak from their school duties, then returned from Sunday to Friday, then returned forever and then returned to the day that the invention of homework and then returned to the current homework did not exist! Another episode I love is the episode where Brack Dad and their neighboring neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, continue to reach this critical situation, then eat a gigantic worm. Another episode I admired was the one in which Zorak took an authoritarian attitude, and then took a new person to his post. I also love lots of other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is beaten, blown up and kicked off!
