As long as I knew that Ann Disalvo was a wonderful character, I know now that she is a great writer / director too. I've been a fan ever since I first saw it in Perfect, My Favorite Year, DC Cab and Stardust Memories. <br /> <br /> It's very rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything. They were missing from the screen for a very long time. It is also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than sit-com. This is her best work since "Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an American-Italian family you will love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, see it.
