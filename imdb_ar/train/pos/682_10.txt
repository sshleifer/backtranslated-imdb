This is one of my favorite movies all the time, and although it may move very slowly for some, it is worth watching. Company lawyers (Richard Chamberlain) are withdrawn to a case involving indigenous people "the city", and this is not a normal case. Well, a man died but it was not quite natural killing. There was also a larger amount than the average of the recent rains, and the atmosphere of most of the film was rather troublesome and repressive. Indigenous people dwell in secret and refuse to pour beans. This has a lot to do with the white men who make assumptions about the "city" versus the indigenous "tribes." Of course, the "father" of the big city will not use tribal roads. Ahh Chamberlain has strange dreams and is somewhat the key to what happens, although no matter how many times I've seen them, I can not understand the exact relationship. It is a very strange and frightening film, a good example of Peter Ware's ability to create tension from nothing. The end is a bit vague but I consider it literally, it's the easiest way out and the most terrifying. 10 out of 10 is highly recommended.
