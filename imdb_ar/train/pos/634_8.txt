I was one of about 200 people who were lucky enough to see the early sneak of the movie. <br /> <br /> Stardist follows Shaban Tristan in a quest to find a fallen star and return him to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, an entrance between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just fun to watch, and has something for everyone. All the scenes are beautifully displayed and the comedy is spread through the film making it funny without being vulgar. If you have to compare a movie to another, the Bride Bride is probably a classic. <br /> <br /> All of the shows are great, and the beautiful Claire Danis makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine, a reliable naive star under Michelle Pfeiffer making a great performance rating as Larnia ... but the performance we have to talk about is Robert De Niro. .. In every scene he is caught stealing the show ... <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story, this is the movie. Do not get upset by the description, there's enough erotic comedy, not to mention a lot of eye candy with Claire Danis and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained all the time. The cinematic work has ended and the movie's feelings have become ... Nothing seems to have to do with the film.
