Blond and Blonder puts Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more of the movie, you're totally unreasonable. It seems like a late era of the Carry On era, when the series no longer burns on the tracks, but it was still more funny, think Behind Behind or England and you will not be away from the mark. Pamela and Dennis are amazing and charming and know that this is not a masterpiece they do, although you can give me more things that I told them to like. The supporting crews are active, even if some are not good; I can not see a couple of roles in a movie that actually forgot to make a big difference in anything, so just smile. I really think that Blonde and Blonder ace and hope you hate me for that.
