This is not another look at the Holocaust, but it is an intimate story about the events on a small street in Berlin and some of the people who participated in it. This film begins in New York City, where Ruth Weinstein (Juta Lamp) mourning the death of her husband and her family gathered at her side. The daughter of Ruth Hanna (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fisher (Doris Shide) and is therefore traveling to Germany and locates the 90-year-old girl who reports on the events in Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo will keep all Jewish couples in a building on Rosenstrasse, For an immunity from marrying Aryans for nine days, a group of women were waiting outside and yelling for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svia Lohdi) is waiting for her mother to come out and she has nowhere to go but she meets Lina, 33, Katia Riemann, who takes her. Lena Fabian's husband (Martin Veville) is also at home and is finally trying to get in touch with Nazi officers to get them to do something. <br /> <br /> This film, directed by Margaret von Trotta, who makes her first feature film nearly 10 years after working on television, is clearly not a film of her most provocative efforts, she remains one of the most respected filmmakers in Europe . This is not one of those Nazi films where we see terrible acts of inhumanity to the Jews, although we see some intense treatment being issued, but instead, this is a new event that tells a small event that means life and death to the people concerned. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door to debate about the circumstances but what he simply wants to do is just highlight a small but real event in life that happened during a historic period. Part of the power of the films comes from their representatives, and there are some good performances that are especially glamorous by Reemann and Cheb LÃ¶hde, and it is always good to see Schroeder (Amy and Jaguar) in a pivotal role. This is not a great film or something that will change your view in World War II, but given the death of innocent lives because of the events, I think the reason alone is important enough to recount this true story.
