Making a book in a page-by-page story is not a good idea. When people read books, they automatically begin to produce their own "mental film" about who the characters look like, where they are, and how things progress. The mindset is different for everyone, and that's why when "REAL" is finally shown, you'll always get a certain segment of the movie audience who are disappointed because it does not measure up. <br /> <br /> Every scriptwriter and director can hope to achieve it no matter what they see in the film, and hope that it will come as close as their audience can expect. <br /> <br /> There is no better case for this position than the films based on Stephen King's novels. When filmmakers capture the essence of their stories at least, the results can be amazing and really scary (CARRIE, SALEM'S LOT, DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans see as a terrifying mess (KUBRICK's The Bright, IT and TOMMYKNOCKERS) . <br /> <br /> Although it is not close to being an ideal fit for the king, PET PET SEMATARY has many moments of intense anxiety that affects the skin and bones and seems to have bled on the screen directly from the book, you can forgive a lot of Shortcomings. So, we have the musical director who turned into Marie Lambert's video to thank him, (as SIESTA, not exactly a horror film, but must be put in your horror and another hell in your list), from the Man-ster script himself, and perhaps one of his best . <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I will not put you to sleep with a lot of details. Dr. Louis Creed (Del Medkiev) moved his family to the ideal home in the country. Well, it is almost perfect, except for two small bad details: the stretch of expressway highway congested by the highway, and the large pet cemetery in the forest. Since Lewis is a veterinarian and he has a little boy for a son ... well, even if you did not read the book, do the Frican maths. It is the story of the king, after all, so no mystery where this is heading. <br /> <br /> It's not the destination that interests us here, but the scary stops all the way. Some of the most familiar scenes from the book are brought to the troubled and precarious life: Rachel Creed's horrific memory of her paralyzed sister; Louis encounters the deadly wounded runner Victor Pascoe (Brad Greenquist), before and after his death; To the "other cemetery" outside the pet cemetery. And this third act ... If some nightmares do not give you, you may have to check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Good performances by everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwyn as a good-neighbor, Judd Crandall, who gets the best line in the story that sums up everything: "Sometimes, death is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film's release is the casting of Lewis's son, Gage (Mikko Hughes). Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get this kind of performance required from a child at that age to conclude a deal on it, Lambert and his crew still do their best, and unfortunately, Hughes was at that time inappropriate to "sell" his intended role as an evil coma , Possessed a demon. This takes you to the outside of the movie whenever it appears, although the scenes in which it appears are still brilliantly displayed, (especially Gwyn's death scene). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, everything else is still as good as you get. Carrie still carries the title of best adapting to the king as far as I'm concerned. But SEMATARY exists directly in the top five positions. <br /> <br /> However, will anything that has been adapted to the screen based on King's book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not likely to be blood ... now.
