As I noted with a lot of IMDb comments, it seems that some reviewers are demanding that every movie they see have clever, vulgar plots that outshine your intelligence. I'm not one of those people. If I watch Action, I want to see explosions, shootings and heroes. If I watch a comedy, I want to cry in my eyes. You found the idea. So watching a horror film, I want in the first place to be scared. Grudge film is a very scary film, in each of the scenes "jump" well executed, scary images. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years, and I'm talking about professors like Dario Argento, rather than the directors of some of the infamous teen horror movies that are spreading these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. More horrifying than the original Japanese "episode" (which I think is a wonderful movie).
