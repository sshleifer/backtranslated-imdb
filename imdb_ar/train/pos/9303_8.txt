When you watch this movie, you should notice that it is not a regular movie. She has no real story only characters, a group of gangsters who meet in perfect harmony. The dialogue is great, you can just relax and listen. The film stands out and that's why it's hard to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> This is why user comments are mixed with this movie. <br /> <br /> I love one movie and recommend it to anyone who likes branching lines and things that are different from "normal". You can not put your finger on what's so wonderful about it, it's just a comic world where gangsters rule. The place of love and danger. Movie you can see more than once.
