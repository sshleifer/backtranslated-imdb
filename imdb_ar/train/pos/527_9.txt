It is not surprising that the filmmaker / director Michael Powell is "a matter of life and death," a brilliant and German fantasy of American Presburger since 1946 to be his favorite in both films. This colorful romantic adventure that was released during the Second World War would have provided only a tonic for a nation suffering from shock and needing a good lift. <br /> <br /> After a series of other national war films, "Archers have made this the strangest, least superficial, and most patriotic person." A British patriot to preserve British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good morals) A prominent American character in his baroque works, his technical creativity and a wonderful multi-ethnic team. <br /> <br /> The curious 1946 classic echos, "It's a wonderful life", AMOLAD opens on a solid foundation, with one of those who preach the voice of hunger exhorting The earth and the sky, and what a wonderful world we live in. Then he goes into the British cockpit It was a mistake, but the connection quickly became apparent with the events that followed. <br /> <br /> The race took about five minutes, a quick exchange The fire between the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio contact Jun (Kim Hunter) to catch a breath of intimacy.Peter surrenders to die, yet exhausts a lot of vitality and magic and heavy confessions, and ends his warm relationship with Jun with mutual exchange of " . <br /> <br /> Pieter holds the magic of the moment by supervising his 71 conductor, who was to be transported to the "Other World", escaping death and finding himself stranded on the beach. Later meet in June riding a bicycle, and immediately matches the body with sound. <br /> <br /> But knowing that they are wrong, the Supreme Court wants Peter to be returned, and to order the French commander (Maurice Goring) to return to earth to retrieve him. But Peter is determined to live because of the mistake of June and his commander, deliberately guarding his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate ultimately lies in the Heavenly Court and the US Attorney General (Raymond Massey), who is composed of several deceased war heroes and distinguished British delegates. The surreal experience, which melts from b / w to the rich Technicolor, once the verdict is pronounced, may be a dream, but the last shot at the hospital confirms the expected results. <br /> <br /> Abstract: The "Stairway to Heaven" frame is used twice: the first time in b / w, when Peter and his mysterious French guardian rise to the top, crossing giant statues of potential solicitors Peter for trial , Including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the soft-colored color drawer provides the setting for an iconic picture in the cinema - Peter and Juno frozen side by side, their stunning eyes fixed forward in the frame, and their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The potential affection between Peter and Junio ​​does not turn out to be soft or long; the nobles are dealt with and the couple are well enough to marry and simply need to convince people of their love, so they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French leader, who can freeze time and people's bodies, captures many of their key moments together, lecturing Peter about history and his pernicious tricks, pinching Peter's "Best 100 Game of Tricks" and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> As it was visually inspired, like the other Powell / Presburger collaborations, this was the first time that they combined color with B / W? The latter are of cheerful quality when used for sky scenes, both equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The outstanding script is more than the fantasy group's design, with a dialogue that seems so instant that it does not appear to have been written or executed on the screen. The writings of Paul / Brisper deserve an equal tribute with their strength for color and composition. <br /> <br /> Matter of Life and Death was produced in 1946, one of those challenging, fresh and innovative films, even in this age when CGI intensifies its artificial effects, and perhaps strips them of their emotional wonder . <br /> <br /> Other controversial changes include the need to reduce the average seconds of cutting and the inevitable call to shorten the dialogue so that it can maintain low interest periods for most audiences. Powell sings a mantra that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experience images without betraying the logical evolution of Peter's predicament.
