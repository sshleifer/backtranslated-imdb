This short film was nominated for an Oscar and I wish it had won! Basically the jam session was filmed among some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the incredible music! Often, Hollywood has adopted jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare sight on a film in improvised jam. This has been added to the movie preservation list and deserves it. TCM runs this as a league run and runs it every March at a time because of its "31 Days to Oscar" honors. From the city center in the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and smooth shot, the network barely moved. Most strongly and highly recommended !!!
