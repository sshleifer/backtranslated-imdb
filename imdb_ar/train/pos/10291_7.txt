After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny and positive film. It was not one of the best performances by Jim Carrey, but it was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Corell on "The Daily Show!" <br /> <br /> I like the selections of director Tom Shadyak for films. He also LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and the evil professor. In each of these three and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a great comic star and tells a human story with him. It's hard to find a director who knows comedy, gets the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more written references. I remember only three specific written references and were the most extreme parts of the entire film. I think the first few drafts of the script contained more Biblical references, but were excluded because producers were afraid to offend people. This is very bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
