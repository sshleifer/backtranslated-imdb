I heard a few friends one day saying, "Scarface suck ... some idiots tried to make another land in the early 1980s." Now, I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN so I decide to stay away from them. Then my friend gave me a DVD and said, "This is the number 1 with the whale," confused that I tried it. This is the best movie ever. It's more realistic than all this nonsense about stolen car racing that is too expensive for someone in this area can afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is some humor though ... Pelicangs and 80s light music. However, what is better than the Al Pacino that uses the M203? I give this **** ****, ideal for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
