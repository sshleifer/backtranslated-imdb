Great fun. I went with 8 friends to preview the sneak preview of this movie. We came to see a different look, but after 10 minutes we wonder what made us ourselves at this time the jokes became funny and remained funny throughout the film. In the first part, just ask yourself about these things "malinski" and "bellini" (there are many examples of this language) and because they continue to repeat the same jokes (with different definitions), they become more fun and entertaining. In the search for malinski, all the main characters are presented first even the strangest of the following. Until half the film was over, we did not even know the name of this film because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak show, but we certainly had a good time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think half of them did not like them and the other half loved the movie. If you love exotic comedies with a wonderful dialogue, you will love them. Apart from Clooney, this movie deserves a much better rating than the IMDB 5.6 that I had at that time as I write this, but when I see more of that ppl, I'm sure it will rise. 7.0 reasonable I suspect, I will give it 8 out of 10 (10 out of 10 after a little beer)
