Good effort for an Australian display. Which may not be surprising in vision, where there seems to be some kind of resurgence in Australian high-quality drama. Do I dare compare this offer with the brilliance of love on my way? No. But it reminds us of our early secret life. The actors are wonderful, Ghibney works her charm in the first two episodes I saw, and the British actors are also strong, especially the old and lizard characters. But the lamp may be energy-saving (not that it needs to provide) if the show is getting another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the series of awesome awesome time markers a few years ago, but he was wonderful in evergreen. It's also good to see Brook Satchwell again. Let's hope the show continues to improve with each episode.
