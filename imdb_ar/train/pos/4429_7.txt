I personally thought that the film was very good, a very good actor by Tadanobo Asano of Aichi Keller fame. I can not really say much about the story, but there were parts that intrigued me a bit, and overall I thought the film was too long. Other than that, the film contained wonderful battles, great acting, many beautifully photographed locations, wonderful effects, and lots of swordplay. Another powerful effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I can not say more about the film now, but if you look at Asian movies only, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I would suggest you try to rent it, but if you are dead. A fan of hard Asian cinema I would say this must be in your Japanese movie group very good.
