If you like Roman Polanski's "dissonance", you may have to check out "Tenant" because it is a similar concept, only with Polanski entering to play schizophrenia. This is actually one of the favorite things in his films - secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course - a direct journey forward towards the mental breakdown of a man moving to the former apartment of a suicide bomber. The other inhabitants of the building are all flabby and clinging to keeping the noise low - until the little "chuckles" a big problem, and Polanski, who is staring at the stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and surrenders to his more tenderness as the film continues on. It comes to the point where he wears clothes and acts like a former tenant and realizes that it is only a matter of time before Tor decides to reactivate her deadly jump from the window ... The film is a bit slow and manipulated while, if you've ever seen Roman Polanski, To know that it will end with impatience and that this click does not disappoint me. It is also best not to question the complexity of the hypothesis and to consider it merely a descent into madness, because it is sometimes surrealistic. Polanski is very good as a timid, misguided resident, who somehow attracts the brilliant Isabelle Adjani. We also get him running as he walks, which is both annoying and funny at the same time! Damn, he makes for one ugly chick! So the Polanski lovers - who can already consider his 30-year-old child sexual concern - must enjoy "The Tenant" as a fun, entertaining recreation ...
