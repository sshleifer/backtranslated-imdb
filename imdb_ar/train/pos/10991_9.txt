Cypher is a movie worth watching because it is not a flick about science fiction. The technical approach was drawn with dark scenes and a kind of overall view of what was going on. The close-up view of the camera is how the director maintains the phantom plot. The scientific side of the film is secondary to the film's plot. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, however, the director takes good advantage of the props. <br /> <br /> Personal development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northham, decides to indulge in the world of espionage. It is up to the public to see his mysterious character and puzzles that keep the public interested until the end.
