Although the elements of the "Eighth Day" chart seem to have been performed several times, the film still contains a lot of sparkle, mystery and symbolism that featured the first film by Jacko van Durmall. Although it is not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain in the favorites list, the film still leaves us a lot of feelings. Daniel O'Toile, of the 2001 film The The Closet, who did not enjoy his taste, reduces his role, afraid of overstating him (indeed, the role could have been easily destroyed if the actor was very dramatic). However, I felt that the part needs more realism towards it, focusing more on the personality itself rather than just the personal growth. <br /> <br /> Do not walk in this movie to expect the dark humor and unexpected changes from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent film, if not defective
