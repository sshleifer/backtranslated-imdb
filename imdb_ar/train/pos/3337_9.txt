It is a wonderful movie for both romantic lovers and sports lovers. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie. As a fan of Drew, it was very good to shine after having disrupted several times. I had doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he gave his words as a beloved sports comedy. Comedy In this wonderful film, there were several moments laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> The first rocky date began when she appeared in her apartment with flowers and was sick of her stomach from taking up a new place earlier in the day. Instead of leaving, he helps take care of her, helps her change into a pajama, then cleans the luck in her toilet and bathroom, and later tells her that she is "very ladylike ... not big." Everything goes well between Ben and Lindsay in the whole winter but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to realize how obsessed Ben Red Sox is and why this man who looks great is still lonely. Trying to ignore them and think of them as a good thing because they have a busy schedule and will not feel guilty about overtime hours while in games. She even buys all the books on The Red Sox that you can find, including a book about Bambino's Curse. <br /> <br /> Everything goes well until Lindsay gets the wrong warning after she's missed her job. They both realize how dangerous it is and start to wonder if this is the person you want to be with. A very touching part of the film is after I told him that she had gotten her period, and unfortunately he appears to him wearing a red Sox T-shirt he had bought if she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends' birthday party after saying: "I had to check my schedule and when I saw there was a Red Sox / Yankee game I knew I was going to participate. This game ". Ben told her that he was "the best night of his life." After a short time of contact with his friend who went to the game, he abandoned the concert and told him, "It's the best game ever !!!" "It was a good few minutes ago," he says. <br /> <br /> So they split up for a while, realizing his obsession and deciding to sell his season tickets he inherited from his uncle because if he did not do so, "say much about what he gave up." Lindsay discovers a friend and decides to stop him from realizing that he is doing it for her. And it ends up looking so cute how his childhood love for baseball has ended because of a completely new deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and even attend the final in the St. Louis World Series, a happy ending everywhere. 2 Excellent!
