It is an excellent film, a kind of treasure that one can only see through intermittent cinematic performances, because it is not available on video / DVD. The way the film starts with the arrival of the lovers, and ends with them leaving (although there is a lot between them, and not staying in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure and the feeling that everything is fine with the world. If you get a chance to see this movie, do it. I can not wait to see it again and I wish it will be placed in the public version.
