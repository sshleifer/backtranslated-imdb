Classic comics, always fun and funny. It's an interesting plot filled with lovable characters. Road Rovers is a showable show. It's 13 short episodes, and if you can manage an opportunity to see it, you have to. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should issue a DVD containing all 13 episodes. I will definitely buy it if they do, and if they do, you should buy it too. If you have children who love dogs, they will love Road Rovers! Rovers should have been more interested in broadcasting, it was certainly a very original and special offer that should have been appreciated more than it was.
