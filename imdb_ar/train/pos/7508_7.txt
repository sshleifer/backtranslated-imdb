Great acting by Gritchen Mall. This movie is one of the best biographies that hit the screen at some point. Although they cover most of my small home life, they also managed to stay on the course of the center mostly and it is something that most CVs seem to lack. There is some disturbingly beautiful and funny text in dialogue and representation. This film is an excellent break from a monastery. "American Psycho", and I think this will appear through its best work so far. Oh, and as a film buff, I gave this movie 100% in the cinema section. It was amazing how successful they were in getting a look from the 1950s with modern film stocks. Greetings to D.O.P. Every place is very enjoyable. I recommend anyone interested in seeing it: 8/10.
