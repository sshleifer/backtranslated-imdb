A few years ago, a friend of one of his friends got a video with Michael Mann "Heat". After we finished this film, and we were about to stand, we saw that there was another film after him, hard on the cover of the cassette that was not written by the owner. However, we were all shocked at our seats by its privileged opening, which lacked credit. <br /> <br /> After just two hours, I sat there wondering: How did I never hear of this masterpiece? . <br /> <br /> This film was Europa. Lars von Trier woke up to the film Noir from the Dead, a fact disassembled with clearly intentional groups, but often there was a paranoid resemblance to German pictures after the war I had seen. Then the hard cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a moral journey that is difficult to take and has no happy ending. A German-American peace advocate comes to post-war Germany, determined to do something good to pay for the bombs dropped by his fellow citizens. But it mostly meets distrust and self-destruct challenge. He rents with Zentropa, a company to eat and sleep (like Mitropa), the owner of which is a collaborator with the Nazis. Our hero is in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Nazi terrorists after the war. When the world (or the Europeans only) does not understand anymore, in his anger, he blows up a railway bridge just under the train. <br /> <br /> As a last note, to historical health: in the real world, the wolf was not as important as the film suggests, most of them a propaganda coup for the Nazis. After a unit of Special Security Forces assassinated Raed Aachen occupied by the Allies, two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced the creation of full hordes of saboteurs and terrorists who would be willing to fight behind the heinous lines. But only a few hundred of them, mostly Hitler's youth, received training, and while they were deployed two or three times to kill suspected communists or foreigners working in forced labor in the Bavarian villages to provoke constant fear of the population, with Hitler's death and the end of the war, all collapsed. <br /> <br /> However, the propaganda of the Werewolf had a profound impact on the occupiers. They were afraid of the loser everywhere, and suspect that he was behind any serious incident - but without exception another reason was later found (ignored by some false historians recently). For example, when a major gas exploded at the destroyed Bremen police headquarters, or when a Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The influence was stronger on the Soviets, who had arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) "Proactively" on suspicion of being depraved and locked them in prison camps where many died.
