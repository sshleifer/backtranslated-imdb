In this film, JUST was made during production code production, and Jan Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wise sidekick who stalks the "Kitty" man. A girl from Missouri begins with the girls on the train, where Edie promised herself to make money while looking for a millionaire couple, with some remaining in the process. It did not take long to meet Frank Cousins ​​(Louis Stone), the gentle doctor at the Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the films of Andy Hardy.) But everything is not as it seems .. The LOVED characters must have Harlow's line " They can accept expensive gifts like those of a gentleman unless they are engaged. " "You know we were not alone together," one of them said. "Yes, we will not!" Lionel Barrymore is t. R. Beige, another rich, trustworthy, comes to the rescue when a problem occurs in the search for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares, "You are in spite of my scratching of your list - not a man for ladies." I wonder what this line could have been just a few years before the appearance of the Hayes blade in the city. What was he really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the "Baby Talker" HD as listed in the credits on the IMDb. It seems that she was only in the Chopis from 1931 - 1939, with "Munchkin" in the Wizard of Oz is the last part she played. Fun, cleancut romp as girls chase men all over the country. Search for Nat Pendleton as a savior, who was the 1920 Olympic wrestler (silver medalist) turned into a movie star (he was in many of Dr. Kildares, and will appear in four Harlow films.) Frances Tun, Love Stories, and even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit. "Palm Beach", although the exterior view of the city center looks like a background.
