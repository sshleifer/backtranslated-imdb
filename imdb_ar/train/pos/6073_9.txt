A university professor says Othello may be the best drama for Shakespeare. I do not know if you agree with him yet. I bought this video a copy of the movie. First I love Kenneth Branagh as an Iago, it was quite complicated and worked well in this modification. Surprisingly, he did not direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne explains that American actors can play Shakespeare as British actors do. There is no British-American issue on this issue. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the audiences he deserves. Apart from Shakespeare's other tragedies, the issue of race is dealt with. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and showed the complexity of their union. While Othello Desimona loves all his heart, he is weak because of jealousy and is afraid of losing to a non-Moroccan man like Casio. It's a wonderful scene at the end of the film but I will not reveal the end. It is worth watching. I think they've edited a lot of lines for two hours, but they always edit Shakespeare.
