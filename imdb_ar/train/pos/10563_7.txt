Wow ... what a whirlwind. The 1930s are a decade with many films of every kind that I can imagine, especially during the early talk stage. There were steady and painful films, such as "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were films that did not give him comfort, sometimes in good and sometimes other ways. This is one of the films that does not stop for a minute, and this is strange and unfortunate. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "Street 42", must have been a king of depression in musicals, and he may have been enthusiastic about the possibilities of sound that he brought into the world of cinema, because he filled this picture with it. There should not be a full minute or two minutes without a music or talking person. He's totally crazy! I was thinking that the movie deserves 5 (or 6, tops) because the speed was very bad, because it was madly fast and sometimes I do not know what was going on and what I was thinking about. The characters seemed to run and go to places, talking about things that did not interest me and perhaps nobody else. I thought I would be rewarded with a small headache. I also noticed that Lloyd Bacon was in the lead in "42nd Street" and Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie that was the best part of it. And learn what? The same thing happened with "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It has become, hands, the most impressive musician I've ever seen. The last part offers us some musical numbers and that is, believe me, something that makes seeing the rest of the other films worth. The numbers are flawless! There are three large and most impressive parts is definitely second. Suddenly the screen was full of wonderful and innovative work for the camera, beautiful people and ordinary entertainment made me forget my little crack.
