The great talents of Michael Powell and Emmerich Presburger are notable in their film "A Question of Life and Death". This was part of the tribute to Mr. Powell, who recently played at Walter Reed in New York. This film features, in particular, one of the best British films of that or any other era. <br /> <br /> "Matter of Life and Death" contains a wonderful film by Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to do wonders with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast between monochromatic tones given to scenes that played in the sky and color when the movement returns to Earth. This was a great coup, and he was very advanced on his time. The black-and-white sequence that includes Peter's long staircase and the captain must be one of the most amazing things in any film. <br /> <br /> Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment about the great actor Powell and Pressberger will come out of the great and distinguished cast, who responded admirably to the direction of the directors. <br /> <br /> David Nevin, is Peter, who has been hit by his plane and best friend has died as a result. This film is one of the highlights of Mr. Neven's life. He was an excellent film actor because he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good like June, the woman who spoke to Peter while his plane was falling from the sky. As fate will be, Peter and Junio ​​are in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors decorate this film with their presence. Robert Kot, who is Bob, the man who entered Paradise, but was surprised that his friend Peter had never made the trip. Starring Marius Goring, who steals the movie as a 71 commander. Mr. Goring, who worked with directors, is one of the best things in the film. Roger Levisi, as Dr. Frank Reeves, is one of the best aspects of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> A "matter of life or death" is an immortal film that will always be seen with gratitude to the creators.
