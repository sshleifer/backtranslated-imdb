I watched this film while at the University of Birmingham in 1975, when it was shown in conjunction with Red Balloon. Both films are similar in quality to the dream. The bulk of the film requires a fish to swim happily in its bowl while its new owner, a young boy, is away from school. A cat enters the room where the fish are located and begins to chase his prey with caution. The boy starts his journey from home to school, and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his friend. Shake the fish because of the cat's presence, and finally jump out of the bowl! The cat walks quickly to the fish and gently takes it with his feet and returns it to its bowl. The child happily returns to his fish, nothing more wiser. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing in terms of irony and artistic complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have withdrawn the art show in 1959 - it seems to be the most trick of 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, watch it - you will not be disappointed! If you find it, let me know so I can get a copy too!
