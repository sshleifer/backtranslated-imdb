(I'm sorry for my wrong language, I'm not native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally, I agree with all those preferences. But I will not use this somewhat stereotypical way to describe the film here. Because those are "ideal! Best of its kind!" - Make revisions make some people turn (including myself). <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another Hamlet that has the ability to compete with many theatrical and all cinematic shows - then do not miss this one, if you find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, many people will not have any chance to see it.) There seems to be no DVD there, and the German version - well executed - is not available in any way.) <br /> <br /> Just in case I decided to get a copy: delete this version which takes two hours (or so) of this movie. Neither useful nor fun, gives the wrong impression of a film, deals in an exciting way with flow and architecture. The ratio of the 4: 3 aspect ratio was also paralyzed. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
