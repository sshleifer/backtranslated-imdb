They are films like this that make you wish you never picked up a young student at school. If you like this movie, I would suggest that you watch Valentine's Day. I discovered today that the man who played Marty (Simon) killed himself shortly after the screening of the film is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if that's because of the role he played in the film. It begins when Carroll refers him to go to the girls' toilet to act as if they were about to do so. When he changed in the bathroom, Carol's folk friends sneaked into the bathroom and prepared for everything, a camera, an electric shock, a pole. When Marty opened the curtain with a naked butt he realized that he had been cheated. He tries to cover the bathroom, but the kids open it, grab Marty and start to mean him while the camera is rolling. They took him, drew his head in the tulle while washing it, and did the electricity (a little). When the children are in custody, the coach gives him, giving two of the boys to Marty a detailed make him throw. Skip one of the glass windows in the gym using the bricks to make the teacher excuse him. As Marty wriggles in the bathroom, Skip skips into Science Science and mixes some things that look like cocaine but not sure what it is. The laboratory blows up its distortion. Five years later, the children who tortured him that day received calls for a 5-year reunion at the old school that was burned that day. One by one kills people. I do not understand how the girl who sank really sank. She could have a backup after Marty left. I almost went out the first time.
