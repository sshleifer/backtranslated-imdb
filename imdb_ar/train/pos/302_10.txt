This film is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter was no better off and had the best line in the film! "Sam" hits near the house, it's nice to look at it and lots of fun to play with. Ben Jazara was an excellent actor and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I met Arthur on my trips somewhere. Everywhere, an excellent choice to catch any evening.! :-)
