8 Simple Rules is a funny show, but it also contains some life lessons, especially a mature lesson about moving forward after the loss that was the episode in which Paul died and which was the first episode I ever saw in the series on ABC. Hennessy - Mother Kate (Katie Sagall), Bridget's daughters (Cali Coco), Kiri (Amy Davidson), and his son Rory (Martin Spangers) - look to each other for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter). The people of Kate (James Garner and Susan Pleshet) extend his hand. I'm happy later in the second season of this show, they decided to put David Spade in this show because it ended the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all this is good. This show reminds me of many of the classic family soap operas of the 1980s and 1990s that were on ABC.
