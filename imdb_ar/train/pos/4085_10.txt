If you were born soon to finish this movie, and you have a liberal / open-minded family, I'm sure in the early 1980s you would first know walking on your parents who watch dirty movies or filthy movies. You know, not 100% pornographic but rather a chemical blend of actual drama and porn, or you sneak into her collection and come out in a rectangle of plastic for such a movie in a big Doki machine called VHS. You should be very calm and like a ninja but you still have a slight heart failure when there is a huge pop noise when you press the buttons like your Tablet PC for fear of being detected. Whatever the case, these films have been sent to the back of your mind, waiting for and reuniting with this visual "art". Needless to say, this film fits the description above to "T". Many people will comment on the intense sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because of the sensitivity of me, I am very disturbed by the fine details. Was the Creator talking to us at deeper levels of human genetics or what could be considered real abomination, interracial relations, masturbation on the bed frame, or voyeur, or could he be desperate to get a social situation to the point of murder or sexual exploitation For children / homosexuality, or repressed sexual nature of female social elite in the 18th century in France? Who can say, but despite Mr Borwijk's taste for active sexuality, which is the "base" of his work, I say that this film actually speaks to the viewer at a deeper level with regard to primitive differences. Once you have learned this, the story has become more interesting beyond the value of the shock value and there, it deserves review.
