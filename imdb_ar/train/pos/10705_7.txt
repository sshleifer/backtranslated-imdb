The video for this movie did not succeed in achieving justice. Although the film did not know what he really wanted to reach, the first half of the film was a light and romantic comedy and the second had a more serious romantic drama, but the overall effect was much better than I thought it would be. The film was more than just a history film, but the trailer made it more exciting and never made. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I am biased, but this film proved to be a light and sensitive film, albeit somewhat strange and worthy of the best. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
