In your video store, you may find this gem. <br /> <br /> Humanitarian Situation in the Modern Age LA. There is no exaggerated drama, just a breakdown of events that may occur to any group of individuals over time. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joys of urban life and despair. <br /> <br /> The cut is the top layer. Cinema and music follows mood and situation very much. And CAST! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent acting. There is no person out of place or out of character. <br /> <br /> It's really not as slim as you expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you've seen it, do it!
