I never trust anyone's opinions regarding a movie. This applies to critics as well. Sure, if you get positive reviews, that's good in addition, but most of the films that give rise to extreme rave hate it. I enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining movie. Take you out of your life for a few hours and into a fictional character ... to be Catherine Tramel. Sharon Stone is wonderful in this role, just as it was in the first round. Anyone who says it is appalling in this film must have felt the same in the first B / C back to work in the same way that it was working in a basic instinct. Katherine is conducted and played out to perfection. Its linings are a wonderful one, much like the first lines. Who can forget in the first film when you tell the police, "If you arrest me, do that ... otherwise get f ** k out of here!" Wonderful scenery, and believe me, they do it again in this scene. I am captured by them. Her friends, the way you smoked her cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I can not wait until this movie is displayed on DVD, without chopping, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are a lot of transitions, as in the first one, including the end!
