Along with the excellent direction, production, acting and drama that can be predicted is a key message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening leads all the way" for the boom of sound and listening. Sound and listen. In order to get closer to yourself, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or other, listen. The scriptwriters seem to be conveying the "secret of life". The listening leads to self-awareness. It awakens other senses, especially vision and widens the horizon. One spirit can also be discovered. The art of this movie "As in Heaven" has shown a wonderful evolution of life, not only its joy and sorrow, but ultimately the hope of life. All this according to the first instructions of the leading character of the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it leads all the way"
