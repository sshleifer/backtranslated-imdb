De Groot is a very good film. The great plot comes from Tim Krabi's novel, which also adapted the story to the screen. Some first-rate actors, not only by Van Heat, but especially by Marcel Hensma, who mostly did a television work before performing for Axel van de Graf. The film looks like an exciting kick, and puts an excellent mood. Then we start to get to know Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is slowly revealed in a very high-thumb structure, adding to the more romantic and drama-driven side. In the end, all this ends to an emotional end, which will capture the masses of their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you see this movie. It is a must, especially if you love "Spoorloos" (adapting the original screen in Vanishing).
