Although it was unfortunate to get to the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW film) just as we were tired of things like Shakespeare In Love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. In-house look at the play "The Scottish Play" While actors release "Macbeth" when produced to avoid the curse, this is a clear, effective and neat cure for the betrayal that persists in the band. With an impressive impressive degree, looks and looks much better than what its small budget might suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but quite satisfactory.
