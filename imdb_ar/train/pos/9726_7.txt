Well, it was a nice surprise after all. Her trailer was not a good movie at all, it was a bit misleading. Particularly the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, ironic and funny. Less realistic, but I do not think the person who got to the place he got will show signs of such respect for everything his current company represents. One does not become a high suit just to doubt it all over again. The end of the film, during Dolce Vita's show, was very vulgar, vulgar and very disappointing. Of course, a man like Pegg will not continue after his first week in Blitz New York like this. I hope to someday see a decent role written by Megan Fox, where a poor actress plays Bembo. By the way, I do not see why they are the "sex symbol" for this year, I see the hottest girls in almost every cover for each magazine.
