The sponsor is hardly class 4, but for film lovers in the 1940s, it has to be seen almost and rated 9 as a diverse show! I was attracted to watch this in the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Web who plays the role of Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the amazing performance of Doris Day. Outside the movie Jane's Disaster, I've never seen her wear a better song than she does here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, even if he did not see much screen time. It's been some time since I saw the film, but I was almost certain of Humphrey Bogart's appearance. With many familiar faces, it is difficult to trace. If it appears on a TV station near you, be sure to pick up Doris Day sequence, if there is nothing else! <br /> <br />
