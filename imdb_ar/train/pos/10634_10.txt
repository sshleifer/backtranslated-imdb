In order to prevent her hometown friend Albert (Berry King) from being deported to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem in that is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two live separate lives at one night after Albert's birthday party, where they fall in bed and then in love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects that Albert is cheating and shows up at his job late at night after he closes it. What you find will leave the viewer stunned. It is a wonderful movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster have such good roles that it's amazing that they did not get a better appreciation of their work here. Very controversial when released in 1978, the movie "R" now became "PG" at this time the most liberal. <br /> <br /> It was recently released on DVD, and the disc contains an "industry of" section on which its special features are said to be based on a real story, so viewers who say the film is "not true" are wrong. Everyone is a different person who falls in love for different reasons - these are the issues that have been explored in this wonderful film for everyone I love at all!
