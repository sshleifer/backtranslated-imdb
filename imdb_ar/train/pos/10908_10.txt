I could not stop the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It has been disturbing, disturbing, and inspiring in every one. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something to think about what to do with their lives. Or simply, something that would make you think. You see as John lives during the last few months of his life. You see as he spends his days with a positive attitude. At some point you begin to see that he is a really wonderful person. Begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggles will make you cry and laugh and find life a lot easier if you take it one day.
