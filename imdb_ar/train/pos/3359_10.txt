Una giornata particolare is a film that has benefited immensely from closed spaces. In these dull empty spaces, the audience watches the emotional upheavals and loud explosions of two adorable figures in Itur Skola. Marcelo Mastroiani and Sophia Loren play frustrated people who decide to meet with some brief moments of their meaningless lives. It is the element of sadness associated with the novel that makes us think that people will take sides with people close to them. All the men will really feel sad about Sofia Loren's character. Certainly, women are piercing their hearts in the existential plight of Marcelo Mastroiani. Hidden nationalities are also one of the main issues in this sad and painful film. Most characters grapple with issues related to their own gender. Gay film although it was well shot that the gay chapter blends well with women. This is a film by the Italian filmmaker Ituri Scola, a fairly good mix of reality and fiction. His idea is to show how Hitler's arrival changed the destinies of ordinary Italian people. A word about the personal courage that was beautifully played by the great Marcelo Mastroiani. He acts like a real man who does not beg for pity. He happily accepts his fate and prepares to face the worst time of his short but meaningful life. A real masterpiece of cinema !!!
