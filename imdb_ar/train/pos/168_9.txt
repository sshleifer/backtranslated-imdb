This is one of Joan Crawford's best interviews. This was the first pairing of Gable-Crawford, making it clear to MGM and the fans that they were a great team, they led the studio to shoot seven other films with them as participating stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister whose father loses everything in the stock market crash, they must defend themselves and work for a living. Life is difficult in the Depression, and soon their attempts to find legitimate work prove their worth, and resort to underworld activities. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is as excellent as the social who turned into a mall. It is smart, complex and credible. It even angers theatrical rigidity of the early representation of other actors. Clark Gable is masculine in masculine, masculine and shaken as a senseless gangster who gets involved with the character of Crawford. In the same year, he would have played a similar and more successful role in the face of Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", where he earned his position as a major male character at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this kind of role, do not miss the "Paid", which I did a year ago, which is also one of the best early talkie shows. <br /> <br />
