Lee VanCleef is a high-level gangster who surrenders himself to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thief who frequents a billiard room and spends his free time in Frankie's envy. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they form a link that may not be entirely friendly, but it will result at the moment. <br /> <br /> This film came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see an alternative name is "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would help to sell the film more effectively. I suppose this is a tribute to "Mary Dirty, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I saw this shortly after the other Italian crime film, "Violent Professionals", and I must say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always left the Americans in their budgets and production values, a real shame with this film. "Grindhouse", which is unfairly reduced to B (or worse). With a cleaner voice and image, this could have been a success in Hollywood, I think. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) are better than the average, and unlike the "violent professionals", the plot is fairly clear - not many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you love mafia movies or crime movies you should give this one a try. A film about the mob already belongs to Italy (to what extent do you want authenticity?) As far as you can ask. Sure, not "Godfather", but not supposed to be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a thin film with a heavy movement ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, well, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this movie made me want to check out other movies from the director and the lead actor. Films alongside "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual movies. What is more fun than discovering the lost classic?
