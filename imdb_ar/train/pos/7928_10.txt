Let's fix some things first: there's no Zombies movie so the director can make them walk, run, hell to fly if he wants to. This is what makes the original Zombie movie very good. Everything they did was original. I hate it when directors do everything like Romero or when the kids of the fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots believe that the zombie should only grumble like a typical Romero movie, once again there is no zombie so the director can direct the zombie whistle if he wants. All zombies in this film look very good but do not spoil the bodies because they died! They are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was half the cat being eaten. The real curse of my daughter cried when she saw it. This film got really good ratings in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, which made me want to go see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to real horror fan tastes. 10 out of 10! Go rental it!
