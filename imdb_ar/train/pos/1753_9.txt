As we all know that the sub-genre of sex comedy is very crowded. Simply being overly common is not enough anymore. I've seen and heard a lot of disgusting jokes and acts that really need sex comedy to other positive points to appeal to these days. <br /> <br /> When I entered the 40 year old virgin, I basically knew the expectation; I saw commercials after all. "Is it true that if you do not use it, will you lose it?" What I did not expect to find is a heart and sincere attempts at personal development. There are still strange characters "outside the wall" that we often see in Adam Sandler's films and there is still a language that is not suitable enough to sink Noah's Ark. But somehow, the film has a love story that deserves attention and even a message. <br /> <br /> Andy's main character is (unfortunately for me) someone I can contact. In the first shot, I see that he shares my love in Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a movie poster on his wall) and during the film, we see his collection of wonderful effects. Andy also has a lot of video games and a practical knowledge of movies and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most important of all, Andy is a nice person, does not swear and respects women so much that he keeps away from them. Collect all these factors and everyone starts thinking about it as a serial killer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> The other characters each have funny little stories to match their slightly exaggerated characters and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy works. I felt that it was a kind of distraction in some way because Andy and his friend Trish were really the only human character in the entire film. <br /> <br /> I suppose since I mentioned one flaw, one other light has brought him. The story is clever but very predictable and as far as romance goes. It's very simple. He has been dealing with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen in the end. Its final course is certainly a little different from what we might expect, but you know what will happen in the end, and I assure you it will happen. These are definitely small spots in the film, but there are so many good things here that I can easily ignore them, they are a few mistakes. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", I mean "bad" of course. This is a sex comedy and you want to be bad. For the most part I think he succeeded. There are lots of funny scenes like Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene in which Andy goes with his daughter Tric to a sex education class where she ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Ah, we must not soon forget the classic waxing sequence "Ooh! Como se llama!" Interesting little note about this scene. Actor Steve Carell actually waxed his belly and the apparent pain is real. Of course they took only one, but he still had the courage to do his part. <br /> <br /> In fact, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would say that he has now risen on my list of respectable comedians which is strange because I did not even know who he was before watching this film. I was so impressed by the writing, acting and timing that I really wanted to closely monitor his future roles. This man has the talent, the 40-year-old virgin proves. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had doubts about this film, but the early word was positive, and I knew it was something I would eventually see. I'm glad I did this too because it's one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time and doubles in terms of what it feels worth seeing. It is not just a series of sexual gags that are collected together; it is a series of sexual gags associated with a very worthwhile and truly moving romantic character. Now excuse me while I go vomiting. I can not believe I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> My ratings from the Frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
