Wonderful! I've seen lots of bad budget movies lately, but this movie is awesome. The very realistic picture of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime films or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any police cliche. This film is as realistic as documentary and entertaining like drama at the same time. Perfect trade-off!
