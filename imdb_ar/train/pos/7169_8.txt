"Children" films usually have some annoying quality that makes them more happy and unbearable for a person over 13. But again, this is before the holes reach the scene. He certainly has the same moments in which children are often given a film of the above quality, but this film does a good job of keeping away from such agreements. The acting was correct, and Stanley's turbulent dynamics with some of the other camps were more realistic than most films sought to portray. What I particularly like in this film is the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or made you cry. The emotional power was somewhat more natural than most people imagined, a form of Shoshank redemption in several ways (which also includes holes in its compensatory end). The only downside? Lizards looking hokey. Overall, however, 8/10.
