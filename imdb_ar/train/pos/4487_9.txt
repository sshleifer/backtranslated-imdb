"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is a good idea. I liked at least, so I'm surprised that this thing gets mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This story is a horror story rather than a funny story, even though it is comedy moments. The atmosphere is dark and frightening. Thrill is another powerful element here. For humor, humor is often dark. <br /> <br /> In this brief, Tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and feels terrified because it's about ghosts, which he thinks. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry watches everything and can not help but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry soon finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom experiences the most terrifying experience of his whole life. Although Jerry scares Tom for no good reason, the way the story is prepared will become funny. In addition, again, there is no violence here because this is one of the oldest cartoons of Tom & Jerry. However, I do not get Tom's life joke nearly nine in the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally discovered that all this was planned for Jerry and that Jerry had been deceived by him, Jerry "grabbed the hand in the biscuit jar" (worth being discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before responding. He looks angrily at Jerry for a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry calls Tom to laugh with him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him very seriously. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a different experience than Tom and Jerry are wonderful.
