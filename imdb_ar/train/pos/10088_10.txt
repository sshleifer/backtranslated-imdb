Elephant Walk (1954) starring Peter Finch as an early master of the palace in some farms left by God where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen, and stay in the afternoon sun and out. Well in the end, they do it, after the outbreak of typhoid and cholera, of course, a lot of chaos ensuing. Taylor replaced the patient Vivian Lee in this boiler / adventure flick. When the elephants storm the house and lock Liz on the big staircase, I still get goose bumps. Thank God Dana Andrews is about to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
