This German documentary, in English, is a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Gulsworthy. He makes art out of things he finds in nature. For example, early in the film, we see him taking a cross-section of snowflakes and polishing them with some moisture in the form of a serpent that appears to be repeated repeatedly across a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, snowflakes melt, but this speed is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. Goes to one of the sites and feels it, and decides on an intuitive basis what makes it that day. Talks about having a "dialogue" with rocks and other materials that work with them, trying to work * with * instead of against them. They may be stones, flowers, or leaves, or sticks. The statue may last for a few minutes or years, or may not last long enough to complete and photograph. Work seems more than a goal. <br /> <br /> The movie, action, beautiful, inspiring and thought-provoking. It moves very slowly and is suitable for the material, but you should be sure to go when you sleep a good night. But do not hesitate if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the web for some other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about the local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also many books available with pictures for his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My Thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find the meaning of this movie for you completely independently. I remember a few ideas that happened to me while watching the movie I thought I would share with those who still read. First, the temporary nature of many of the works of Andy Goldsworth reminded me of the natural decline and flow of human life. We are born, live and die in the end. This is natural, and it is also a natural part of Goldsworthy art. <br /> <br /> The other thought was supposed to be struck by the way Goldsworthy was able to integrate his passion and work comprehensively into his life. Most of us have a tolerant action at best, a life we ​​hardly notice their presence in life, and the emotions we mean by really spend more time, even if we remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has been able to create a combination of all these aspects of his life that look very good and are nourishing for him and for those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Viewed on 8/2/2002.
