Many young Iranian women wear boys' clothes and try to enter the World Cup qualifier between Iran and Bahrain. When caught, they are placed in an area where the match remains in their ear, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to abandon them, but rules rules. <br /> <br /> Given the proportions of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was acceptable to discover that Offside is a comedy, often a joy. In 1997, "The Mirror", Al-Banna presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which is "real". In 2000, The Circle, several Iranian women went out of the system; their offenses are different, but all end up in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> However, thinking of an Offside now, is hard to imagine as anything other than comedy, because the position it presents is obviously so silly. While women are asking why they can not watch the football match and their captors are struggling to answer, the only possible result is comedy. <br /> <br /> What makes Offside more influential is that young women are not depicted as activists who attack the regime. They are simply fans of football and their patriots, and despite the fact that they are treated unfairly, they do not lose their focus on the game and the historic victory that falls under their nation.
