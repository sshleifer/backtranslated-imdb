This is a real "80" film: at that time they produced 100 times more films than we do today, making many of them interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Nowadays, the same kind of people who would make inexpensive "cheap to video" movies in the 1980s may be doing cheap movies. It seems porn for sale. Anyway, this is higher than the level of medium trash: it's a wonderful and fun story, and I think it's very good. In one scene, you can see the microphone swinging on the top edge of the picture. Of course, there are also a few films by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the film "Success", although they are good in their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammy Core", looks very horrible, especially when he sings. One of the coolest monsters I have ever seen in spells of terror. I may face his nightmares the next night. Not recommended for lovers of intellectual films.
