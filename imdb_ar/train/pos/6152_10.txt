Fabulous, wonderful, and perhaps the best Disney musical adventure. I have loved this film for more than 35 years because it is very creative, intelligent and fun. Despite the silly "Flying Bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialogue are magical and funny. Could they have chosen anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglanten? I can not think of anyone more suited to this role. Re-making these classics would be as stupid as re-making Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he has a few good film roles, only shines in this adventure. He was a genius who is often forgotten these days. Explosion, an Ole and a suitable English man - no one can do a jerk and pull him safely as he does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson died a few years ago and no one could get into his shoes and bring justice to his character. <br /> <br /> Sleeping gowns and shields have a magical halo than other films with witches just do not pick up. I especially enjoy the parts in which the Germans invade the house of Eglantine and have to defend it in any way possible. <br /> <br /> They sway together and sway in the beautiful beautiful seabed. Richard and Robert Sherman outperform musical numbers. They are all wonderful and worth remembering, Portobello Rod is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie continues to this day !!
