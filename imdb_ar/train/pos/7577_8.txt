Who got gold? (Unfortunately) is the last HANZO THE RAZOR, Shintaro Katsu as the title - the highly skilled samurai officer in the field of multiple weapons and the "unique" technique of raping confessions from unwitting informants until the bean leaks and begging for more ... <br /> <br /> This entry starts with "Hanzo" to reveal a woman pretending to be a ghost to guard a lake filled with bamboo trunks filled with stolen gold from the Treasury. This leads to the discovery of Hanzo's plan to collect loans and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. So read the required fencing and rape / questioning - finalize a decent end to this quirky trilogy of films. <br /> <br /> It is not very strong and fun like THE SNARE (Part 2 of the series ...), but it's still great for the realtor's hobbies and the pinky Japanese movies. 10/08
