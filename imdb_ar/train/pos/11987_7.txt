Since a few years have passed since my review of this classic film, I decided to go back and review it more in the section, but first some internal comments from a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with, made my childhood happy, it made it great, I miss some of these things today, obviously we do not see as much as we did in the last days, until the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte, dubbed in Denmark is a wonderful cartoon series, they are very similar to the wafer and dale, and a lot of those old ones, so they have a strange feeling surrounding them, and I can not Remember this series as much as I want to remember. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it was very wonderful, it came with a type of message, not a land message, but this old message can even be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to look anything old or anything, but I feel that the time has slipped from my hands with these drawings, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else that weird, These new or almost new offers like Hannah Montana or something like that, however I feel like I do not have the same spirit in real drawings or programs as we did in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now I may be wrong but I feel that the time has changed considerably, to conclude that I would be thrilled to see these serials like the version of Talespin again on TV instead of all those new ones, give me cartoons in my childhood, Give it to the kids I have one day, give them back ...
