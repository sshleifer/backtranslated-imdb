A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after his death in an accident. She barely settled in this small town, but soon after, she lost her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This can lead to all the following types of plots in a normal film: find a new partner and happiness in the end; or depressed enough to struggle And eventually killed herself ... She is trying to kill herself, but not after a series of intense battles, with God. She trusts in God, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I have to be careful here about God, the film does not mean anything against God. The way the film deals with the issue is very interesting: not from the perspective of women or from the perspective of God (and in this way, there will be a lot of growing weeds, clouds flying views, I suppose). Instead, from the point of view of a third party, the film allows us to imagine and make nothing clear. <br /> <br /> The movie would not be very fun if there were only a woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman who is obviously in love with her, but in his own way. It's a funny man, like a joker I would say, who shamelessly hovers around our heroine. A combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and always ejaculating, the man, smiling and stupidly speaking, ends up with a good balance in feelings: nothing is terribly wrong or too boring. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend.
