I saw this movie on TV when it appeared, and I did not see it again. For my life, I could not remember the title and stumbled upon it while checking the credits of Roy Thinne. Horror film in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and "Devil School for Girls", lost all satanic classicism. I also think it has many similarities with classic Clint Eastwood, "High Plains Drifter." Why not make these great little movies, especially when you think of all the more recent waste that fills the reduced DVD shelves in Wal-Mart? Most of these clicks have a cult, so sales should not be a problem.
