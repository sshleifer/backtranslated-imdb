This movie works because it feels very real. The story is simple and realistic, as it captures the joys and concerns of adolescent love and sexual activity that most of us have lived through during our teenage years. <br /> <br /> The actors are just as natural as the characters in the documentary film but are as convincing and attractive as veteran performers. Dialogue is new and sincere ... Thank God has not been filled so far with the references of pop culture nice. The cinema at the same time is beautiful and wonderful, bringing life back to the lower eastern side in a very concrete way. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, I like this film because it reminds me of the new Italian wonderful real-life films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Films rarely feel as "real" as they do ... or as did Bicycle Thief. The only other film I have seen treats teen sex with the same level of seriousness is the magnificence of Elijah Kazan in the grass. Writer / Director Peter Solit deserves tremendous praise. This film is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I am always happy to see a film that treats members of ethnic origin with love and respect. As an American Italy, I hate the way my people go in the movies (genosani, geniuses, geniuses, criminals in disturbing popular annexes), and my aggravation in this number makes me feel very sensitive to other groups and their terrible silver screen agencies. It seems that Latins and Asians are particularly cursed to play villains in the West and motion movies. (The good thing that Gong Lee did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks to the emergence of independent images and the impact of Miramax, we are seeing some additional images about the ethnic figures here and there ... But the elevation of Victor Vargas is easily One of the best. Although I was really impressed with my big wedding party in Greece, it was a refreshing change as Raising Victor Vargas played straight (with less exaggerated and widely painted characters) while still very funny in and of itself. finally! Latin characters worth noting. I have a feeling that this film will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, after making this wonderful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollett will make a film about the Italians soon! :) - Mark Dibolo
