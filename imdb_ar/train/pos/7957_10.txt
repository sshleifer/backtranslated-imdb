Guys, <br /> <br /> I was looking everywhere to find these two films and I can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I am Australian). Could you please help me and tell me where I can buy it from. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was five, and it's still so far when I was a teenager. It's a great movie for the entire family. My whole family loved this film except for my younger sister because I saw him many times that she was sick of him. I love this movie and I can not wait until I can buy it back on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
