Can anyone buy this movie? My uncle Hatch was a real pilot (not a pulley). He was seen throwing his wings into the air and then snatching them with his fist as he got the wings of his pilot. <br /> <br /> It's only on the screen for a few seconds but my family likes to get the movie. He was killed in a fierce battle with Italy, and was only 24 years old at the time. Do you know the film studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen it in a video store, like Blockbuster? I hope they will make full catalogs of these old movies because they are very cheap to provide DVDs these days. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. thank you.
