MacArthur is a wonderful movie with a wonderful story about a great man? General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, is the story of one of the great American military figures, and a figure that has become familiar to me from the first moments in my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be other problems), for example, MacArthur's filmed speech did not include his 1962 address to the US Military Academy about accepting the Thayer Award "old soldiers never die; They are only fading. " (In his address to Congress when he was ousted by President Truman) in 1951 because of his alleged rebellion (these two people did not see face to face!) Gregory Beck is capable of Im Beck as a general who has vowed to return to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II to the end of his career in service. This film will be much more important for a film familiar with World War II and the Korean War. However, Pic's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated the war as a soldier only is unforgettable. "In war there is no alternative to victory."
