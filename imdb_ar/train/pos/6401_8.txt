Honor men have many wonderful aspects to it. Good work sequences, a lot of "feel good" scenes, a good musical result, but the part that makes the film really is the great acting. Mostly Robert Deniro. The story of the honorary men is centered around Carl Prascher, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American submarine in the deep sea. He recounts his fierce struggle from being a poor farmer to entering a diving school and even further afield. It's a good story, but it seems to have been implemented many times before. No one will give up, despite all odds, to achieve the goals he has set for a passionate reason for many years. This may happen, but many of the struggles faced by Brashear in the film are questionable including C.O. From a scuba diving school with its final test. However, it is all set for the scene when Robert Deniero finally enters the film. Deniro plays Mather Schiff Sunday as a teacher at the Prairie Diving School. Once Deniro comes, he overlooks this arrogance of arrogance that you can not hate unless you have incredible power. Before the film ends, Dinero delivers multiple speeches that will make you laugh over how terrified you are, but you are very surprised by the way he hits them. In the end, you have to suspect some aspects of the film, but you admit it, if the truth is complete, you'll fall asleep in your first twenty minutes.
