Watch this on Star World's overseas network that buys US and Canadian serials that last for a season or two like The Jane Show. I thought about the number of female comedies that can watch Im really able to watch alone, there's Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream Of Jeanie (the movie with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes a bit of a vacuum I can not think of anyone else, Roles and not leadership. For me, the Jin Fair in a good company. One thing I thought about though. I've seen several things made in Canada, and I never remember anything being filmed in a regular television show showing SNOW! All are made in summer peak, lol! It is recognized as a great place to live in the summer, but you will think that it will appear a little bit of Canada in the winter because this is part of the lifestyle there as well. I mean, SCTV, just for laughter comes to mind as long comedy shows filmed in Canada and were not filmed very little or none of them were filmed with the presence of snow although they do a lot of external shots. But I found it on an equal footing with a British series called The IT Crowd (I think) comedy office with female leadership. It's by no means the best comedy at all, but the man can say he can see it alone, and that's something to say. If you are with my wife, you may really enjoy it because it has sex in the office, and such things may be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 of 10.
