Very wonderful, very quirky, very romantic, very Italian. The film is very feathery, as it floats into its broken reality and does not want to go back to wet again. The world of kitchen drowns from bakeries, hairdressers, plumbing, but one shines with fine gloss. Should credit go to a scenario or direction? Choose what you want - both without errors. Let me go back to New York City which is behind the glass.
