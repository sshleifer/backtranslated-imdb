Stage adaptations often have a big error. They often appear as if a movie camera was simply placed on the stage (such as "Night Mother"). The direction of Sydney Lumette keeps the film alive, which is very difficult because the picture has not given him any real challenge. Still, it's good to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Kane and Christopher Reeve is very impressive. The dynamics of their relationship are surprising. Cayenne is as wonderful as always, and Reef has one of his few chances of acting really. <br /> <br /> I confess I have never seen Ira Levin play, but I hear that Jay Bryson's adaptation of Allen is locked. The script is incredibly complex and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is a massive entertainment movie, and is recommended for all theater fans and screeners. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
