Perhaps the soprano was the last show to be broadcast in the 1990s. It's sad that it ended, it was the best show on HBO if it was not on TV, and everything was not explained for you throughout the thinking period, it was fantastic. The cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a wonderful actor and has played his excellent character as well as others. Each character was flawed and this made it very real and allowed viewers to communicate with them and this is one reason that went on for a long time. The last episode was good, and I'm not sure how to take it. Many different things can be explained by the endpoint, such as the belief that Tony did not die but walked the lawns and sat with them and that the blackout was just a thriller. Tony will have to go to trial and deal with it, hopefully this is not what I feel ... Live Soprano and Tony Soprano .......
