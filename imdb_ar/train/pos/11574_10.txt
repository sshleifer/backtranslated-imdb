This film is a documentary ... it is interesting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good film ... based on the real story of how a handful of Norwegian terrorists managed to stop heavy water production in Rockian, The rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and may be a little better ... The best part of the movie is that some saboteurs are playing themselves !!! <br /> <br /> If you're interested in the history of World War II and film, this is a movie worth watching !!
