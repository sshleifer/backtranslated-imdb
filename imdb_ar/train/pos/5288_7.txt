This fun cartoonist Bugs Bunny sees Marvin the Martian's unnamed return along with his friend K-9 Green Dog. <br /> <br /> This time instead of trying to destroy Earth Marvin on a mission to land, pick up the Earth creature and restore it to Mars. Of course the creature he chose is Bugs Bunny. Initially, Bugs believes that Marvin and K-9 are either tricked or manipulated but realize that this can not be true when Marvin widens the hole of the Bug rabbit radically with a radiator. Bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in several ways, including convincing Marvin that K-9 is planning a rebellion. Eventually he was caught using the Acme strait jacket expelled from the bazooka. Surprisingly, for the Acme product, it works as advertised and Bug's is forced to use his intelligence to get the K-9 to release him, the tables are running soon and the disgruntled Merykhans are banging and Bugs tries to bring the back dish back to earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this even though the end is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed slightly here and became emotionally visible when he was angry, but that did not make me like him or the animation less than that.
