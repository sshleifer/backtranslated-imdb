Bell and Book and Candle were one of the great phenomena of pop culture in the mid-20th century. They are very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the 1970s - more than a decade later - there are still endless references to this film). He made Novak a great star, put a nice element on Jack Lemon's resume, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore their careers (both continued to play witches and other bizarre bats in cinema and television) <br /> <br /> In addition to the 1940's "I Married a Witch" (which helped make Veronica Lake a symbol), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great movie and TV with all the charming things that started with Bewitched and continued through Practical Magic Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Rarely do I see that he noticed that the film is also an Xmas film rather interesting alternative. Story events during the Christmas holiday, despite the fact that they relate to magic, they actually embody a great deal of Christmas spirit (tenderness, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (I've seen it several times since it premiered in the early 1990s), especially if it was shown around or immediately after the holiday season. Like Adam's Rib, he casually expresses the ideas that were radically radical for his time, and so far radical (in both films, the female character is guilty and powerful), and so always seems before the times.
