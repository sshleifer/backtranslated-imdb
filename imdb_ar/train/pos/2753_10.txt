My favorite film of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but this movie beats them all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. You, as a "natural" care person begin to love George. Although a representative, he is also a very lovable person. The maby is the most important thing: you will learn respect and look different from people with Down syndrome.
