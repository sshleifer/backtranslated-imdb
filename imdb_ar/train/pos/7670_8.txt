I really enjoyed Dr. Murdred. This is a low-budget film, and may be uncertain for some, but I have no problem with that. I'm so impressed by that, considering it is more fun than the driving produced by Hollywood every year. Too bad this did not get a theatrical version; I do not know anyone else, but I was going to see it in the theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very interesting science fiction film that anyone can enjoy, especially if it's in science fiction like me. I do not see why this R movie is said to be just one word, there are no horrific scenes of death, and there is no blood at all. The immortal rivalry between entrants Anton and Kabal (Antoine wanted to use his powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them) gave the story a sense of magic, while the legendary planner added the magic of the story itself. Basically, this movie is just fun to watch. There's one funny thing unintentional in this film, however: seeing Jeffrey Combs is keeping his face straight while wearing a mysterious blue head dress. This makes me laugh every time I see her. In any case, the acting is wonderful; the main protagonists (Anton, and his girlfriend Samantha), very lovable; Anton sympathetic and hospitable, Samantha's girlfriend. In addition, the settings were great. The floating island in the other dimension was a very wonderful setting. We only gave a glimpse twice, it was great to see more scenes here. The main setting was also very neat. Anton's apartment is very spacious and has some wonderful equipment, especially the surveillance system it uses to track events in the world. He even has a pet crow that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar. Overall, this is a wonderful movie. It was fun to watch, and the lead actors were very much in their roles. If you can find any place where Dr. Mourred is renting, you have to rent it (or in my case, buy it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars from ten. <br /> <br />
