There is a dire social situation from the disaster: it ended up that poor Giovanna had ended in the bottom, but still had an impact: beauty and youth. Bragana, a light-hearted gas station tenant, who was years ago, takes her out of the street and displays her bed and her house with his clumsy tenderness. But the physical contact with Giovanna now only gives her a sense of revulsion, so she does not see any usefulness in it, but a torment she has to get rid of. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally gives her the long-awaited opportunity. You do not have to ask her twice: in her first encounter, you give him a feeling that he is physically desirable, and after a while allow him to seduce her without any resistance. <br /> <br /> The development partnership must be subject to the strict rules set by Giovanna nonetheless. Gino's longing for freedom is suppressed, and his desire to leave the place with Giovanna is abandoned and a new life begins to go away from the courtyard. Giovanna aims to another goal: the killing of Prajana, inherited, in addition, collection premium. In her hands Gino turns into a self-sacrifice tool. Being at the mercy of this woman turns into a killer in cold blood. <br /> <br /> Unlike Giovanna, however, he doubts the crime committed on the moral level. The seizure of the place of Prajana, which includes sleeping on the bed of a dead man, causes deep hatred for him. Later, after learning about the anticipated payment of the insurance money and apparently seeing through Giovanna's innovative plan, he also performs a physical separation from his lover and finds rest in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <br /> If Visconti is finished at this stage, it can easily be categorized as a condemnation of a wonderful, sensitive and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then, recent sequences cause the collapse of this carefully designed structure of ideas. In the end, Giovanna feels remorse for what she has done, and the firm revelation of her deeper feelings that are fueling Geno's love again. Her violent death by a ridiculous road accident, leaving him not only helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. It also affects us, while we recognize that no responsible person will be assigned responsibility for the disaster. The culprit is simply the state of the society that determines the path of the individual properly from the beginning. <br /> <br />
