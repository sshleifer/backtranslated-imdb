The 18 directors had the same task: to recount love stories in Paris. Of course, some are better than others, but the whole mosaic is charming - besides, is not it boring if they all have the same vision of love? <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin," written by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the best French actors managed my favorite collection at all , Featuring Gina Rowlands and Ben Butcher. Clever and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel," by Sylvain Chumit <br /> <br /> A visually appealing and stunning story (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") for a young boy whose parents were mingling; <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Cowen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", by Alfonso Quarron ("Y" Tu Mamá También "," Children's Men "), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludwig Sainte (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz. Seydou Boro and Issa Mayga (touch); <br /> <br /> 6. "The Fourteenth Congress", Alexander Payne ("The Elections", "About Schmidt") A wonderful look on the pathetic side of life is here, feat. Actress Margo Martindale (the mother of Hilary Swank in "Million Dollar Child") as a single middle-aged American woman on vacation; Voborg San Denis and Run Lola Run ") frantic on the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind young man (Melchior Beslon) falls in love; 8." Bear Laches "by Wes Craven. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (as well as a curious veil from Alexander Pine as Oscar Wilde); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas The talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" by Olivier Assayas ("Clean") is a sad, sad story. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, Gaspar Orel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Feethbul (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. " Cartier de la Madeleine "by Vincenzo Natale. Elia Wood and Olga Corelino; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nubuhiro Sawa. Juliette Pinochet and Willem Dafoe; "The Pastels" by Isabelle Kext (great director of "My Life Without Me"). Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellito, Javier Camara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle", by Richard Lagrafines. Bob Hosskins and Fanny Ardant; 17. "Montmartre", through and with Bruno Baudalidis; 18. "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder ("Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I can classify some sectors as fantastic and other average (or even a bit boring), but not one of them is obviously bad. On the whole, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" 8.5 / 10 and recommend what it is: a beautiful mosaic of love and other things between them.
