One of my favorite films I saw was in the preview in Seattle. Tom Hols was amazing, where words can convey his / her thoughts. Mike Veril has actually sent some donations to help get the film. it is good. The system says I need more lines, but I do not want to give up the conspiracy stuff. I was in Seattle attending with Hollis and the director, a writer I think and Mike Veril. They talked for about an hour. Not really dry eye at home. Why Hollywood is still stupid and I do not know. (Actually I know, it's our fault, look at what we're seeing) Well, you'll get what you pay for the men. Get this and see it with someone special. It's a gem.
