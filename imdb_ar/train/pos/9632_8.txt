The concept of the presence of Laurel and Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweeps works surprisingly hilarious. It ensures some ridiculous and ridiculous and ridiculous situations, especially Stan Laurel's course as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also contains a sub-plan with Professor Josie working on a renewal combination. This does not really seem to be a logical mix of storylines and incoherent, but both lines of the plot blend perfectly into the unforgettable ending. It's still a little strange but funny though, so it works for the film. <br /> <br /> The amazing film is amazingly good. Sam Adams is wonderful because the typical server and Lucian Littlefield excel beautifully as Professor Josie. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with some excellent serials built in time, which are all predictable to become hilarious to watch however thanks to the way all are performed. All this helps to make "dirty work" one of the best shorts for Laurel and Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
