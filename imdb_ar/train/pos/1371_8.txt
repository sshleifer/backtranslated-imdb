This film is a delightful and exhilarating look on both sides of the scene where the "club kid" is intermingled with the worlds of art, music and performing arts in New York (with a veil by Miss Bunn everywhere). This is a "triple song torch" for the teenage fun girls. "That Girl" for our sarcastic and damaged times of the millennium. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and funny, and the designer of Parker Bossi - if not the Academy Award - deserves a "playground" of games. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film follows the very stylish Miss Busy platform, which is quite popular. Much like her acting representative, may not be too deep, often a reference to self, as well ... but it all works. She is a talented comedian, and a wonderful entertainer, and this movie entertains, as she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard, and do not let her fall to the ground. <br /> <br /> Mary is a fashion designer for surface parties. Who is not above stealing clothing designed from a friend's closet or going out with a friend to someone else. On a deeper level, this is the story of a girl and her friends who care about the full meaning of the word, including about others; and the learning process that care is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully designed, clever, and the only performance that disappoints is the aunt, in the role he was one-dimensional and extremely heavy-handed; a more accurate performance of her, would deepen the relationship between the two ... But ... hey ... this is a comedy. An amazingly deep role, this film gives some substance and universal vision, is a friend selling falafel. We must all be lucky ... Is it one for Mary? Or those that go unpunished? <br /> <br /> This is based on 8 because this is not a great moment in the history of the film, it is not a classic and it is not a great art (and it all gets deeper and richer in re-viewing). Such as "The Pursuit of Susan", it represents something very real about the time period, but it may become irrelevant to time. Still, it contains everything that an entertaining movie needs, and worth watching several times for clothes alone!
