I can not agree more with the quote "This is one of the best films ever produced." If you think Vanilla Sky is simply "remake", you can not be more mistaken. There is a tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and sometimes sensitive (early scenes with Sophia) and at other times intense and intense (Times Square), post-climate scenes). <br /> <br /> The music and sounds in this movie are completely connected. Without music, the story is listed only half. Nancy Wilson designed an emotional, but selective, score for a film that could not be more suited to a dream-like theme (although never released, I managed to get my hand on the original score for about $ 60.), You might be able to find a copy by yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also ideal for the film. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (ie love, grief, regret) are extremely powerful, and magnified by ten times through visual and musical experience, as well as a genius dialogue; admit that the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes Repeatedly. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this movie (as if it could improve) is that it was so cleverly designed that each made when you watch the movie, you will pick up something new - so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, the subject becomes clear after the first or second viewing, but there is always a story more than you think. <br /> <br /> This is the best work for Cameron Crow easily, and it's a great job. Much of my cinematic work and musical inspiration come from this work alone. I really touched my life, because real art has a tendency to do it. It surprises me constantly that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I think understanding real art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in its own association.
