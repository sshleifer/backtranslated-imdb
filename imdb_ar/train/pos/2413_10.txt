I love the TV show. I was hooked the first time I saw it. I wish I were there acting with them. It touches the reality when you love someone and think about wanting to spend the rest of your life with him, then the events that meet someone else and that person is more than you want to be with him. You are in a position you had to choose one or another. Someone will hurt, there is no stopping it. Making a decision is difficult, but do you want to continue dissatisfaction when you can. Why do you continue and live a life you thought you wanted or thought you were doing right and you were unhappy. This other person will not wait a lifetime waiting, they have a good life. Making the decision you really want will be better in the end. Make the most of what you have a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc. .... do not make you happy, because there is the only person you want to be with him to participate in it.
