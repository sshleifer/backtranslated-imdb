I was very impressed with this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most expensive thing! This is a very small girl. Her acting was fantastic as well. True in life and very human. Although I do not like the part that she smoked in; I hope it is just a fake prop. In either case, it was very impressive and the story was very impressive. I found myself immersed in the story and its personality. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting how I came to discover this film already. I was walking in a very smooth film and I noticed that I noticed her beautiful smile on the cover while walking. Fortunately, I looked at the downward trend of this film! I thought to myself, "Awe, look at it!" So I picked him up and saw that this film had been described as wonderful things like "little gem". I read the plot on the back then I thought it, well, maybe I'll look for it on IMDb first and then go back and rent it later. I'm glad I did not do it, because I certainly would have been lost. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew I would be sorry because I did not rent this movie, so I went back to where I originally found it and picked it up. <br /> <br /> I had been wearing my clothes for a week, since I started school this week and had no time to watch it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. Popped into it, and were glued in beautiful cinematography, the fun result and animated plot from start to finish. I was very impressed and I have to say that some parts made me cry. <br /> <br /> I would also like to refer specifically to the little boy in this film, Juan Jose Balista. It was awesome. Also the actor who played the role of Carol's father, who unfortunately is not included in the site. His voice was so loving and gentle that I could feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not prominent, I really felt his personality. <br /> <br /> It's a really wonderful movie. If you're a light-affected person, but emotional films, that's definitely one for you.
