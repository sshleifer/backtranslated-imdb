* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticism (representation, dialogue dated, unclear story) unfounded. Belafonte is as wonderful as the spirit of Brandok, a threat and a right-wing who must win his wings but is unrealistic and unfit in his previous life to do so. He learns too late how his life was full of life free of love. Mostel is as great as a tormented man with his deceased wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, the bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. The social worlds represented by the characters represent a mutual clash and complement each other, and the result is fun and sad. <br /> <br /> The puzzling ending is perfectly consistent with the rest of the movie. After searching everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks for a falling feather and reaches frantically as if he is finally ready to believe in angels and miracles. But Bellavonte was not allowed to complete a miracle (either to restore the health of Fanny or the faith of Mostel), so he never got his wings. The shuttle is brilliantly floated by Mostel's fist, a metaphor for both men: it is too late and will not get a second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is enchanting, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
