This movie got awesome ratings from everyone who voted here but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres My Car and Dumb and Dumber, this movie is for you. If you have movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca Casablanca you should succeed at a different angle. However, I still love this film and everything that it has to do, even if it is a kind of "childish", this is one of the few films I have been able to watch and my friends have been able to watch over the years and quote whenever possible. Great movie. This movie should be the number of AFIs because the class is too high of friggin. The only problem with this movie is that you might have trouble watching it because it was made for a TV movie on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, Id want to buy it for the DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still press it from the first time, you can go out if you like and watch it but I may be asleep. This rock movie is all that you need to know.
