What does Marquez de Sade have to do with the Egyptian antiquities and the mermaid cult? Tobe Hooper is trying to answer this question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Jenny is a young girl who visits her nervous, nervous father in Alexandria, Egypt. The genie is caught with a mysterious whore (and a stark lesbian) who serves the father on the side. Papa is returned to the site, where he discovers a tomb that looks like a mermaid. Jenny meets one of the descendants of Marquis de Sade, and encounters a pariah Egyptian (who presents the most important scenes of the film). In the end, Jenny discovered that it would be a sacrifice and that the long bloody peak would continue. Wrapped around this story are the footage of Marquis de Sade in prison, talking to a picture of what looks like Jenny. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is as great as Marquis and his descendants. His acting abilities have always been influenced by makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors, including the young Jenny, are beautiful and mediocre. The scenario, however, is a problem. You will quickly learn that Marquis scenes are absolutely unnecessary, except perhaps the filmmakers have managed to reach the wonderful collection. The mermaid cult that ultimately saves Jenny is meaningless at all. Who is the mermaid has never been explained, and linking it to Christianity (which is filmed during the film) is nothing. The film is hostile to Christians, as the archeologist is a father who speaks the Bible, but likes to be constrained by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of corruption and violence, but Hopper may have a small idea of ​​what the scriptwriter is trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why would I recommend this film? It's strange. There is an expanded sex scene. For ladies, the Egyptian horseback riding is completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This film is full of them. This is like Roger Kurman with a larger budget. Knowing Hooper came in somehow with the Crocodile after this is somewhat sad. "Night terrors" are not perfect, but they certainly deserve a peek and a vague. <br /> <br /> This (R) is classified as physical violence, some sexual violence, tumor, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sex content, sexual references, and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
