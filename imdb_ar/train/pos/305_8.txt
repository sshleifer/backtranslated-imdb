Broolbol is a comedy about romantic mismatch in New York City. It is clear that Peter Bogdanovich loves all women in his image - he sanctifies them - yet Audrey Hepburn (naturally) puts a higher degree than others because she is, after all, Princess Bogdanovich, whom she may have liked in films 30 years ago. Shot in a close, grainy image, her right in the sheets between her and the wonderful butcher's son boiled boiled butcher, and allows her room to shine all the time. The love relationships made during the film are fast and entertaining, although I was tired of John Titter's TV-style words. Colin Camp, Dorothy Stretten, and Patty Hansen's earthy surface are all thrilling to watch. But it's really Valentine's Day in Hepburn and it's completely flaming. *** from ****
