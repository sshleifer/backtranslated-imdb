I watched the babysitter as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult classics (Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie features a lot of stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rockers, bikers, lesbians, sexual abuse, blackmail, and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> Key actors are doing credible work. She found the intricately woven plot to be credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the support team, especially the drivers, offers flexible performance, especially when asked to provide lines in more than a few words. Maybe they used real cyclists rather than actors. Some personalities, in particular, were exceptionally reliable. <br /> <br /> The musical score is perfectly spotty, in times, rhythm, and to move the story forward. I found the music a real pleasure. I noticed in the opening credits that the film introduced the music "The Food". But, I could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, Carrie, who wrote and starred in this film, was impressed by the idea of ​​a lost married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulations, and a simple help - of course - which he wrote and produced a starring role in "Weekend with the Babysitter."
