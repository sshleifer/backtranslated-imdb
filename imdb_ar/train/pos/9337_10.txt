This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than American series, but this time the authors achieved the right goal by creating a smooth mix. Edel & Starck is great, it has everything: brilliant lines, clever, clever, always well-executed, and an amazing theatrical timing shown by all the stars and beautiful stills in Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is interesting to see how things are going on in justice in countries other than the United States of America, and for the time being "feeling" about Europe's old way of dealing with life. Glory to all actors and crew for a good comedy film will be necessary to see it in the coming years. Watching the series in German is great.
