The movie Kung Fu is entertaining, with acting, plot and anti-viewer cut above average sock seal. All cast are talented characters and skilled military artists. Alien in the comedy Alexander Fu Xing Proto Jackie Chan is fun to watch, and shows his fellow Trimmer skills particularly impressive. For me, the only drawback in the film is the size of the cast - sometimes things get a bit confused because the film's segments change and change between the different sub-charts, and some characters are not as full of flesh as one would like. <br /> <br /> But Kung Fu must be judged first and foremost on the quality of the movement, and certainly the Shaolin Temple recognizes in this regard. The climax of the film with a high battle count allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, Shaolin Temple is a fun, low-budget kung fu movie. Not good quality Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for lovers of this genre. My estimate: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous Notes: The Warner Home Video that I saw in 1987 (expected) was poorly dubbed, lacking the credits of the team and the entire crew.
