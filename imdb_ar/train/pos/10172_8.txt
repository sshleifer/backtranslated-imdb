Friz Freleng 'Rumors' is a special cartoon that Snafu excels from spreading rumors of panic during the war. Like all Snafu shorts, "Rumors" has been produced to be shown to the military audiences as entertaining educational films. It is very creative and captures many ideas in its very short life. When Snafu begins to rumor about the bombing, it escalates into a rumor that America has finally lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated through a long piece of rubber rubber and many exotic and fictional creatures that have come back to haunt Snafu with more terrible news about his army. "Rumors" are creative, fast-paced and funny, all helping the tyranny of the message "do not offend the army." It stands as one of the best Snafu shorts.
