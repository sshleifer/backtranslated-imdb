There are a few comedies like this, where almost every line and every personality comes close to flaws. This is funny soooo !! She has a lot of irony there. Sally Field tops the truly distinguished cast and performs a good, if not ideal, work with the daytime TV singer. Sometimes their representation is fairly simple and exceeds the maximum, but 90% of the time is riots! In the same league is Kevin Klein and Robert Downey Jr. and Bobby Goldberg (who unfortunately do not have much to do here). Downey Jr. may not be quite convinced that he is a comedian and does not have a proper timing all the time, but he is struggling for his part which is, to be honest, the most sad. But the brightest star here is Cathay Moriarty like Celeste, the real bitch if there is one with more than a bad secret (you'll see in the very stunning end!). Unfortunately Elizabeth Shui does not seem to be very comfortable in her side. I usually love Ms. Shue, but she acts like a fish out of the water, and sometimes she appears in a different film. But it is not harmful, and at least most are sufficient. Otherwise, it is full of memorable lines and attitudes, it's a comedy to watch when it's on TV or anywhere.
