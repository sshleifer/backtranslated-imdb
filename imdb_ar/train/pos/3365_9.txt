Special day (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Once upon a time she faced a film that really touched a nerve. This one offers a very simple hypothesis, performed almost flawlessly in all ways and moving incredibly at the same time. Surprisingly, Ituri Scholler's Ituri Scola is relatively unworthy, so he hates some critics. It is called "Time Out", "Garbage" and Leonard Maltin, somewhat mild, "gentle but absurd." I disagree, not only because the film is moving deeply, but in its simple story we have more insights into everyday life in Fascist Italy than most of the films I have seen. The cinematography is not clearly clear, it is rather bland, and the story is clear, which may explain the relatively unpopularity of the film. Given that the audience of the late 1970s was not fully conversant with great Italian films, it is strange that this film has not really been criticized. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 10-minute collection of archive archives from Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Against this backdrop, we met Antonita (Lauren), a single housewife full of love with six children in a Romanian residential building . One day, when Beo runs away, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be the only one in the building who does not attend the celebrations. He is courteous, cultured, and soon attracted to him. Throughout the film, we hear the march of fascism from the radio of the concierge, who walks around the courtyard. Scola uses the camera playfully to make us part of the procedure. After the opening scene, the camera hovers through the courtyard of a modern (very modern) apartment building, and seems to be looking for our main characters, which we have not met yet. <br /> <br /> Marcelo Mastrianiani and Sophia Lorraine are not forgotten in the leadership roles, and they are amazing because they are completely opposed to writing. Canadian-born John Vernon plays the role of Lauren's husband, but only appears on screen in the first and last scene. I think his voice should be dubbed, because he is not of Italian origin and has never lived there, as far as I know, so I can not imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice is dubbed, I will not notice at all. On the contrary, it is quite believable as an Italian, even more than the rest of the actors. The story is simple but very effective, the performances are fantastic, the end is just perfect and the frame does not pay off excessively, but it works perfectly. Do not miss this. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
