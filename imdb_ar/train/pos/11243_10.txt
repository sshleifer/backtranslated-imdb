I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980 ... I loved it then and after it just caught it in August 2005 on a Canadian station, it's still wonderful. The only thing I regret is that I can not find the audio track or DVD in the stores? ... anyone interested in throwing some light or should I ask a high-priced Internet company. But with the return to the film, the music stands in the test of time. Hazel / Kate had what she said about Britain in the 1980s ... She was actually the same decade she moved to Canada for some of the same reasons, being Thatcher and what she was doing in the country at that time. Please if you got a chance to watch this movie you will not be sorry!
