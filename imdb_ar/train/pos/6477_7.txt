"Five Days" is considered a special feature, a criminal drama consisting of a series of episodes, each set on a particular day of police investigations. But in fact, this element of the story seems less important than initially thought, because the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours can not be observed, and the program does not distinguish much from others. Crime Stories. In fact, one can not help making comparisons with the last "master suspect," where one of the sub plots focuses on a cynical one approaching retirement: not just Helen Mirren, who makes comparisons unfavorable. There is a lot of serious passion and bold music and a host of seemingly intrusive characters so that everyone is somewhat sympathetic with someone else suspicious. The culprit can be guessed long before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the story, but because of the construction of drama as a whole: some things must be real, to justify the way the series focuses on certain characters at certain times. Despite these failures, the series grew on me: in the end, I was very disappointed. But this is a sad sign that the BBC, which was made by the likes of The Singing Detective, boasted of "perhaps the best drama of the year": because there is little real authenticity presented here, and the prosecution reveals a lack of ambition that It is frighteningly disappointing. "Five days" is not really nonsense. But it is equivalent, and one hopes that the best that the BBC offered would be something more creative and innovative.
