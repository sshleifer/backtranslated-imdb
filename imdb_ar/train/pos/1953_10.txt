Since this film was based on a true story of a woman with two children and was not in a good position, it was very scary for the truth of the matter! Representation is what gave the film that pushed to greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton portrayed the main character, Patsy McCartl, who gave birth to two children. Her performance is what makes the real life story appear on television. It was very hard to see some scenes because they were pretty real to what happens when you become addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just watching this very loving mother turns from sweet to uninterested was at all difficult but it is true I knew the people who passed the withdrawal and was very similar to what happened in this film, which I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a film of what happened to this woman. However it was done well. I salute the director because he produced this film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone who knows someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to knowing what can happen to you if you become addicted to it. .
