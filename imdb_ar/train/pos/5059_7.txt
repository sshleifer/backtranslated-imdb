We watched a video and found it wonderful. I do not know anything about this real story, I thought: "Oh, no, Brosnan as an American Indian (Indian" red "in the film), what a bad choice" until Gray discovered the first. The film does a good job of showing the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermining racist myths about them. Annie Gallipo, F., who is a beauty, and very convincing as an Indian woman (I think she is French Canadian; she certainly goes back to such a very familiar speech). Despite Brosnan's separate style, and snoring, he finally appears convincingly as an emotional and dedicated man. This plot is somewhat weak in removing its transformation from hunter to animal world. Good movie, highly recommended.
