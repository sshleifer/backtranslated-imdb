Chaos of the species, but they are mainly based on Stephen Chow's stunning models for their inspiration. There is the magic of kung fu, the romance in college, sports, the movement of gangs, some acute melodrama to top it. The production is excellent and the tempo is fast, so it is easy to overcome many of the flaws in this film. <br /> <br /> A child was abandoned next to the basketball court. A homeless man moves him to the Shaolin Monastery in the city center along with a special guide to Kung Fu. The homeless man was somehow unable to read. The old monk teaches the boy but ends up trying to master the special technique in the guide. The school is taken over by a fake kung fu master who is assisted by four foolish monks. A new master gets mad at a 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the weak punches of the master and throwing him out of the night. The boy was found throwing garbage in a basket from an incredible distance by the man who brought him to the gang club to play darts. This leads to a big battle, the expulsion of the boy from the convent and the decision of the man to turn the boy into a sense of college basketball. <br /> <br /> This happens in the first 20 minutes, most of which occurs in the first 10 minutes. Regardless of the extreme storytelling, the first problem is the lack of knowledge of the main character until the film is reached. The man who uses the boy is defined more sharply by the time the first third ends. The plot does not follow any new ground except for the climax of the crazy action of the film. I'm sure that you can easily imagine how foolish monks will appear in the end. Influences, photography, and first-class acts of ploy compensate for the uninspired conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Steven Chow has a much better style of writing conspiracy and comedy and will live in this film but that's not a good reason to ignore him. It is quite entertaining even with its end. Recommended.
