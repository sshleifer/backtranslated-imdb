Contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad on a video. Then my sister discovered that we had a book so I read it. I rented the video the same day that I finished the book. It was very memorable as was the book. The staff was fantastic. Tara Fitzgerald was as excellent as Helen and Robert Graves and they were like Arthur. The costumes, music and settings were amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Warning! Do not read more if you do not talk about this <br /> <br /> On the downside, there are some sexual scenes added and some violence. That's why the video was rated 15. There are some other things that were put up. After the first part, I felt that the accuracy went down. While the book is better than this, I am glad that I have seen it and recommend it to people who have read the book, whether they are Bronte lovers or like the dramas of fashion (I'm all 3!) As long as they progress quickly through sex scenes. The book is somewhat understated. It seems that Ann Bronte's books are not widely read or well-known as Jane Erie or Weathergate Heights which have made television and film several times. another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at the extent of the religion in it, but here they ruled out everything! <br /> <br /> 7/10
