"The Brak Show" is good. Perhaps not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but certainly has many wonderful moments. Mainly follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have a normal life and moved to school, where they live in a neighborhood in the style of the 50th sitcom. The humor and animation of this show is very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode, you can see Meatwad) with strange positions and strange characters. But they are good, and contain funny parts. Some songs are wonderful and others are not much but I love this show. The most personal character is Barak's father. (This is a human being, no one knows why)
