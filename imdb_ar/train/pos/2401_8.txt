Guy Kepe gives the viewer a lot of laughter. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, the very slim actor, is wonderful at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the audience being voted on. The campaign based on not commenting, "I'll take it under advice" and "Maybe yes, but again, maybe not," is the perfect way to win the election. In short, the more stupid the candidate, the greater the chance of winning. After all, the audience can identify with such a person. As for the film, it makes a lot of comedy.
