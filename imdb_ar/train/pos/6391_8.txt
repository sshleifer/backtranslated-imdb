This film was caught at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the festival director told me that it was one of the best films presented). Five minutes in it were sold. Shot in B & W with a limited budget, this movie is hilarious. Strong representation, solid writing and solid film appearance. The representation is probably the biggest revelation, because most films that are filmed on low budgets tend to be representative of amateurs or acting. Not this one. It has one of the most convincing, provocative and funny pictures of a character with Tourette's syndrome that I have ever seen. The plot is spoiled without being unnecessarily confusing and ugly. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers, such as Majkovsky (I hope to be well), deserve the opportunity to switch their purposes to a wider audience.
