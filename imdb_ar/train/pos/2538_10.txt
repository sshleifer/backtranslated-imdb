There are a lot of good things to be said about this movie "B". <br /> <br /> "B" maybe in communications, but not in commission. This is about the best kind of thing I have ever seen. And the voltage of the global effort. The script is good, fantastical, and without error. Written balances: The original Howard Hagen story and the story of Douglas Hodges, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hiller has handled the story and storytelling sites very well. Do not skimp on a lot of extensions and sites. I liked Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewart's mother in the movie "It's a wonderful life"), the female leader, Francis Drake, is a beauty and her role in the grace and compassion of her husband Karloff, and Lugosi was properly underestimated. Many good things: the African discovery of radium X and the melting of stone statues (reminiscent to some extent of the Indian Indians in "Then There Was Nothing") (Agatha Christie) (Bari Fitzgerald)), Karlov glowed in the dark. Which Violet Campbell Campbell played elegantly, and because of all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science that I pictured. This may be the mark of a good piece of art.
