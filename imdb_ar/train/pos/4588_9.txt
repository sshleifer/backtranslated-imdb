PG-13 was classified for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen the story of Polis a couple of times now. In my opinion, the story of Polis is the best film of Chan since the eighties. He originally made it because he did not like the film of the other policeman he had to write in which The Protector was. I have not seen the protector so I can not compare. The representation is not so bad and the plot is very good. Remember this plot well because I've seen this movie for some time, but what I remember is that this movie contains a lot of stunts, stories and comedy that Chan's good film needs. If you can find Police Story and you are a fan of Chan buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtime: 106 minutes <br /> <br /> 9/10
