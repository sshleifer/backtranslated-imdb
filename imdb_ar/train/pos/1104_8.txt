The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvin Douglas) telling a story about his best friend - that client - Jim Blandings (Carey Grant) and his family are tightly packed in a small apartment in New York, with not enough room for the closet and very few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, the announcement of Jim falls in love with (or drops!) A house ad. Once you buy it for home, bills and frustration accumulate constantly as everything can go wrong with Jim's "Dream House" building to make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the three forms of cooperation between Grant and Loy, this charming little comedy - does not charge big taxes, with no real fantastic message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Laughter exists from the beginning, when the alarm clock starts and Jim tries to stop it, just to be thwarted by Moriel. The timing and delivery of lines and comedies can be given only by two experienced professionals, and this is exactly what Grant and Lowy offer us: polished presentations, simple chemistry, and lots of fun. Mirna Loy plays a disrespectful role (Grant Grant's character is apparently getting the lion's share of the lines and acting, as Grant does, as always, with a remarkable blaze), but gives Muriel Luna a life and a bite that Merena Lowe can only give a personality . Milvin Douglas plays a great role in perfect entertainment, never hitting one wrong note. <br /> <br /> Surely one of my favorite viewers should be when Bill closes in the "store room" and Jim goes to "save" him ... just to get everyone trapped inside! Every minor problem arising from the Blandings renewal project - including the small jealousy and advertising campaign for "Wham" - seems to bring together everything that could make a mistake in building a new home but making it a favorite and fun to watch. 10/08
