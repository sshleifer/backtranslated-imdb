A very good wartime film shows the effects of the war on a boy in his hometown losing sight of Guadalcanal and must return home and reset himself with the help of family and friends. Excellent actors help make this movie very entertaining. The role of Eleanor Parker as a friend was worthy of Oscar nomination. She has such a patent for her in this film. Anne's role was equally satisfactory, as were all her small supporting roles. I especially like the aura of the birthplace of Feldflein before the war. The fishing scene is very good. Of course the war scene in Guadalcanal showed the horror our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A film is worth it and should not be forgotten
