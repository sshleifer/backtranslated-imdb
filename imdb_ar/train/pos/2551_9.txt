These almost unknown gems were based on a French farce - this shows, I mean as a scholar. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is dealt with by a wealthy Argentine (Roland), asking her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Coleman), who just arrived in the plane and immediately began to remember the last time Caroline decided she liked someone else: a sculptor of the type of Detantante. The film shows the story of Anthony's strategy in Caroline's chapter about her sculptor, and how this experience helped her with her Argentine. <br /> <br /> Perfectly portrayed: Ronald Coleman In his most sophisticated and enchanting work, Reginald Gardiner, Gilbert Roland is very odd, and I am just an eccentric. The film was beautifully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production feels like a work of love. There are fantastic touches, such as the broken frame of Colman and camera processing, and the exceptional use of the sliding bar closet door. It is a sin not released on a DVD - this is the kind of film that can awaken attention individually in a classic film.
