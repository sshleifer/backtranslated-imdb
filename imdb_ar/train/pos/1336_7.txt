It's a beautiful film with a good story, great actors and great songs. Filming was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest movie points is the disturbing serial series that was copied from Pretty Woman. why? Does it hurt to try some originality, Abbas? Mstan? Is there anyone? <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman-Rani). Priya can not imagine after an accident during her previous pregnancy and finally decided to use an alternative mother to carry her child. They chose Madhopala, a vulgar prostitute played by Pretti Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt it? Even if they choose a girl, does this mean that the man should sleep with her? Have you heard about vaccination? Anyway, I think if the book has heard all this, it will not make the film, so it seems the concept is intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman is acting very well. It's nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his love for his wife and the difficulty of sleeping with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unreal. Rani is just OK. She is generally effective and tries to do something with this role, but Preity Zinta has overshadowed him. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Britti, who largely steals the show with its flawless performance. It makes the transformation of a high whore to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. The film lives, loves and makes you love and enjoy it at the same time, in part because of its role, partly because of its magnetic and positive personality. This is one of their best professional offerings. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her contemporaries in the industry. They should only do such roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie ends by highlighting what I said above. It is a tearful, exciting and well-behaved toy. Watch it for Britti. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - Order Britti!
