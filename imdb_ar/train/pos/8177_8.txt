I'm surprised that no one has ever thought of making a movie like this before. Horror is often more effective when it is used to hate real life. No one (except for Steve Martin in the little horror store) loves to go to the dentist. Torture of teeth has been done by (see The Marathan Man for example), but this brings terror to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes mad. Now our dear doctor was not playing with the entire deck to begin with, but motivated by jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder began to spoil the ruin on those around him. The mounting psychological state of doctors is fairly close to what we see in the personality of Michelle Douglas in the fall, but with the edge of terror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by horror attackers Stuart Gordon and Brian Yozna. Large flow. Ken Furre has also been shown and is always welcome as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Now I think this film will not work without the very impressive performance of Corbin Berenson. After seeing him in LA LA just before, I was stunned by acting. <br /> <br /> The Dentist 2 is also worth seeing, but below the level compared to the original. <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you swing (pun intended) through the superb performance of Bernsen
