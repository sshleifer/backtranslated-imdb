Wonderful! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (speaking Russian), I'm giving up now. In her short skirt, her high boots, and the clear line of the statue, she is a true babe, even if her mysterious shadows resemble a coma. These 30 minutes are by far the most attractive of the series. Note the realistic wrestling match with Bronson until it mercilessly beats the chin and destroys all the fun. Well, maybe I should leave my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> This half hour is produced well by the power consumed behind the success of the series, Buck Hutton. Of course, producers want to top the third season by going above average. It is America after the Holocaust (which we know because it is part of the invading force), leaving only Brunson the Americans and the Soviet Montgomery, along with about 20 tons of real debris. They wander through the devastation of the alternating mood, while we wonder how long it will take biology to skip politics, which of course it does (Lucky Bronson). That's about it. No real talk, except what Brunson says is highly exaggerated. However, the entertainment scenario is still amusing and bold on time, and even suggests that Russian women were not like truck drivers (the common stereotype of the Cold War at the time). <br /> <br /> At the moment - it is strange that Bronson with a Slavic appearance (Puchinsky) will be portrayed as American and Montgomery glamorous appearance like Slavs. Wise appearance, should be the opposite. I think producers did not want to choose the role of physically weaker women, regardless of appearances. However, there may be little fear or the usual atmosphere in the TZ, however the loop remains very 30 minutes.
