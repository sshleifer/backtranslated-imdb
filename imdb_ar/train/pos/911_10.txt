VIVAH in my opinion is the best film of 2006, coming from a director who has proven successful throughout his career. I am not very keen on romantic films these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and highly predictable. However, I have watched this movie three times now ... and believe me it is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional path, featuring simple characters in a realistic and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The movie is entertaining in all its forms because it can be reflected on what we do (or do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Suraj R. Pargatia performed his homework well and filmed a very realistic story in a well-designed entertainment film. <br /> <br /> When you come to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at it without making it very clear In front of his family and family. The song "Do Anjaane Ajnabi" goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her - a shy martyr does not know exactly what he is talking about but pulling out a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, limited eye contact, shy characteristics, quietly answer Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> Amrita's emotional collapse and her uncle (Alukknath) feed him at a Shahid party in the form of her husband's wife instead of her beloved cousin. <br /> <br /> Obviously the film belongs to Amrita Rao along the way. The actress envisioned the role of Ponam with a conviction she could not imagine. She looks beautiful throughout the film, imagining a traditional innocent and completely shy girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor also performs well. Offers promising performance and shows that it is at least Salman Khan when it comes to acting in the movie Suraj R. Pargatia. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a nice couple on the screen, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (excellent), Anupam Khair (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (very good). <br /> <br /> In general, VIVAH offers what she promised, a well-made real-life story for two families. The film features first-rate performances, an excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as an output by Siraj R. Wonderful paragatia. Must see!
