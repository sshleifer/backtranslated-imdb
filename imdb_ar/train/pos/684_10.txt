I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight years old when I was in. I still remember the first episode that was called "The New House". I was afraid of me! I can still hear this statue, laughing madly. And the end, my God! The spirit of the mantis comes in the child's room: Yikes! This was a classic TV and had a great sequel. I found a DVD set for sale online: 2 already. My question to any readers: Did anyone buy this group? It's bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a weak and shining DVD from the "The New House" episode, and two other episodes are a little better, but if anyone knows if these things are clearer, it would be useful for me to buy and share with children. A wonderful series, clever, frightening and incredibly daring. Thanks in advance to any of the fans who have the lowest level in any of this - in fact, I would like to discuss it. Chris Walker
