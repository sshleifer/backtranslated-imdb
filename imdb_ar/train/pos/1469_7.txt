I admit to creating high expectations before watching because some friends mentioned them (they are not pervert!) As they should be. Must see! Do not expect to see something fail. <br /> <br /> Freundy's psychological analysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is a lot of deviation and does not stick to the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the goodies are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, and some of Hitchcock's probably more missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), usually do not miss things unless they are too clear or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> Unlike being repetitive, making it very long, the documentary is fun to note some of the distractions that our subconscious feeds, and thus the commercial success of most of the thriller films have been studied and used as the basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic dialect of Mr. Zizk's narrative and effort to revive Freud's theory, which has been narcotic for a very long time, especially in North America. Again, it is a far superior method and I think it is not a waste of time altogether because I think most people have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
