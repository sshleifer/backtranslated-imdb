Although I loved the city better, I really loved it. I'm a newcomer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Jane Kelly. Although I have heard about them, I have not seen anything with them until recently. The first person I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me impressed with Jane. I think this is also better. But I thought this film was good, and like all the movies, there are some parts better than others, but in my book a wonderful film and I love it. Frank and Jane form a good team. I still have not seen them together to take me to the ball game. But I insisted that I was armed to say that I really enjoyed it, and I love it!
