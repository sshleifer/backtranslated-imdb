I have lived through these times and I believe that the program has captured the heart of the times. I think we should have dealt with more Afro-American issues, but I think they cover a lot in the program. It was scary to sit and watch the T-V riots hoping you would not go beyond your family's house and would not burn. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job of photographing a veterinarian returning from the war. I went to school with young people who came back. Some have changed more than others and others have not much. It bothers me when someone comments that the issue is not covered enough or that it was not amusing enough. We live through it and then make comments. I thought the film was wonderful and everyone in it did a great job. Thanks for the trip (sad and good) down the lane of memory.
