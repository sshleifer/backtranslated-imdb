Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boer offer strong performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays the role of a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Fantastic cinematic photography and its wonderful collections, and the impeccable clothes of Dietrich's finery are also wonderful. It looks fantastic. Boyer looks young and looks great. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman looking for meaning and a former priest looking for life seems somewhat old, but it conflicts with such impersonal groups and skies that work in some way, given the two stars, the wonderful result by Max Steiner, good. The film continues for 76 minutes and appears to have been badly edited, along with certain characters appearing or disappearing. <br /> <br /> Joseph Childcrawt is as funny as the Arab guide, CNN. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucille Watson, the Superior Mother, Tele Loach, the dancer, the great John Carradine, and plays Basil Rathbone .... well, I'm not sure. It's just riding in the desert and spoiling it all! As others have noted, John Gilbert was due to play the role of Dietrich. I can not help but think it was fantastic. Boris's weary role for the world suited the great Gilbert well. After the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career may be back on track. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other film by Dietrich in the 1930s. She looks great and wears some great clothes. My favorite is Valentino, which looks like the dress I wear next to the swimming pool. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look at the lush collections and colors and the two great stars.
