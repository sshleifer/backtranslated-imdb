This movie guides you and makes you addicted to keeping your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is wonderful with narrative parts and the use of camera angles and creative and interesting perspectives that add them all to catch her. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other film I've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? Indie will ask you to discuss the twists and turns of conscious and unconscious awareness. He has a strange feeling with dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. It's a wonderful actor that is not hard on the eyes! His entire being has been poured into this role. From story to story to shooting mode, make this game one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing more of this writer / director / cinematographer creative and innovative !!!
