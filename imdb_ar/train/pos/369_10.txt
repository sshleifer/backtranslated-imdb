Certainly one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen him at least a hundred times and can not pass without crying. I challenge anyone to watch the reunion of Sealy and Nettie, or Shug and Daddy and do not feel your eyes get misty. Whoopie Goldberg must have one prize for her stunning photography. For someone who said you can not love the movie if you love the book, that's a mistake! I certify that.
