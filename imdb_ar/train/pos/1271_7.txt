We never saw this film, based on Nicholas Katzenbach's novel, and taking into account the first class assembled for production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause," though not a terrible film, takes a lot of liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart did not manage. Directed by Arne Gleacher. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a black man is taken to the local area for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tani Brown, and the Wilcox police officer, show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, accused of killing a white girl. We are appalled by what the officers do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, grandmother Bobby Earl is sent north to ask a distinguished professor at Harvard, a retired lawyer, and the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She is an old woman convincing enough to Armstrong to look at the case. He is also convinced of the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair comes to Sullivan, the man who spends time at the same facility as Bobby Earl, tells how to relate to the killing of a young girl, and changes the dynamics of the case. The way the movie is shown in the film is confusing the viewer and distracting Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thrill was made fun by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, the strong actor, gives a good impression like Sherif, who, as far as we can see, is guilty of mistreating his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Cabchu, Robbie De and Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film will not disappoint, even with its mistakes.
