Version: Universal version / version of Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD. Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with "matrix", and perhaps you were among the remaining 15 years who still believed that the "Terminator" was better than the "matrix." I was only a young teenager, looking for a good motion film, then there was a bright light on a television station I had not really seen, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that Jackie Chan's film "A Police Story" will appear later. When I was 15 years old, I saw only "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch it, and continued to "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after the SBS channel showed the "Police Story" trio, I knew I had found my favorite new actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays the role of Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who violates the drug king. Zhou (Yuen Chur). Police Secretary Zhou, Selena Fung (Brigitte Lin), is detained as a witness against Zhou, and Chan has been appointed to protect her. Things go bad - reaaaal bad - when the Chu case is rejected and decides that he wants the death of Fong and Chan. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the greatest action films ever, and certainly one of Jackie's favorite movies is Chan's Movies. Begins strongly, ending with one of the most exciting series of events ever filmed. Everything between them is wonderful. However, some funny parts may seem tasteless more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. For Action, the story is very good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this film than "The New Police Story". These are not "miracles", but this may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> "The Police Story" is one of Jackie's finest works. He has made me hooked on Jackie Chan's films and should provide a good start to any potential Jackie lover. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan's movies do not get much better - 10/10
