Sure, it's a private car in the 1950s, but do not let this fool you. In my little book, there are a number of smart touches with unexpected dolls of humor. Ms. Porter is caught in doubt and is supposed to monitor the place of the document. It not only steals the scene, but also swings around the entire film. Where these independent producers come in dollars for their color photography, a wise decision, because the point will not appear well in the form of b & w. Yes, the result is rough around the edges and shows a number of saliva. But with the exception of many teenagers, the cast of non-Hollywood actors perform well. Then also, the play between the hot cutters and the police is lively and entertaining. Darnness is very good for some managers at home in the pulpit than at the sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of "juvenile delinquents". Then again, the 27-year-old McQueen rarely qualifies for the age division, but runs the fast-paced position anyway. The film was a great success at the time, and it was undoubtedly helped by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio playback. With the exception of the unfortunate final effects, the film is still enjoyable, enjoyable or unavailable. Meanwhile, I wait for the point to come back now that the polar snowflakes have turned into cooling water.
