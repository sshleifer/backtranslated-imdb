It's nice to see Sorag Bargatia back to the best of it. Woven story about marriage. It's good to have a movie where there is not one scene you can avoid watching with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still love the movie, because of the presentation and presentations, and in fact the overall treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. The film revolves around the fact that participation leads to love. Photographic changes in the way you think, behave once you engage is excellent. Certainly the director directed him a lot of thinking and the actors did it to perfection. Although the film is slow, you do not mind it, because you get so involved in the story that you just want to continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple. As typical RajShree material has many emotional scenes that are likely to make the viewer explode in tears (especially the ladies). But when you come out of the movie theater, you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
