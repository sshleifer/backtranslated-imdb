I liked this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is very cool in it. The role of the modern therapist plays to the fullest. (It's very cool.) 2) Help the movie inspire my role-playing game, Mage: The Awakening. She has shown her in many subsequent concerts of LARP, which is always a great success. <br /> <br /> D & D and Jeff-squeezing do not like it, it's a wonderful masterpiece but it's quite fun. The plot moves quickly and is involved in its simplicity, and the special effects are very good for such a low budget, and the script, although there is nothing excellent, has not been performed very badly, and was cheese in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
