This film deserves better. It's very fun, it has some great jokes, blazing eyes, some inner things for "geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are already impressive. Paul Robbins deserves the price of admission alone. I never read the comedy series before I watch the film, but I have since. As good as it is, I still recommend MM film. (Although owning Flaming Carrot as a character was also wonderful), Greg Kinnear is as amazing as Captain Amazing, and can not be one of the Shoveller except for William William Macy's favorite line in the film? "We have a blind date with Destiny. Watch this movie. Buy this movie! It's only $ 5 and some change in local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Really will. Oh, Mrs. Garafolo in it. This alone makes it worth watching
