A famous leader decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes in Dutch with the local church chorus, which will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I first saw this movie yesterday; I like watching foreign films that are not in English. I have already seen a couple of Swedish films in my life, but this film has been the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, one of which is great acting. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a thoughtful, almost shy conductor and devoted to Daniel Darius. Beautiful Freda Halgren charming with her beautiful smile and her hidden behavior. All members of the choir are sophisticated and interesting characters with their own story for each of them. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who dedicated his life to music, and who tries to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born while trying to make peace with The past and the way his life was until then. Kay Pollack shows that the Swedes are prominent filmmakers. Go to see SÃ¥ som i Himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's also comfortable in some way.
