I seem to have dealt with this because ABC has licensed this offer to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. I was surprised, because it was a break from listening to anything Chinese. But I'm beginning to feel chaotic, as the lines of actors and storytelling are nothing but New York City. There is nothing unbelievable, although I think it is very stereotyped that they write Damian as a potential black man with a paper !!!! This was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is wonderful and I feel sad when I learned on IMDb that I do not look forward to watching the second season when I return to the United States. I am quite disappointed like other commentators that this showed a lot of promise, quality and taste. But just as show shows show the affinity of characters, it is likely to be difficult for people to observe whether they are beginning to watch several episodes.
