Michael Keaton is Johnny Dangrios in this documentary about gangster films that was produced in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays the role of his sick mother, Griffin Dan is his brother in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Peter Boyle is his boss, and his friend Marilo Henner. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton, owner of a pet shop in the 1930s, is holding a child stealing and then telling him, in the flashback, how he came to own the pet store. He turned to theft at an early age to get his mother pancreatic operation ($ 49.95, especially this week) and began working with the mob chief (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name "dangerously" in the mob world. <br /> <br /> There are some fun scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot where Johnny's ugly mother was replaced in her body. Peter Boyle as Johnny's head offers a very funny performance, as does Don Griffin, a straight-forward DA who will not "play a ball" with a crooked Pur (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's enemy, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a prominent figure like Moroni, who tortures English - but you have to listen to her doing it instead of reading about her. What makes it funny is that he does everything with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The film gets a bit tired in the end, but it's worth watching, and a great ketone like the good boy / the bad boy Johnny. For some reason, the significance of this movie was minimized when it was released, and like the other Keaton jewel, "Night Shift", you do not hear much about it today. With some real gems and shows, you'll find Johnny Dangrios very enjoyable.
