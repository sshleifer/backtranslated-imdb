This is an excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney. His talents here show that his career is long in front of him. The car and the truck are an exciting chase for the 1937 era. This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Byington Spring Performance is excellent as usual. Please Mr. Ronnie or the film rights holders, take the opportunity and get this product on a DVD I think will be the winner.
