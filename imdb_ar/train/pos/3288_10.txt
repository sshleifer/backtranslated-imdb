This is a great way to make a fantastic movie. One of my favorites, is really very cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who followed the lead by Candeman, and began a brilliant start with this film. <br /> <br /> The film about a girl named Anna gets sick from glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from the exercise book, and falls into a dream where the house is real. Every next dream is changed by having what you add to the picture. In her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called Mark. Friendship with him and their relationship becomes stronger when dreams become darker and more frightening. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke who plays Anna's role is a wonderful actress, and oddly enough that after just one film, it should disappear and never disappear in anything again forever. It really does perform great in this film. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's result is also ace. Like Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. It is a real shame that soundtracks are no longer available on CD. DVD is available in R2 only.
