Diego Armando Maradona, still the best footballer, had presented the game. Not just a gymnast, but an artist. This documentary if the 1986 World Cup will live forever in the memories of all football fans around the world. Because of his incredible goal, which he scored against my country (England). There is no point in minimizing this star. Although I dont lean down, I only appreciate the Argentine narrator. Actually cry of happiness, and can hardly express his feelings ..... everything you wrote can be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ..... you have to see this to know what I mean.
