"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by the Italian composer Luciano Legaboy, who also directs the film and writes the musical score. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of northern Italy, in Emilia-Romagna. Area. We are in 1975, the first time free radios - one of the boys in the film creates "Radioraptus". Among the topics are the desires of young people, friendship, love, sex, individual drama, unemployment, but the film also talks about drugs - Frichia, the main character, a victim of heroin enslavement. <br /> <br /> Without being dull and moral, the story flowed very well. The spontaneous actors are powerful and method oriented as well. Luciano is clearly not "Liga" Ligabue is not Fellini nor a film professional, first of all he is a musician. But he succeeds in making a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat success with his second film, "Da zero a dieci" - not good at all. <br /> <br /> In the actors in "Radiofreccia" are not generally famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. In a small role we see another Italian lyricist - Francesco Guccini, who is a gentle Communist bar man and football coach!
