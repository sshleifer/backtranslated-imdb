How can I miss the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, and so, hired this mess for a movie. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of Ned Kelly and I was surprised at what she discovered about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how this film was reduced. Maybe the truth was too late and at the end of the 4-hour marathon, or maybe because it was a bit slow, I found it hard to follow the story. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting figures with dimensions. <br /> <br /> Although I fail to recommend this as a must, it is a wonderful story of Australian history (given how young the country is, this is very rare and must be appreciated) and the film contains some good sequence of actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 His vision of historical value .... (yes true ... that is the only reason to see him ...)))
