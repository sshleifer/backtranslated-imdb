Probably more than many movies, this one is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing down, meditating and allowing things to happen in their time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, such an approach speaks to a deep part of themselves that they know exist, and the other part they long to call. <br /> <br /> I assume it's a job in terms of my place in my life these days, but I figured myself in the last group camp. I found the contemplative speed of this film almost numb, and gently guided me to a nearly mythical world. It is indeed a story of a journey, a rich depiction of the distance that many of us should travel if we are to reach a full circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> He also wrote about Mr. Farnsworth's presentation to Alvin frankly, although I am not sure there are words to express the wonderful balance of the disillusioned grief and the wise innocence that he has brought to us. Knowing now that he was already about to die with his death sitting on this jars seat makes me wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him before leaving. I hope he has a small glimmer of satisfaction and the truth he has brought to many people, not only for "action" but for sharing his absolute humanity with this brutal truth. <br /> <br /> Given the facts of production, I am not sure that Mr. Lynch was given full credit for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop very slowly. From outside to film production, however I understand that there are few areas of modern life where the expression "time is money" is strictly descriptive. Deepening our hearts is not an adventure that can be accelerated, and Lynch seems to realize that he was not just telling a story - he was inviting his viewers to spend time with their deaths. Not a simple task, that. <br /> <br /> If you want to try the power of the movie you took, give you a valuable part of yourself, you can do worse than spend a few hours with The Straight Story. Then give yourself some time for the next few while simply listening to his ears in the small hours of the night.
