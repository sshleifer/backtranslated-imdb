I must admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the festival's artistic director specifically recommended this film to an audience of more than 200 people before presenting another film, I decided to go see it. Wonderful! <br /> <br /> This film addresses the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any compromise. I found myself crying several times during the film and laughing at others. Talk about emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is the Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 years old at the time of filming) and had to deal with this very complicated and difficult role. Becca Casselle Hughes reminded me of Will Ryder, but the role here is more urgent as she has to play the role of a prostitute. She is likely to win many awards. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a girl who was sold for prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She met with America (Ron Livingston played in a dramatic role we were not used to seeing him), after spending some time with her and decided to help her. However, it is sold again and is being sought throughout Cambodia. The story unfolds, and the public can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Representation was strong all over the world with very enthusiastic international representatives. Udo Kerr (very convincing as a sex tourist), and Virgin Ledwin (touching as a social worker) and Chris Ben (one of his last films). The Asian acting team was also great. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult subject, it successfully focuses on telling a strong and compelling story. He was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real working brothels), which makes you feel more or less watching a documentary. DP seems to have used a lot of hand-held camera and close-up images in general and made you feel quite there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the show, I listened to other members of the audience when they left and they seemed to be stunned. This is not an easy-to-see movie, and filmmakers are happy not to make Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's the best film I've ever seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The view is shared by my husband and two other friends.
