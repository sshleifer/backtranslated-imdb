Gundam Wing is a delightful show. I appreciate it for getting Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching their predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: One aspect that has long been retained by Gundam is having their characters go to difficulties and grow into maturity. This does not happen in the wing. Heero is the best dog in the beginning and was the best dog in the end. Characters do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is considered a hero for all purposes and purposes in most serials. But suddenly the chain betrayes him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has great designs for the suit. Gundams is very wonderful, as Abion is my favorite. I'm even thinking of a few OZ suit designs to be on par with some classic Xeon suits. But sweet suits do not save the string of boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing enjoys cool fighting scenes, although they are full of recycled animation, but a shallow plot and personal development. Fun, but not moving like the previous Gundam outings.
