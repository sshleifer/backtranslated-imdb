I missed the entire show season and started watching it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I'm totally crazy about the show. I think the entire staff is excellent. It's one of my favorite programs at all. I only checked the ABC program for this fall and did not see it in the table. This is really sad. I hope they will return it ... maybe they wait until Bridget Moynahan gives birth to her child? Or is it just my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I have read some of the published reviews about the show and see a lot of glowing notes, like comments. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hope that it will receive another station.
