The film took a new angle in Gandhi's life, which is wonderful to see and show how human. His relationship with Harillal is something that Gandhi is troubled by and has repeatedly mentioned as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was amazing in the film. It could have been better than the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's words seemed so large and it seemed as though he had been deliberately portrayed in a negative form in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really comprehensive, but it focuses only on the father-son relationship. The rest is unclear and used only to show the time frame and the overall setting of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautiful in general if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
