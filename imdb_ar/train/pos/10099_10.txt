Anime that made me hooked on the anime ... <br /> <br /> He was appointed in 2010 (hey, this is not too far now!) Earth is now contaminated land for toxic gases of pollution and violence. Because of the 30-second crimes being committed by thieves who possess the firepower of Third World terrorists, the fictional Newport City Government is the tank police to deal with the problem - the police with tanks! O madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a Japanese woman with red hair (yes I know, their Japanese names are not clearly matched with a Japanese look) who have only been recruited into the tank police and his partner quickly with Cute blond man blue eyes al. Leona is new in the use of tanks, and unfortunately, it destroys the favorite Tank Tank Captain Charles Charles (also known as "Brenten"), a big man like Tom Selleck on steroids and plays a pair of stylish sunglasses, a big gun and a bad mood. Britain did not like Luna to join the tank police in the first place, and her destruction of the Tiger Green Tiger does not exactly love her, nor does he like to take the remains of his giant tank. And used it to build a small tank called Bonaparte and quickly moved to take care of children, "where the size of boys is larger," as he put it. There are also specs, biochemistry genius, quoting the Bible / God for fear of the priest, Mohan Muhan purple, and the head of Botil Bot, who is located on the edge thanks to the mayor shouting at him always about the alien in the police tank. Seeing how the police tanks often destroy half of the city while chasing the bad guys and using extreme violence to arrest them, they do not like them well. <br /> <br /> The "bad guys" are Cyborg named Boaco, who has a mysterious past associated with a project known as "Green Peace" and his gang and two of his exciting works Cyborg Saye Anna & Yoni Puma. In the first installment, these men are paid to steal urine samples from a hospital that treats people who have not had toxic gas clouds, and in the second part they are hired to steal a painting from bare boo. However, the story is not completed in the anime and ended in a comic book ("manga") hard to find. <br /> <br /> All sorts of chaos and chaos are brewing in this black comedy project to see how much people want to go to the police to catch the criminals and what happens when the fine lines begin between the bad guys and the bad guys. This is the thing that if you are going to shoot a movie of it, it is better to get Quentin Tarantino. Not flat in places but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
