Inspired at least by Effie Benson and the Orchestra Orchestra, which was presented throughout the war at the Covent Garden Opera House, this film tells the attempts of an older saxophone player to repair the girls' group (almost) with which she played as a girl at the end of World War II. All the very fast past shots bring us to the original band on stage some wonderful music, and help us fill the background for the band members, especially the girls' relationships with the only male member - the transsexual drummer (who tries to dodge the call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judy Dench are playing a great role in leading performances such as Elizabeth Widows recently Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is ideally suited as the band's leader, now playing the piano on the sea side, and June Whitfield as the Salvation Army's Trombone. The appearance of Cameo by other greats such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw makes this experience an unforgettable experience. The movie is a passage filled with memory, with all the stars that must be, with all rights, to be a group of actresses above the hill. All I can say is, I hope to look good in their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. It definitely still gets my pulse going! While I saw that, I was mentally imagining the output manager for not using women of the right age. Afterward, I looked at these girls and discovered that each of them was old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although this might be a bit for Judy Dench). <br /> <br /> If you love swing teams, or thrive on nostalgia, or just want to know how well a woman manages appearance with nearly three quarters of a century behind, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
