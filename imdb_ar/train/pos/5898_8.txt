Penny Princess finds working American girl Yolandi Dunlone inheritor of a small kingdom located in this triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet on behalf of Lampedora. It seems as though Lampedorans owe bills throughout Europe and the country's main occupation is smuggling because of geography. An American millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can win the title. His closest heir is Donnelan. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the estate must go through American jurisdiction and what does Lampedorans do? Especially since Dunant, who now became a princess, forbade smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems as if Lampedorans have a kind of cheese they call a hyssop named Shmeiz. With a few bumps on the way, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How Schmeeze works, this will be a gimmick for the whole movie. But here's a hint. In Lover Come Back, Jack Crouchin may have obtained a shamanic secret when he was busy inventing Rock Hudson's VIP and advertising agencies. <br /> <br /> In any event, Penny Princess is a wonderful combination of British masquerade and romantic comedy. Yolandi Dunlone again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe could have played if the film had made that aspect of the pool. Dirk Bogard was well shot in the part that was in the beginning of his career as a romantic heartbeat, before anyone suspected he had his acting casts. <br /> <br /> This movie was unfortunately shown at 3:00 in the morning on Traditional Chinese Medicine. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
