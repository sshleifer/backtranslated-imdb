This movie gets it right. As a former Cadet in the US Air Force, I can tell you that this movie contains everything. Boredom of the application process. Waiting for the floor. The joy of acceptance. Concern about making it through the session. The sadness of watching friends (probably the best of them) is washing. Pains pay for the final - the death of student pilots fllow. Glory of graduation. Always fly, fly, fly. He called many, but few selected. We did what we were eager to do.
