Since it was only a small child when this show was originally broadcast, I recently picked up the DVD set and I hope that more episodes are filmed. The show was a 1970s version of the popular TV series "Files X" in the 1990s - but with a light comedy approach. But do not get me. Some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which contain some terrible plots (which, of course, were left to the imagination - it was in the early 1970s). <br /> <br /> Some plots where a bit ridiculous as well as acting, but this is the charm and attraction of the series. Whether you like criminal drama of crime, comedy or science fiction / horror themes, this series brought together all of this. Each episode was recorded in about 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and 50 minutes pass quickly leaving me wanting more. A cool classic show that is taken lightly in my book!
