INVADERS is a fast motion film driven by science fiction Ben Cross and Sian Young. Ben Ren, a traveler from another galaxy journey to find a verse (played by the SEAN), plays physically ideal to have a child. This child, if allowed to give birth and return to his planet, may be the only chance to survive. The enemy, an alien who destroyed the Rennes people, was also followed by Rangers across the stars to stop the birth. He reappears across a large group of comedians where the comedian enters the local bar and orders his first cocktails, to get to the race with the enemy and drama what ANIE can keep and the baby's head.
