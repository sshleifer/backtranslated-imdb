After watching the film last night, I felt a sense of hopelessness faced by organizations trying to address the problem posed by the film. The scale of prostitution seems so great that it is hard to see how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Although it is a melancholy movie with an uncomfortable central relationship, it is a very attractive film, and I went further to say it was fun. The film was well edited for playback time and Thuy Nguyen's performance was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston had played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It was good to have more insight into why Patrick felt that he was helping Holly, but perhaps the reason is simple because he explains to Chris Ben. I will not explain it here - go to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good, thought-provoking film with clearly good intentions. I hope to get a version wide enough to reach an appropriate audience and gain more support for the K-11 project.
