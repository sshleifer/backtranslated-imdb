"Moonstruck" is a film I liked for the first time I saw it. I really liked it for the second time. I loved him for the third time. Now is one of my favorite all the time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The film offers a lot of humor. The story unfolds in an Italian neighborhood of an old school in New York City. Share Search for love is fun to watch. This film is, by far, the best work done by Nicolas Cage in the film. The personality of the wonderful old man. The screen shines without saying a word. The scene with Kluah was a beautiful moon. But perhaps the best personality is the character played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is a scene where the main characters speak of an oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. The trend is extraordinary and concludes.
