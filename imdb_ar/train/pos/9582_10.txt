After I grew up in the streets of Detroit, Michigan, I have friends who traveled to NYC balls, fell into lifestyle as a member of the House. I joined the House of the Houthis. We adapted the same rules as most homes, but we were scammers who would promote and fraud on credit cards to get the wonderful jewelry and clothing that we wanted. I even learned how to make checks and driving licenses and criticize them in more than seventeen states, so I was contacted by a jealous queen of the Secret Service and went to the federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this film and strongly recommend watching it yourself. You can even read how you grew up in homes here in Detroit and the criminal activity that we indulged in. My book, ID Schemes is available for sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it's much better than the burning Paris, because it was made in 2005.
