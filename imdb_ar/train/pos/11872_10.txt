Many people like this movie and many others like it, but it seems all for the wrong reasons. Scarface must be loved and loved but not the way it was or not. <br /> <br /> Many people say that acting was more than others, but it is better to do more personal than the Pacino. To say that Pacheco went to the top would be less than reality. Yet he does so well, he brings out the inner devil from you well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great man at first, but his thirst for power lifted from the disease of greed to another level; an inhuman level. At times, Patino seems to be a little caricature and a bit surreal, but that does not seem to me at all a responsibility. The cast served its job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not at her best, but she certainly suited the role she played. On the other hand, Stephen Bauer was at his best, and still Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was as good and Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role well. Robert Loggia I've always enjoyed watching the scream. Unlike Pacino they were not really any outstanding performance or memorable performances. Everyone seemed to fit their roles by being there. They did not fit perfectly, but they were sufficiently hooded. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this film. The more the actor gets to live with his performance, the more credit should be given to the director, and certainly I will give this to Palma. Brian de Palma, though disrespectful, is a versatile manager from my point of view. He knows how to make films according to their types, but this sometimes did not turn out well. In this film, this is a film for gangs, but few are much better than this film because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> The writing was great as it was just Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and I saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was no less surprised. This is his testimony though. I always have from him as a great writer and prove this to me again with Scarface. No one knows how to write a surreal truth for a film by Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good but not fantastic. It's definitely not my favorite Giorgio Moderer. The music was very small for me in the eighties but it did not bother me. The cinematography was good, and it was not amazing, but who really cares about such a film. <br /> <br /> This may have been one of the most influential films in the last 25 years, but as we have already mentioned for the wrong reasons. People must realize that the character of Tony Montana is not a hero, he is a monster. It's not inspiring anyway. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and consumes himself. However, he is an example for many people because he is somehow rebellious, but perhaps most of all, he is a gangster. The guard will be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface. <br /> <br /> Although the good thing about this film is that it shows that Tony Montana is not the real problem. If we or the people of power want to close people like him, we can do it, but we do not. In a terrible twisted way is a necessity for our society. He's a person you can blame for everything, and you've done better. Tony Montanas in this world are scapegoats for our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Rather, it is a reminder that we must not apologize or allow ourselves to do bad things simply because we measure or believe that we compare better with gangs or drug dealers. I love this movie because it is more than just a corruption film, it is a film that makes you reflect yourself in a strange way.
