I just finished watching this film and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Jay combine the actors of an existing movie (ish) and make them into such glorious characters, he has given us a fictional film line of varied storyline with plenty of imagination left. <br /> <br /> Many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and delivered to them on the board ... However, these are the films that become poor comments because they are highly predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is distinctive. Get it now!
