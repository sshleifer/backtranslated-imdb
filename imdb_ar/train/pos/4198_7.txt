From the opening scene on a busy train where RICHARD WIDMARK steals from the JEAN PETERS, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is relentlessly watching. This is partly due to the fact that representation is uniformly stronger than the entire cast. The B & W is clear and adds to the strength of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's trend puts him in the same league with VIPs such as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, there is the same urgency as Huston's about stealing, but the reward is not quite strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS are as good as the strong-edged girl described by Widmark as "knocked around a lot". It gives a lot of attractive and attractive energy to the role played by the uneducated woman who carries a miniature film in her purse for her boyfriend (Richard Kelly), something that the FBI already knows. They are on their way when the theft occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to her image of a woman called Moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. She particularly touches her last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This scene is guaranteed to attract your attention within one hour and twenty minutes of time. Hassan Nawar of Fox and distinguished performance of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
