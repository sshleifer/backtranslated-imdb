Finally, watch this classic TV movie on an unregistered old VHS CD, a classic horror film. It is more unfortunate than this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... TV horror film. Recommended for all lovers of the 70th TV movie is very similar to the trilogy of terrorism. Interested people should get a book on this subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70. Send me an email to get a chance to see it ..... It's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> She's having problems like many TV movies that have to be creative in effect effects and even in 70 minutes it can seem that it will take maybe we all got used to more modern editing but things are still wonderful and much better From many of the theatrical films released today.
