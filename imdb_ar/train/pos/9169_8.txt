I loved Timothy Dalton a lot although he was a bit young and very handsome to Mr. R. But I thought Zilla Clark was stocky and short. But this version was very true to the novel and filmed very well. I've seen 4 versions, but Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R, although George C Scott performed very well, and that was important between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although both were very old on this role. I recently watched a great television version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I like to see these two doing Jane Eyre. While I was watching the Ciaran Hinds version, I think I was Jean Eyed, but I will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing Joan Fontaine's voice telling the opening of the first edition I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
