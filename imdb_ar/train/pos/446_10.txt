One of my favorite movies all the time. Only beautiful, full of human passion, wit, humor, intelligence. The story grows, as well as the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic ... a wonderful collection of the best British talent around. I loved them all for every variety that was brought in the film. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to form a story like this, - everything about this film works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
