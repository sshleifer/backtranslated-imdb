90 typical comedy, situational comedy similar to our modern "My Family". Because Thatcher is the climax of most political jokes, Bill (Blinda Lang) blames Thatcher for anything she can. "Bloody killer" may be shared with most of us. David the typical teenager, slicing the brains of bread knives, Jenny, the older temperamental girl, is only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as far as possible to keep their families on their feet in the economic climate of the early 1990s. Granted the first and second series were not as successful as the latter, however, Series 3 onwards is where everything starts with more laughs that I care about counting. In general, this offer did not get the best viewing times and should last a little longer. Obviously they could not continue after the death of Gary Olsen, but I think they should get rid of "Catherine Tate" "Office" and "Little Britain" and re-classic!
