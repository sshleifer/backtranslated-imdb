For such films as "Anchors Aweigh", a few were awarded as many Oscars at a happy hour break. Either 1945 was a good year besieged by a good film, or they still suffer from the shock of Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that they wrote anything from A on the ballot to get the best picture to satisfy the believer. Since Jeanne Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in "Singin 'In the Rain," there was a mistake in MGM's backgammon systems. Of course, the studio is in his best behavior during this famous tour of the great studios and Hollywood itself, which is easy for those who hold them on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> The wonderful talents of Jane and Frank Sinatra are certainly an enjoyable farce, although more people need to be bemused in music reviews, so today's audience will not slap an unnecessary runtime. There were many long pieces before that, but in this case, it was possible to eliminate all the fascinating Kathryn Grayson scenes. Until the movie "Kiss Me Kate" appeared, it was probably a non-opera enthusiast watching any of her films with remote control at hand. <br /> <br /> If there is a need to practice the 1949 women's capture of the city, the lucky sailors who left the sailors may not have prepared a test with Jose Iturpe and beat the piano to get the full delivery of the "Suzy" heart. Few are lucky to get a screen test at the MGM Golden Studios. Then few are the most fortunate to attend. There is no remorse for the successful screen tests of Susan Abbott or Kathryn Grayson, but it makes a permanent hope for the opera to deliver the final pink slip to both. <br /> <br /> But for everyone, star talent is good, and above average it is thrown with a wonderful, light but fun story that is intertwined with young aspiring aquatic children who benefit from emotional bursts of wartime. 'At least do not doubt choosing the wrong MGM movie. The trend is steadfast because the cast carries the story in a beautifully colored cinematic. When someone bumps into music or song, the film makes a happy occasion. <br /> <br /> The most important feature of the film is Gene Kelly's adventures in Fantasia, and she climbs a great dance with Jerry The Mouse. This is a worthy masterpiece in Kelly's career, and it's good to know that he thought about it before Fred Astaire started dancing on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly a place for a triple flavor, rainbow sprinkle, chocolate wafer biscuits, cream, cherries and banana ice cream, but a square lump of sugar melts in your mouth one way or the other and despite the guilt, Cheerfully. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
