"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best 80s of the movie directed by John Hughes. Everything happens in a bubble-colored world where everyone is attractive, and there are some conflicts that are easily resolved and sometimes far from happy actions, and huge amounts of plots are summed up by composite images that have been tuned to pop music. There is nothing wrong with this, however. Bending like Beckham is an absolute treat from start to finish. My wife and I found ourselves absolutely victorious of the cabbage cheese even when we scoffed at it, and in the end, just as it was embarrassing because this is recognition, we applauded (and we saw this, incidentally, in our lives) room, not in the theater). Watch this movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
