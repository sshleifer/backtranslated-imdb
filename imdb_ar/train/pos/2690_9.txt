La Teta i la Luna (The Breast and the Moon) describes the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, a maniacal man who grows up in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna movies (also director Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me how exciting life can be in this age. It is also from Catalonia (north-eastern Spain) brought a lot of memories to my mind. This film illustrates how beautiful Catalonia is, nice people, beautiful lives, especially a lot of people who are not nervous.
