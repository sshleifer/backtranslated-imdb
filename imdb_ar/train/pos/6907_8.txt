This movie is fun to watch. If you love "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll get a kick from this. Dave thought in South America, while Dreyfus plays the role of Jack Noa, the actor who was chosen by the head of the island state of the secret police of Barador to replace the drunken dictator of a dictator, Alphonse Simms, after a heart attack and died. Noah is sympathetic, assisted by the former dictator's mistress, in an attempt to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as a famous American immigrant who turns to the CIA. Also starring Polly Holliday and Fernando Ray. <br /> <br /> A few silly moments like the body of the old dictator remain frozen for a year, and the final scene, where Sonia Braga, a bee embracing the bloodied body of Driffs, later glimpses it all in white, . But all in all is wonderful.
