I do not understand. I am not a critic, I do not appreciate the quality of acting, which I find very well. My confusion lies in the content. No one else is sensitive to the fact that these two dishonest women justified the betrayal of men who were fighting and bleeding to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their country. There should not be an introduction to let us know if the men have returned home and if so, what is the effect of their suffocating "wives"? While these women were reeling from loneliness because of loneliness, did they think their husbands would enjoy shooting at them as they face death or autopsy every day? They did not think of their husbands at all! Only from themselves. Pardon me, only when they wish the death of their husbands.
