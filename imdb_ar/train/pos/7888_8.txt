Freddy Krueger, Dream Chaser of Elm Street Returns, the famous actor Robert Englund returned in a series of Nightmare 5, The Child's Dream. I hope I get the number correctly. It's been a lot, and this is one of the best, especially for young people, Rosanne Bar (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp, (who did the first nightmare at 84) Alice Cooper (singer) You'll see Freddy as a tortured child, (Creepy) The effects are very funny and creative, and the crew also includes Lisa Zin (sister Billy) Birekin Mair (Journey on the Road) Yaphet Kotto (Alien, Live and Let Die Die) and Amanda Donahue (Father Knows Better) You're one of the people who saw this in trilogy Dimensions, as well as the finish. I love 3D movies. I missed the first three-dimensional wave in 1953 (I had not yet been born) and was the second wave in 1983. I love all of Freddy's films. Freddie became one of the best people who did not make the first one that was absolutely wonderful. Freddy became the new monster in the 1980s and 1990s, along with Jason Furheys, Chuckie, Michelle Myers, Can you imagine a movie with them all? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror lovers alike.
