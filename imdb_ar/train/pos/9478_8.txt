It's a nice little movie with a nice story, and it plays the most important role in the entire film. <br /> <br /> It's a very dramatic story, with a romantic story as well. The story is listed slowly but this works very well to accumulate. The characters are nice and well photographed by their representatives. Usually, I'm not a fan of Asian acting, but acting in this film was simply good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is quite different in style and style from other genre films produced in the West. In a way, this film is actually much more advanced by comparing it to Western films produced during the same period. <br /> <br /> I just wish his visual style was a little better. For the film, which is a kind of art film, this film certainly lacks some good-looking sequences. It is clear that this film was very cheap and made in general. This is not a bad thing; it prevents the film from really distinguishing itself and raising itself above genre. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is about his well-designed story and the characters that exist. In this regard, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
