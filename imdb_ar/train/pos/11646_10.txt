This film, although it revolves around one of the most popular subjects of Mexican producers: the harsh life of our cities, has a funny way of putting it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of Mexico's most important directors have recently come close to the history of our city in a variety of literary genres because it can be a farce or satire, which gives us a film with more than one subject exposed in our country, Very different and that give tone to his freshness. <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of knowledge of the actors, but this is explained in an excellent way and their paper, each of the directors in the stories reflects the ability that has been determined by us anywhere in the world, and the ability of laughter and pain to make the celebration sad. Perhaps for many people in our country, the film was not happy, but I think people in other countries may find it attractive and share the surrealism of Mexicans.
