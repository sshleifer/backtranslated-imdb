Spacecam is one of the favorite movies for children, and my mom and dad can enjoy watching it too. I grew up in the eighties of the last century, I enjoyed this movie, it's a plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on a DVD, and when I have my own children, they can enjoy watching this movie as much as I enjoyed it. The plot is fun, a group of children, embarking on a journey they never expected, when a rocket was launched into space by a highly collectible robot. They were in Osh at first, but when they realized that they did not have enough oxygen to go back to panic they drowned. Once they regained enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as better friends and new respect found for life.
