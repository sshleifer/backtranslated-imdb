I saw him in a movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The show I attended was a salary for African Americans, making the difference between the public reaction between the two groups a wonderful social comment on the state of race relations in the country. Basically, white people were afraid to laugh or laugh nervously at the funny pieces - and there are so many! - because they "laugh at the blacks", while the blacks also remained silent because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being an Asian (and therefore not part of either group), spent a wonderful time watching the satire of rap culture and its / its temptations / values ​​/ false philosophies. The cast is talented and does a wonderful job in becoming the characters that were filmed. The songs are too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best counterfeit documentaries, including "A Mighty Wind"
