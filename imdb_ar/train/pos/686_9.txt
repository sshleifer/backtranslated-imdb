Ghost Story (1972) was the lead of the NBC series. The film was well written and well represented, and I thought that when the TV season began from 1972 to 1973, if the television series was half the level of the film, NBC has a winner. (I hope this movie is available with video !!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as executive director. Producer. However, if you have a chance to watch the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
