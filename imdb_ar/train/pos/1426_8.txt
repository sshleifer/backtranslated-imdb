I have to say that "looks" are sometimes all that matters, just as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC (not about our land, but right anyway) has pointed out. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this movie looks amazingly stunning beauty, you will absolutely love what you see your eyes. <br /> <br /> Hence, there is a movie personality too, and interesting, with the voice of the magician narrator and storyteller stories that will touch your soul as you watch those beautifully photographed images. <br /> <br /> The movie may not affect your lifestyle, destroying this beauty, but it will certainly remind you how valuable our land is. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves 10 stars because it is one of the few documentaries that I really enjoyed.
