It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen - it contains everything - a truly impressive script, and the fine actors make it a beautiful art to watch, and a truly elegant romance (shame that this kind of romance just does not seem to exist anymore) And beautiful songs (especially the final song), a result of artistic, fashion and collections that make you want to live in. The end was just a disappointment because I was expecting the amazing film to have a wonderful end - but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies there. Definitely check out this movie - again and again. There are many details that you miss the first time that are worth a second look.
