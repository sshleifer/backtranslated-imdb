Shirley McLean in another role dedicated. As the mother of a single mother in a Chicago neighborhood of the working class in 1962, the veteran actress gets another exercise as a brave woman who will not let any setbacks defeat her spirit of success. Children, a boy and a teenage girl, are attracted to a lively Zoe aunt, although many of the magical tricks and practical jokes learned from them, applied to all the wrong opportunities, eventually expel them from school. The plot is cleverly surrounded by the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social implications. Men who build shelters, people who watch news programs seem to be the only television set, at dinner, a general fog of anxiety and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is blown away with dimensions, the climatic result makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! It is clearly a small-budget production, still a sweet little film, full of the magic of Sunday Matini. With a few options put into "old songs" on an audio track, the whole family will certainly enjoy it. ****
