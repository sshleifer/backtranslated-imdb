It's only two episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can say that this is one of the best things I have ever seen. This is on TV or silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's very good, it's very frustrating! As a viewer, it's so fun that I'm upset because the episodes are over two weeks instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are in fact positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern young man who has already been transformed from television dramas. Compared to films, television dramas seem dated, very misleading, and generally boring! "Five Days" has already brought television drama into the twenty-first century, so for me at least, it is changing. Go watch it.
