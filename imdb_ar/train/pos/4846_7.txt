It's a classic British comedy I've always wanted to check, but no chance has been created yet. (Most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version did not seem to have survived in its entirety!); For the new version under review, the plot was updated according to the time situation The current war. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was primarily familiar with the early British comedians through Will Hay's films: Since this film presents a similar plot of legendary stalking, smuggling agents and enemies, it is in this context largely ( Was actually written by the regular writing team at Marriott Edgar, Val Geist and Jock Orton); the stranded travelers element, then, was a tried and true formula equally. The star this time is Arthur Asky (who was instigated by Richard Murdoch) - none of his films I have seen before - is unlikely to be a hero like Hay himself and who proves his character is likely to be annoying ... but soon he is warming up For him, Askey certainly comes with a number of ingenious and entertaining lines of works around to justify the fact that the leading character in the play (and 1931 film version) has been divided into two parts here, with Murdoch acting as a straight star partner. <br /> <br /> Individual remote setup (film events largely during one stormy night) provides some wonderful atmosphere; another half hour - with the sudden appearance of the mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and ultimately the arrival of the same pottery car - It is well swept and handled well. Kathleen Harrison is one of the remaining actors who is the most dreaded stereotype, with her buddy parrot, who pays him all the excitement for her first drink.
