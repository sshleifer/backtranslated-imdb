Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary film about firefighters in New York City. What they got was the only film inside the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's ladder company, Gul went with the captain to check and repair the gas leak, while Gideon remained in the fire room in case anything interesting happened. A plane flying low above the city had distracted Gul's attention, and the camera was up seconds before the plane crashed into the first tower. <br /> <br /> Gul asked the captain to follow him in the towers. The first thing he saw was the shooting of two people, something he refused to photograph. He remained on site for several hours to come, filming the reactions of firefighters and others who were there. <br /> <br /> The Nudit brothers have been keen not to make the film too violent, bloody, and juri. But the language of the firefighters is a little rough, CBS showed a lot of balls that broadcast without censorship. The Nudit brothers mixed footage with individual interviews so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during certain moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film with a similar title, most of the money goes from DVD sales to charity related to the events of September 11. The best documentary of its kind so far has been well prepared, emotional and influential and completely devoid of political propaganda.
