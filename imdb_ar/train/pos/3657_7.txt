This film is similar to the 1950 version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less sex and less realistic, but a great humanitarian story and warmth. I will not call this a new realistic picture. It is very emotional and resembles a fairy tale, and perhaps it should be categorized as a comedy, although it deals with serious issues (such as Chaplin or 1930's) typical Italian nevertheless, very passionate and hard to resist except for a cool stone person. Emotional is a disappointment, although this picture was not intended to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a fun and fun comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
