Why can not more directors today create horror films like "The Shining"? There is an easy answer to this: Modern-day managers are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once with this film that he was one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson brilliantly) and his family move to a secluded large hotel to observe it off-season. Kicker is that the former Charg√© d'affaires of the hotel brutally murdered his wife and two daughters. The following can easily be summarized in the title of the film, but you should see it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in a very long time to make me "scary." It's some things seriously messed up, but in a good way.One of the things that add to the fear factor is the amazing music. Of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, to name a few) and he certainly does not disappoint in this film.The result sets out exactly the tone and will not be the same film without it. <br /> <br /> Finally , I must comment on the legendary performance of Nicholson ... Jack is terribly convincing as a crazy killer ... In fact, just staring steals a few scenes from this film. The first that must be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> There will be no horror film that matches this movie.
