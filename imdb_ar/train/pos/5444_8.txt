Reunion class jewel comedy underated too. It was 1982 and 1972 for the return of Lizzy Borden, where there was a reunion of 10 years, including the usual stereotypes, a large piece, babe, obese man, but the former students are on a rough night, one of their life classmates is Walter Baloer, a cream class who underwent a comedy joke by the rest of the class on graduation night and has since been in a mental home, Walter is now running away and is planning to avenge his humiliation ,,, <br /> <br /> Despite the hypothesis Dark, but it is really just an excuse for many very funny gags and cutting toys. To say a lot more would spoil the movie, but if you enjoy Naked Gun & Airplane you'll love this movie, and what other film will be making a musical by Chuck Berry? A great comedy deserves a wider audience.
