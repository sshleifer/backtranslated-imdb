"All Through the House" is a special crypt ring, not only because it is the beginning of the first season, but this episode was the first I saw it! I remember when I was a young man on vacation with my father in the summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO, I saw this episode and was buried in Crypt at that time and forever! I was always impressed with the thrilling horror series and I loved the monster movies, and with this series started by HBO, I felt once again with a frightened pleasure. This is the first episode I've ever seen and one of my favorites, it's very fun with a nice touch. The All All the House enjoys a pleasant atmosphere on a snowy Christmas Eve and is a perfect way to make you feel relaxed for a holiday! Well, anyway, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who plays a role in many Warner Brothers, usually small parts) as a greedy trap wife who cares about her husband while waiting for some new money and romance. Just like most horror films take a turn for the worse and bad people get what they deserve. Probabilities accumulate considerably when a maniac dressed in a Santa Claus costume escapes from a local Josie house, making a late Christmas night holiday! From the old comic lessons in EC, bad people learn to get what they say! Well, this tale ends with a perfect holiday cry! Also this story was in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, which is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic encoders of all time!
