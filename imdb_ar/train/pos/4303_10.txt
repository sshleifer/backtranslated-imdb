It is an excellent film with excellent actors and great actors. I'm not tired of watching it. I particularly like the scene, where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Klein's character are Simon and Mac together. Kevin Klein is very natural and his behavior seems not to be uncommon and very confrontational. So it is a very real film. <br /> <br /> However, one of the most powerful scenes in the film is at the beginning of the film when Simon arrives at the scene where the Mac car crashes. The film also contains a strong message and unlike the typical message that carries the film where there is one person who preaches news to the public. Instead, the emotions and attitudes of actors provide an effective message that works better without the use of words. Finally, Mary McDonnell is as wonderful as always.
