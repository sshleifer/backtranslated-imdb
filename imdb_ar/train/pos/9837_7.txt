Zombi 3 has an interesting history in its manufacture. First, it's a sequel to beating the zombie 2, with Zombi 2 itself a marketing stunt of course to deceive people into believing that it was a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, known as Zombi. Is confusing enough? Basically, none of the movies have anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I think Folsi himself started to care about production halfway through Zombi 3 when he decided to go out. Bruno Matte was brought to the painting to help show the film with additional scenes to lengthen the run time. <br /> <br /> The Zombie 3 plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists are developing an outlet on an island in the Philippines, and terrorists are stealing it by unleashing the plague and leaving a coma. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the army is set to cut everyone without prejudice. There are also brief summaries of Radio DJ on how we deal with the planet. <br /> <br /> In general, I really liked this film. I have heard terrible things, but I find the ugly dialogue very enjoyable. The film seems to try to raise awareness about pollution, corrupt army, man who plays the role of God, and so on. I feel that the film was at some time a serious film, but it veered in a strange direction, apparently when Matte appeared on board. <br /> <br /> Along with other zombie flicks, this reminds us of Romero's insanity. "When you see men in white suits and gas masks, you hear the good news." This of course played for pictures of men wearing white zombies. Later, they steal a scene from Crazies where an ordinary person who is not polluted is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> The temptation factor is very good in this scene with zombie hordes in every corner. How cool is it? Let me count the ways? 1. Zombie Birthday 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Bird. 4. Zombie without legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the madness that used the sickle at the gas station. He was a bad ass and demolished the entire building in an attempt to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Preferred quote ?? When the sergeant insists on a coma, the scientists ask, "Do not you think that as soon as ash appears in the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which Sergeant responded boldly, "You are now talking about science fiction." He also goes on to mention the "science fiction" that scientists have told him, even in the end, when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Additions: gallery, trailers and interviews, most notably those with Matte where he insists that he drew 40% of the scenes, yet can not remember any of them or any other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You should see for Zombie fans and Folsi. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
