The film was not great. The book is better. But the film was not too bad. It was interesting to say less. The plot had enough suspense to keep me watching, although I would not say I was really interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Junior are both awesome enough to keep you watching :) They have a few nice scenes that should appeal to the romantic scenes. In general, I will give the film 7 or 8. It was not a bad thing, but a plot lacking wisdom.
