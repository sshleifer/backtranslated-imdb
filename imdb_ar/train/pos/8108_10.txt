I have, "Things Coming", on D.V.D. This is very clear compared to my VHS version. The sound is fair, but sometimes hard to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. I've given details of why some things happened. The best things in the film are the little things I did not notice at first. For example, John Caball plays with a game plane at the Christmas party, as if a dive launcher, out of date for its naval power by naming a warship, "Dinosuar". The ships were sunk by air force, and the enemy's attack was not declared infiltrated by aircraft. Wing aircraft flew flying. Strong rolls for women through the entire film. <br /> <br /> There's more, watch the movie to enjoy it.
