While a little preaching on the subject of progress as a grace to save humanity, it is still a stunning film that symbolizes special films in science fiction that may take another 40 years to reach the silver screen. It foresees the global chaos of World War II, but expands on the premise of conflict in the last 30 years, then tells the story of the struggle of man from under the rubble and into the wilderness of space. The representation seems oddly woody and strangely complex, but this may be the result of its contrast with the visual images that were supposed to be quite impressive at the time of the film's release, which remains impressive today. This is a movie that should not be missed by anyone interested in SF at all.
