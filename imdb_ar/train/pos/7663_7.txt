As a general rule, the Full Moon logo is a warning sign to avoid the movie. But since I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave her a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not wonderful, but that's another thing. The film involves a struggle with a "brother" of a (evil) Sophie who wants to dominate the worlds, and the character of the title. Dr. Murdred must also deal with people and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Potential spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> d. Mordred can move between "dimensions" and do so to find a companion guarding the castle; however, the guard has blinded. His eyes destroyed the pits. So the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, hey, Prestige! His eyes were restored! This type of healing seems to work only with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Murdred and his "brother" move a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> However, besides, the picture is not bad at all, although it is very much like a comic book. Dr. Murdred's most human adventures are fine, and Combs plays her role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
