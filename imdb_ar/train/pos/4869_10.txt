People have no quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have any of these you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that Picasso is the name of a car produced by Citroen, maybe if you see Picasso's painting, you'll just walk by and decide it's a garbage dump for some street painter. :) So do not control, before trying to understand it :) In the end I think everyone should have open minds. Still my N1 remains the Shawshank redemption! Remember, not all objects can be framed. Because there are things in this world, no frame will fit.
