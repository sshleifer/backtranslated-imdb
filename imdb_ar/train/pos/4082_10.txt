Hayao Miyazaki is not equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a storytelling, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. This is unfair, because it is clear through watching Miyazaki films that he is the best artist. He really has a gift of excitement from adults and children, and LaBota is certainly a wonderful trip. <br /> <br /> But where can I begin to describe a magical and impressive film! Miyazaki's work never stopped me. Laputa is a wide-ranging adventure and I wonder how the movie can be filled with detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: If you are a child dreaming of a great adventure in its scope and very magical, what would it look like? The answer is to connect yourself to a seat and what to watch for Abuta, because it is a fantasy reality in childhood. Every minute of the film is rich and lively ... from the chase train to the amazing flight sequence ... and to the wonderful scenery of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent result of Huishaishi's atmosphere! All you want from any adventure movie is here.
