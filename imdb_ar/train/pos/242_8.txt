I thought this movie was very good, Heath Legger was very convincing and his Irish accent was impeccable. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were good and really a friend. How true it really happened, I have no idea, but it depicts why people sometimes do what they do. Maybe those in power were always corrupt and I found it interesting that more than 30,000 people signed a petition not to hang up Ned Kelly, so maybe there was more truth to this film than initially thought? In many ways, "cold mountain" reminded me of another good historical film. In general, I would highly recommend this film and am somewhat puzzled by the lack of improvement in cinematic performance.
