Before movies such as The Texas Massacre, Suspiria, and Halloween have changed forever, there has been a much less violent Gothic era in this genre. Films such as The Hammer of Horror series and Rosemary Baby were what the fans were afraid of during the 1960s and early 1970s. I can not tell you how many times I hired this movie during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. I did not want to confine myself to slasher and zombies in the 1970s and 1980s and movies like this from Amicus, but unfortunately it was a good start. <br /> <br /> FEATURES: Great music and weird. Strong offers of excellent representatives. Great cinematography. Lots of excitement and old fashioned chills, especially in the first and last short essays. Some embarrassing moments and pictures. Moving at a slow but steady pace. The house is a single neuron. A superb design for productions and decorations that give the film a real Gothic horror. It depends on mood and chills that are more bloody than orthopedic and unexplained limp because it is impressive. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Some problems happen in the first half. Apart from the "abaya", the rest of the stories feel that they have been made before. Cliches are plentiful. The second story, "Waxworks", has a good representation and moments, but it is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and suspense. The budget appears really low at times. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in several years, I can see why you hired it so much. It is not a masterpiece in any way, but a good example of the time when horror movies were produced in an elegant and class. Watch this one with the lights. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
