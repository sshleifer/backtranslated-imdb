All of you who have despaired of looking at the emptiness and weakness of the latest productions of Disney Studios, here comes something that will heal your wounds ... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings evidence that pure artificial images that are doing a good script provide more benefit than counterfeit graphics "Which looks like old Disney" (see Lion King and Pocahontas and all the latest products unfortunately regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever). <br /> <br /> The life of A bug's (1001 Pattes for my fellow French filmmakers!) has avoided all the flaws that make you wake up in the middle of the movie and say, "Hey, this thing was created by the computer!" There are no weak parts, a tremendous effort that shows its efficiency in the backgrounds and overall appearance of groups, a stunning three-dimensional bird (close to perfection in imitation of reality) ... and this is only for technical mention. <br /> <br /> The script, my friends, the real backbone of a moving picture, has some fish! Curiously, it is clear that thanks to the Lasseter team, there is virtually no musical sequence in the life of the imbalance. Which means that the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these three or four minutes that some children appreciate, but most others hate (the same for parents or anime lovers, like me). This film reminds me of a really old film featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: Amigo 3; it basically had the same background story. A whole Mexican village lives in fear of some bad guys hiring armed men (who ultimately turn into actors) to protect them. Simple but effective and brilliantly adapted with a colony of fearsome ants that faces the evil insect fury. <br /> <br /> Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales about insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that the life of the bugs is the most extreme and best of all. The process of humanization has been well done ... and the attention of the entire public has been drawn through the adventures of Flik (also known as Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot to Lasseter, especially in the last 30 seconds. .. It is strange and great at the same time to see the whole scene languishing in laughter while forgetting bugs / actors line or collide with the camera ... <br /> <br /> Finally, especially for those of you who have seen the French version, other congratulations to the dubbing actors Who made a big synchronization in this film. Bug life is a good part of entertainment, and I think it'll soon be part of my collection of videos (a very small grant for movies, and that's not a storage room problem :). Go and see, this is something.
