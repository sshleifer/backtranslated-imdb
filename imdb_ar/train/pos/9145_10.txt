Prince plays the role of "child" in this film semi-autobiography of a young talented but narcissistic musician with a life less than the stars. It is true that acting is giving up the required level (with the exception of Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, who are both ideal), but the film is still wonderful and it is better to come out of the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack for any film over at least the last 50 years, lines can be highly quoted, and the trash scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is just stunning. On unrelated, when I saw Prince in a concert in 2004 blew the stadium. He was an expert review man and was one of the best concerts I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Estimated: A <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Disc 1) Comment with director Albert Magnoli Producer Robert Cavallo and Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Trailer Theater; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) 12-minute feature on First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass" (Riffs, Raffs, Revolution: The Impact and Purple Rain effect, 10 minutes and features) MTV premiere footage (when the MTV channel did not absorb donkey balls); 5 videos of Prince music (let's go crazy, take me with you, when the doves cry, I'll die 4 U / Baby I'm a star, Purple Rain); 2 videos by The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird); For and will remain a "Sex Shooter" Apollonia for 6 <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia displays her fine ass titties
