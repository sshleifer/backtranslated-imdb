This is one of those films that make trailers better than feature films. The concept was wonderful and really different, the humor was unique, and I felt there were missed opportunities to put "punch" in this film. I left a lot of lines and gags hanging for a long time, with no specific end, and did not let me really laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Knight & Thurman were excellent. Wanda Sykes was used poorly in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to rotate her character in more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more than renting a DVD. Also, I was looking for a great music video during the final credits, something that became a trademark of these romantic comedy movies, the movie "Something About Mary, Meet Parents" but again, left feeling a little cheated by the fact that this might be a much better film with Music lines punch and a bit more. It looked like he had been moved to the theaters.
