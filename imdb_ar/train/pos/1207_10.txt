I still love him 17 years after the first time I saw her. In fact, I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very angry. Although it is not related to the original version (a child I have never noticed and as an adult I do not care about), this is what the cartoons should be. The darkness is just enough to be interesting and light enough for everyone to enjoy. I am more than happy because my father had Arabani on this kind of thing instead of the cartoons we see today that teach our children something. The music is great, and it hangs in your head forever ... I've downloaded the entire soundtrack at one time or another.
