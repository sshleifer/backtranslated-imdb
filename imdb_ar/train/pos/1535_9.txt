As a student I have been able to watch Diagnostic Killings for several years now. It is basically the doctor who commits the murders with the help of his son LAPD, the young doctor and the pathologist. Dubai Municipality has provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made him different from the many other cop shows and worth seeing many times is his quality and writing. The main actors made good performances and the roots of the artist Dick Dick Dik dwindled using magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were the fast pace, brilliant texts and of course the degree of toe. Unfortunately, I have been unfairly compared to "murder, I wrote." Dubai Municipality is very superior and features more difficult secrets to solve. Now the TV is gone the worst place. Gone are days feelgood, family friendly cop shows. Now there is only depression "brave".
