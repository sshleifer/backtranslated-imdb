I must first admit that I am a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, which is why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, compared to the latest developments, is that it is not just about one page of the band's history (like "I'm trying to break your heart" about Wilco), but rather covering a long period of the band's history. In this film, producer / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed friends / competitors The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995-2003) and a massive video capture 1500 hours of raw video 1:45 hours (The future DVD version will contain more material than the original movie.) The result was amazing - no stuffing - the film is 100% pure and real archive footage, giving you a feeling as the film progresses with the bands, all these years. <br /> <br /> Both teams at the beginning of their career promised to "revolutionize" the music industry, not to sell their souls to the "recording industry" demon. However, their paths diverged rapidly - Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively famous (especially in Europe) after only one album, while the Brian Jonestown Massacre (with its leader Anton Newcombe) melted into oblivion How it is filmed in the film). The film follows the descent of the Brian Johnston massacre, which contrasts with the rise of Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, I was pleased with the film and its approach to the story of Anton Newcomb (for example Troy Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - but after my thinking, I realized there was something wrong in this film.) < The project began in 1995 as a documentary film about many promising emerging groups, in which Anton Neukomb and Andy Timmon were equal partners (which is why all of Undi Timoner throughout this Years he had unintended access to both teams.) It was Anton Newcomb who brought Dandy Warhols to the project, and in the end was completely ignored, I think he was not even aware when the group started the final editing process ... There are always two sides of the story, and here there is only one ... Of course, as expected One, Anton does not agree with the final result and finds that this film is a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is highly biased to Dandy Warhols. Sure, the winner takes everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (DW leader) (Although it seems a good choice - it seems to provide a sense of closer involvement) and that the history of the late gangs is represented by Each disproportionate (BJM is covered until 1997, and DW-2003), does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the film (somewhat shallow). What do you want to teach us? As one critic said: "... a film that looks at old questions: Where does genius fit with a commodity world? Can it grow and achieve the return, or does it need self-destruction to keep it safe?" No, he does not check these questions! It only portrays a brilliant, but unsuccessful, musical story, told by a less intelligent but successful person who indulges in the self-confidence and eternal cold of an ego greater than the mountain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun - it's rough, it's new, neat, it's ... God's curse is interesting, at least for fans of DW or BJM. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
