At first, it looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when it got to what seemed like a really funny film. The two former comedians were Willie Clarke (Golden Globe winner, Oscar and BAFTA nominee Walter Matthau), Lewis (Oscar-winning actor and Golden Globe candidate George Burns), two great comedians, and brought together to revive the hospital's painting for a television show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clarke (the award-winning Golden Globe Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can meet again without any difficult feelings for each other and how wrong he is. They can not go on all the time, they all forgot, especially during the conversation, but they do it in the end. He starred as Lee Meredith as nurse in Sketch, Carol Deloise as Doris Green, Alles Dorz, Rosita Lenoir as Odyssey, Willie and Moppets from Morris Abraham. I think the best line in the film is Burns mentioned that Matao called him "son of a bitch bastard". He was nominated for the Oscars for the best collection of works of best film directing and writing adapted from other materials. He was nominated for the BAFTA Best Screenplay and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Film - Musical / Comedy Best Screenplay. very good!
