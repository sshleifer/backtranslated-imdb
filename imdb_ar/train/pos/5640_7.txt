I really think this movie is wonderful, personally. But, in every movie there is Downer. Now, perhaps some of you have not seen the song "Raise Your Voice" by Hillary Dove, but if you think about it, these two scenes are very similar, if you know what I mean. In "A Brave New Girl," Holly wants to reach the Haverty Museum. In "Raise Your Voice", Terry wants to go to the Los Angeles Conservatory (do not mention the name of the music institute there). Both are in the music field, and they sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films look alike. Personally I like "Brave New Girl" better than, "raise your voice".
