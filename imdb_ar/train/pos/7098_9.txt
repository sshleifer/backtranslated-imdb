"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become a masterpiece of Gilliam Terry. Fantastic screenplay, constant rhythm, sometimes clever sarcastic dialogues. Moreover, he had a good nose around the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis is the kind of character he played in his previous films. Here, a zigzag and hopeless figure that can be called a prisoner who is captured by a hero knows no fear and invincible (as in the case of "die hard"). Whatever he tries, he is a prisoner of time. The film has a very exciting ending as well. I've got a real dramatic power. But this wonderful film is also a reflection of man, and the dangers he fears (especially those that can cause the end of the world, here, these viruses can cause diseases). No matter how long it takes, twelve monkeys will be valued for their true value: one of the masterpieces created in the 1990s.
