I loved the movie loved the two families crossing paths in history. The only question is whether Sam was killed so how can his family line continue? He is the son of Mrs. Zerouni and it is assumed that Zero is linked but does not mention any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Did not mention any other children or wife before talking to and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child before she became kissing Kate thieves? Even with mistakes in the film. Just loved it. The acting was wonderful. I'm not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir Marion being a woman in the end, but he makes his character more entertaining. The other "counselor" seems to be interested in children but of course not much. A poor janitor must have had a really stifling childhood to be moderate when she grew up.
