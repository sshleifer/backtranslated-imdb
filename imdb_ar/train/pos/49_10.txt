If you "understand" it will be great. <br /> <br /> If you do not, it will be right. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you have gone through school shooting. There is so much in this film that sometimes shooting at school becomes unimportant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a film about accepting, superficially, a painful event, but also for people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It is also a film about the insurmountable pain and how different people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's fury and Diana's obsession creates an atmosphere of concrete anxiety in the middle of the film and wonders how the director can pull a happy ending from his hat. Fortunately, the public is credited with being human; our intelligence is not insulted by an absurdly naive moral end. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I try to keep a clear view of the fact that the films are fictional and all that. However I must admit, I cried like a small child lost during this film. There were some things on the subject that struck * very close to the house and opened some old wounds that had not completely healed. But this is not necessarily a bad thing.
