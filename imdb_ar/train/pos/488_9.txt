Part of the fun I got from this film came from the fact that I knew nothing more about her than starring John Tortoro and Emily Watson (two reasons to watch), part time and chess. Everything that developed before me was totally unexpected. So, I will not give up more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is wonderful as an eccentric chess genius, very obsessed and weak, and he is matched by a step-by-step approach as the powerful, mental woman to whom he is attracted. It's about love and mania, not the board game, and after it gradually attracted me for the first half hour, it became quite convincing. I challenge anyone to guess the end.
