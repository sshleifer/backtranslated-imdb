The man about the home is a comedy real situation in every sense of the word. The comedy is about a character named Robin Tripp (played by Richard or Sullivan the Great) who finds himself after a wild party, and ends up in the house of two ladies calling Joe and Churchi. Ironically, the party was set up to say farewell to his old colleague. The obvious thing is that it happens during his transition. <br /> <br /> The man on the house was a forerunner of Cooke and Mortimer on George and Mildred's show, which showed the two people who owned Joe, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters will in fact be transformed into a series of characters from the house with Mildred (the late Yotah Joyce, who has been largely missed) in particular for the best lines of the series. Larry (Doug Fisher) was a near-useless character who was always screaming and never came when he wanted to borrow something (and never bring it back). <br /> <br /> The Americans have made a copy called the Three Company, but they do not stop when compared to this funniest asset. The Times thought of producing a comedy about a man sharing an apartment with two women in a very conservative time, but they should be concerned because assessments at the time suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to see a little old-fashioned comedy with inspired casting and sharp text. What unfortunate modern comedies can not reach to this high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on a DVD on the network
