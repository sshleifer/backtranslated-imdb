"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I have ever seen. It is a wonderful combination of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film contains some wonderful photos and wonderful battles. The scene between Wu Ma and the tongue demon tree. Really original movie and refreshing and recommending other fine Embalmer.
