I watched this movie for the first time when I was a young kid and I fell in love once. The groups hold their breaths and some of the texts are completely written: "You are the children of a thousand fleas." <br /> <br /> It is always shown on TV late at night or in the early morning of the morning at about 3:00 am once it has just started. TV companies need to show more respect and put it in peak times on Sunday so everyone can get a chance to see this good work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
