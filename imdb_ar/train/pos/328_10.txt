I came close to being curious (yellow), a piece of great fear. I have read many reports about the widely touted controversy and frank sex. What I got was not this, but a cinematic experience is exciting and thought-provoking unlike any other experience. I honestly believe that the majority of commentators who felt that the film was "lame" or "boring" approached the film as if it were a pornographic content. These may be pornographic materials, assuming that pornography is something that is intended to excite the senses, but is not intentionally sensational. Lina, the hero of the novel, aims all of them to perform, giving them a realistic, convincing and lasting humanity. Her breasts may be fluffy, her breasts unusually large, her thighs fat, her face chubby. But by the end of the film, the audience comes to know them, accepting their mistakes as a human being. This touch gives it greater credibility. If the director threw a bomb at Brigitte Bardot, the effect would have been canceled. I can not strongly recommend this erotic idea. Be prepared to invest a lot of thinking in this deliberate film. The patient and the humble viewer will be rewarded in ways that most other films might dream of.
