I just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, to restore things, this film does not pretend to be anything other than hard work. Comedy film. Not aimed at revolutionizing the film industry and rallying praise from critics and not wanting to be considered one. If you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, I suggest you ignore your critical mind and hinder you into a good plot because you will not find anything here. In doing so, let's go deeper into the film. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this film just because he did not have a strong plot (yes, filmgoers, I have played down the importance of this film as well), but I never expected to enjoy myself much for this film. I enjoyed this more than Stephen Chao's clicks (which I find Kung Fu Hustle his best effort and have rated it as 9). The movement is narrow and epic while the comedy chokes to the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think the action may be unrealistic, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie anyway? There are a lot of other sports movies (drama) that have already been very successful, why did they produce other films? The spoilers end <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why you read this. Go ahead and watch it. Just remember, do not think - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, <br /> <br /> Every once in a while (the film industry) create masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, sometimes making movies that are Better off in the pile of dump. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the appreciation of previous examples, and then again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow-ish, this is one of the top ten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend if you love: - No thinking movies with really good work - Kung Fu - Death Troupe - Kung Fu and Comedy - What the heck, watch this. You will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 For you the Kung Fu Dunk team. ^ _ ^
