This is the movie I've seen more times than any other film (I think I've seen it on average once every year since its release). Every time I see her, she is equally wonderful and always reveals something new to me. The cast was probably the best mix ever in the previous U Cinema. This film is an absolute necessity for any film lover who respects himself. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker for movies that everyone must enjoy in his own collection of videos.
