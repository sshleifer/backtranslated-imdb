Tom Hanks was in successful films such as Forrest Gump, Save Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good men whom we encourage. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis is slightly different. <br /> <br /> In the movie Sam Mendes "Road to Perdition" based on a novel by Max Allan Collins, the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. The different thing about this small wild trip is that Sullivan is a killer being hunted by his former partner. His former boss or boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his son, Conner Sullivan's partner (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After work was done wrong because of Connor, Sullivan and his son, who was not supposed to be there, saw him wrong. So Connor tries to get Sullivan and his family out, but only gets the wife and her son Peter. Sullivan beats the ball and runs home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... sitting. With the death of his wife and child, Sullivan went to the road to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows Monday as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and son, and Michael, who feels like he is responsible for all this. He was lucky to kill his mother and brother. Tyler Hweklin is doing a great job where Michael Jr. brings maturity and the feeling that he is still young. The loss of his innocence is good as he travels from one city to another, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> The previous film by Mendes was American Beauty, which won five Oscar awards including best film and best director. The film was not nearly as successful at the Oscars and won only one prize for the best film, but got five more nominations for music and sound and the best actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story that takes you on a journey across the Midwest and in the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, killer man, and faithful father. This movie is a sleeping movie that you should watch for years to come.
