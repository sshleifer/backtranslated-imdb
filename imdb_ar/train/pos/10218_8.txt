We must remember that the 1950s were practically an empty list when it comes to movies. Hollywood was in transition from National War films, Noir, Oval Oats, etc. to films bearing a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, on waterfront, and so on. Some people may think that this was an improvement. I do not. Who was the leader who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. This psychological excitement is less comfortable than the kind of telemedicine. <br /> <br /> This one is a point. She is about three sisters trying to wrest control of the property of her dead father. One of them, perhaps the only one who deserves redemption, is assisted by a pilot company to help them keep the rest of the family in the Gulf. It's initially for dollars, but it's finally for her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans to subvert romance. The results are predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension among sisters. The masochism is a little hidden. Legacy crazy - if there is such a thing. We have never been able to meet parents, but they must have failed. One or two actors look vaguely familiar. The representation is too bad to believe. It was released under the umbrella of United Artists by a company called Bel-Air Productions. He was shot in and around Los Angeles, mostly at night and probably without permits. The end was so strange that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of the scene. <br /> <br /> I can not explain it - not even to myself - but I was given this 8/10 trash heap. I am familiar with the term "It's very bad, it's good", but I do not think I've ever faced this phenomenon. Well, maybe "hot rods to hell", but this one certainly fits. You may want to try this if you like movies that look like they were made in someone's cellar.
