At first, I felt very vague about the lyrics of the first film, then became completely enchanted by the story unfolding, and became involved in the wonderful output. All the characters have been developed in full, not larger than life, but just like the people we live with anywhere in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey, or in America, all of whom are totally believable with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood can learn a lot from this beautiful film. It explains that there is no need to enter all the small details behind each movement to show the entire subject clearly and brightly, and this indicates the brilliance of the director! I hear thanks to Kay Pollack and the wonderful actors for this wonderful treatment !!
