Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy scientific television series. <br /> <br /> There are no survival facts. Stargate SG-1 is still a science fiction TV series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 leverages ideas and steals them quickly. The FX program is not nearly as effective as it could have been and the procedure will not drive you out of the chair. Or you can take advantage of this issue as well. <br /> <br /> But, here I think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit you can get for every episode or stolen idea that I think you can count on at least one science fiction movie that is worse than an hour-long TV episode . <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes may actually take 90 minutes and are still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> The ability to maintain this quality throughout the presentation and continue to make and pay more of the story is what makes the Stargate SG-1 distinctive. <br /> <br /> I am very upset with my choices. I probably follow a series or two television series at most, and I comply with very high standards which made me feel surprised when I found myself caught. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush from Stargate SG-1 yet another sci-fi science fiction, no. Stick to it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
