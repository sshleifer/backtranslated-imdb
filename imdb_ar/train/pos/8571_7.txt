It can be said that this "sequel" is very good, better than the first film Direct 101 mottled. She has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all the correct jokes! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has been treated fairly well, is a dog lover and pleasant to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs that Krola once tried to kill, do not believe so. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of the second chance shelter for dogs) believe they have changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his teammate, has developed three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (Glamorous Parrot), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (baddie) Idea), this is a good family movie with excitement and lots more !! One fall in this film is that it has a lot of painful aching, but not overly like the last film. This is also the most entertaining of the last film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
