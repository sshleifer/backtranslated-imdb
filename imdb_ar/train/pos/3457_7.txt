This is Colombo, directed by Steven Spielberg at an early stage of his career. There is nothing impressive but you can see some small hints of the great things coming to Spielberg in this film. The film is essentially the same as most of 70's 1970s films and television works. This means that some characters tend to show some weirdness, and I'm not just talking about the character of Colombo alone. This kind of personal oddity is perhaps best seen in Spielberg's 1975 film "Jaws". But aside from some small hints of typical Spielberg elements, you can not describe this film as a successful work and a great example of a rising star. This is not bad, of course not, as I said earlier, not also anything impressive. <br /> <br /> This film started very well and was very promising but after it opened well, which as always, the crime occurred, the film became slow and boring to watch as well. It's boring because it's mostly a Colombian film that has no real moments to forget, and it's not boring because it's a boring film to watch. <br /> <br /> The crime itself was very creative and the concept of possession. The author of the murder story of his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential. But the story did not explore all its potential. At least this is the feeling that this film left me. <br /> <br /> The film was still good to see, though, thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who is thought to be smarter and then Colombo, because of his ambiguity / crime writing experience and trying to give him all sorts of possible hints, and keep away from himself. But of course Colombo is better known as the first suspect from the very first moment, but he plays as usual in the game. <br /> <br /> The movie enjoys a good overall style and uses some precise camera mode editing. It is funny that most of these things are consistent with Spielberg's subsequent work, especially some camera angles. <br /> <br /> Colombo's movie is absolutely wonderful and enjoyable but do not let Spielberg's name accompany it as it raises your expectations for it too. <br /> <br /> 7/10
