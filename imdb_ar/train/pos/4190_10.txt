Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just finished watching it again. I could not become emotionally in her final scene. Did not get an Academy Award. That's why you should not put much faith in the Oscars. Richard Widmark had no better part and was ideal in acting as a flawed three-dimensional object. Jean Peters was as wonderful as the cruel girl on the street in her best role at all. Richard Kelly should be very good. Why did you hate him as well. Yes, it was heavy on national. But without it, you do not have many movies. Watch their faces! The first three stars do not need much text. I would like to see them doing this film without dialogue. If you've seen Ray Milland and Rita Jam in "The Thief", you might know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 on my first trip to New York City, I made my uncle Bronx take us to the foot of South Street to look for No. 66. That's when I knew that you could not trust Hollywood. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I will not give up much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it myself. If you have seen it, it is not necessary to clarify. Perhaps only, someone who has not read these comments has not seen "Pickup On South Street". Just do not go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
