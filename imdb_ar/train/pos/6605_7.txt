2054. Paris is an Escher ship with people and vehicles traveling on multiple levels in a clear tribute to Fritz Lang Metropolis. Paris is both modern and collapsing in decay. In the vagueness of surveillance, a young medical researcher is abducted after her sister's departure directly at an unnatural nightclub. A tough police chief achieves. They appear in bold black and white, with dark corridors, dark alleys, and characteristic of individual lighting characteristic of the most boiling noures. Comparisons with Sen City are inevitable. But the story goes back to Masamon Shiro and William Gibson than Frank Miller, because high-tech surveillance, semi-invisible stealth suits and ruthless companies are part of the landscape as much as guns and cars. The film never creates an atmosphere of Gibson's online vision. His high-tech marginal characters are intertwined with the industrial types of companies that all seem to have their own ministry of fear, but the viewer certainly feels that Paris is a future rather than a utopia and a science of the future. As the police procedural line unfolds, we are taken at intervals that are darker than the individual ambition beneath the glowing crust of Avalon's public relations image. The motion capture process used here takes a look somewhere between the B & W comic books and the next generation rotoscoping, which is either attractive or intrusive according to your taste. However, there is a wonderful visual sensation presented here, and the future of Paris is full of fine details that give the picture a unique look, which in turn turns both Spartan and Baroque. Well worth a look.
