It was not sophisticated, and no one in credit had a wonderful career, but as a whole, because there are no celebrities; the film looks more realistic than some high-budget films and well-polished films. <br /> <br /> The film, produced for a few dollars and worth watching, should give hope to all those who will be filmmakers and prize-winners. The problem with this film is that it was made in the worst possible time. Television was the revenue of the film industry, and it could easily have been shown on television. In 1950, all the fare on television was eligible for a "G" rating. The film industry has begun producing more "adult" movies that can not be shown on television during the days when television does not dare show sex and skin in commercials today.
