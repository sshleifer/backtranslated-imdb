I cried my heart, watching this movie. I have never had any eating disorder, but I think this should be a very real picture. <br /> <br /> Allison Lehman is excellent! It expresses these feelings surprisingly. Years of adolescence have returned to me very clearly. Anyone who has a difficult time as a child or teenager will be able to link to this movie. I recommend you all see it! <br /> <br /> Music is also wonderful - I've just discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I also look forward to seeing Allison Lehmann in White Ol√©ander, because I am sure she is perfectly suited to the role of Agnes.
