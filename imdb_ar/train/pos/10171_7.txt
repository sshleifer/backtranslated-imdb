Once when I was in college and had an international exhibition, the Russian section had a poster from the Soviet era saying "Ne boltay!" , Means "no chatter!". I translated it for the "generation" of television monitors as "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (In reference to the curious neighbor on "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of gossip in the soldier. Snafu short "rumors", you see it is not a matter of laughing. In this case, the soldier who does not always last for the bombing is heard and assumes immediately that the Axis forces have attacked the United States. So, tell someone, tell someone else, tell someone else, and continue. As in "Russians are coming, the Russians are coming," the story is blown more and more every time, so that when you return to Snafu ... Well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly propaganda for World War II - complete with an insulting term for the Japanese - but I must say that soldier. Snafu pants were actually very funny. Of course, since they wrote Dr. Suss and Mill Blanc to provide votes, it is not surprising that these sounds are quite impressive. worth watching.
