It's cheesy, creepy, heavy, but that makes it very fun. I have passed Melodrama moments which are just funny. This movie is wonderful to make fun of. He hired her to laugh well. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on three news anchors, over a long period of time before mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to stay at night. When they meet with Ernst Keller. It is creepy in a psychological way. And allows them to stay at home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> The performance of Stephen Forrest is very amazing like "Unseen", because it really holds this film. Most of the film is boring, although discovering the truth of the Ernest family is interesting. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this actor in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Bar make a nice dessert. <br /> <br /> I consider the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth watching.
