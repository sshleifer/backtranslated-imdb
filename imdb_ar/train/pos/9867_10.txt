I first saw Ice Age at the Subiaco cinemas when I came out, in 2002. I was only 13 years old at that time, but until then I liked it. There was a kind of warmth. <br /> <br /> We've watched it on the video for several years now, and no matter how many times you see it, it's never boring. This is because the only element that makes it different from all other 3D animations that were made at the time - not for certain "home" characters they leave. They are nomads, and this is refreshing and really exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Also, each individual figure on the surface seems to coexist with each other, but they are all close friends. Well, all the characters have their own charm (even the bad guys). The master of laziness is enchanting in his way of spam, very loving and naive. Manny is loved in his lonely depressed personality and so on. <br /> <br /> Another important point in the film is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters are originally designed with clay, giving the film a technical advantage. <br /> <br /> Another aspect adds to the film's feeling, that sex means little. There are almost no female characters, but you do not really realize that even after watching it several times and then it will have little impact on the way the movie is shown. Because of this, there is also no mention of a nuclear family that would be truly pathetic in an environment like the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> In general, Ice Age is a great movie and an indication of how much effort has been put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles.
