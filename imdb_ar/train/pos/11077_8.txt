First of all, do not go to Revolver expecting to be Snatch or Lock Stock post, this is a different kind of gangster movies. <br /> <br /> I watched the celebration last night and this film definitely divides the audience. It's a kind of film where half of the audience will think what it is? That was bad, and the other half would leave thinking what was that? That was great. Personally I like movies I do not understand, like Mulholland Drive and the usual suspects, so I enjoyed the gun. <br /> <br /> Certainly not perfect. I've seen a great development a mile away, at least part of it, and although sometimes I left some unexplained loose ends good, but the gun leaves a lot of unexplained questions for no reason. Also some scenes, such as animation, scene where Sorter goes in a wave kill (actually one of my favorites), although great sights to watch, seem to be just because they were fantastic to watch, not because they fit with the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there were many goodies too. I thought the acting was fantastic from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastor, and even Andre Benjamin (who was pleasantly surprised). This film certainly kept my interest, with a wonderful, exciting, and full-motion scene, one after the other. When Ray Liotta was being held under the table F. Well, you have to see him. The script was executed very well, and the soundtrack, as with most Guy Ritchie movies, was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although it is a step closer to movies such as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, a great action film is fast and psychological, with many twists and turns and many scenes to remember for a long time after the film ends.
