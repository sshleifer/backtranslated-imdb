Another attempt by contemporary Japanese managers to redefine the type of Shambra. Successful, not, to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has the vision that he is killing a mythical (and very active) demon at the Gojoe Bridge in order to achieve Enlightenment. Although Buddhist thought is not in the foreground, it is located at the heart of this film, such as "Ran" Kurosawa. Maybe what made the film is the most interesting for me though it is close to the "Ran" league. <br /> <br /> The elegant visual trend and excellent photography keep the movie enjoyable for 2 to 18 minutes. Excellent leading actors uniformly. The music is really good. Weaknesses are the story and scenes of fighting. The film is pulled in the middle and could be repaired with some subtle modifications. The scenes of fighting are often filmed up close. This works for most of the movie but the end looks like a trick. Another film like this is Cui Swords' Sword of Swords, but the scenes of the promised fighting are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demon carrying a sword, but his representation is wonderful but he will be extra in the traditional chambara fight scene. <br /> <br /> A good movie, maybe you'll find it interesting just don`t expect traditional sword battles.
