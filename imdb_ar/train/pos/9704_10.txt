I can not believe it has been ten years since this show was first introduced on television and viewers are happy with a unique blend of comedy and horror. This is the presentation that generated a large part of contemporary British humor: d. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace; The Great Bush Snuff Fund. Many have imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny that some have exceeded its quality. But Jeremy Dyson deserves to be remembered for starting the trend, with actors Gates, Steve Pemberton and Riss Shermsmith. <br /> <br /> Together they set up Royston Vassy, ​​a wicked little town in England's poetic countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by couple Husain want to keep the city free from outsiders; Where a veterinarian kills all the animals he is trying to treat; a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but does not resist food to connect people with it. <br /> <br /> This is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in The League of Gentlemen. As such, the three actors give birth to dozens of unique characters. Make-up and artificial limbs are very good and I think I actually see far more actors in the show than their number. But he is also a wonderful actor: the way they change their voices and physical movements, they become really other people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start with something ordinary, from real life, then blowing on something worrisome, sometimes intestinal. Sometimes it is sheer horror without preparation, as in the character of Papa Lazaro. Just imagine a creepy circus make-up as he wanders around someone's house and kidnaps women to be his wife. There is no specific explanation. This is creepy. Then there are many references to horror films: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Fans of horror will love her, and she will love comedy lovers. As any traveler knows, there is a sign saying "Welcome to Royston Vasey: You will never leave." Any exhibitor giving this offer a chance will agree. Once you discover the League of Gentlemen, you will never want anything else, and you will never forget it.
