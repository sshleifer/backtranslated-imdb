Rarely, these days, finding a romantic comedy does not worry incredibly in short doses throughout the entire film (such as Big Fat Greek Wedding; I, Myself and Irene). There were only two unnecessary malicious jokes in this movie, nothing unclean non-addicted. Everywhere, it was a nice movie with beloved characters. I thought the end was a bit surprising. It seems like they should have finished this in the world series to get a real final touch. The representation left slightly to the desired level, but was compensated by the speed of the story. If I knew it was Farrelly Brothers movie I'd assume it was a piece of metal that turned out of trash and I did not watch it, but they seemed so capable of making a fine film. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads to the rest of the way and start producing good movies constantly.
