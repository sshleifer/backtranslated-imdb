I have enjoyed every single episode of the Pushing Daisies this season, and I hope that the writers' strike will not brutally end the beginnings of a very good show. Ned is a pie maker who has a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emerson is a special investigator with his unique tricks such as his love for knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is a childhood friend who was dead in the past and is no longer a sunny place in Ned's life. The olive waitress is jealous but kindhearted. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Del combines all the characters with his brilliant novel of the show. Chuck Wand and Emerson with Oliv and sometimes the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the help of the special gift of returning the dead to life. The show is funny, clean and romantic in a very nice and good-hearted way, and I recommend it to anyone.
