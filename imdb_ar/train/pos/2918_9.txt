I saw it on the cable back in the late 1980s where I was a big wrestling enthusiast since 1986. I saw this on the VHS in a "for sale" box and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and I always come back to watch this order to see how it was a very accurate picture of people who participated in wrestling (families and friends do not understand us, travel, heartbreak), etc. ). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch because no one can understand what a genius is creative. A great way to separate himself from the Fonz character he played at Happy Days at the time. In addition, see the actors ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holly (Alice), wrestlers Rudy Piper and Father Shaviro Guerrero.
