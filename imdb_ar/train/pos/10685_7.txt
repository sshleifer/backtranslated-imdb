This film has a clear story, which is unusual for the genre. "Cats," "Phantom of Opera," and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical, because they use literary works as their framework. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) summarizes the essence of human relations, especially relations between the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on a supposed fictional novel, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" of Indonesian adults. Dance chains are not perfect, yet the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I think the dance designer should explore Indonesian dance, not fearing that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more Western. Dance sequences look awkward in some respects and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. However, I still love this film and consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genre which I hope will improve in the future.
