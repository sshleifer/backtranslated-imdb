This film was released by Roger Kurman, so you know that filmmakers did not have much money to work with them. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the minute details in this film because of the "very obsessed" model of killer marketing style, there are unique differences about this film. <br /> <br /> Amanda, as Justin Priestley obviously played, is a complex figure. Some people like these films precisely because violence can seem random, but here are the implications of past abuse (which is dealt with in a realistic but delicious way) that constitute Amanda's psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda eventually re-produces love from love, where most of these films turn into a typical full-blown fight to death, and the evil character dies just as evil in the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the coarse edges in this picture, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thinking and grace, originality compared to the usual - especially on the budget.
