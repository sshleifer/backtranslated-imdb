This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking, taking you to the lives of long-time lovers in the final stages of AIDS. The 20-year-old footage of the strange together will truly bring their last moments home. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not make you feel pain and these two wonderful people, you do not have a heart.
