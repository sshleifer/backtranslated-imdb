I thought the film was very good for a TV movie, and it contained a lot of excitement and humor. I found the entertainment value worth watching, and I will see it again or a similar offer again. I am disappointed that Shawn was not credited here for IMDb. <br /> <br /> I can see the possibility of a business chain based on this concept or supplement with Shawn playing again for higher "cash" stakes, since his life was at stake again anyway. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played the role very well, and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford playing Jack Devereaux in our days - soap opera.
