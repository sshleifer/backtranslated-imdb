No, not really, but this is a very good film, which is unfortunately a forgotten gem. Fits black and white film. <br /> <br /> A straight forward combination, the man was suffering from plague and the authorities must track everyone who was in contact with him before his death. <br /> <br /> Very well directed, and the representation is great. Richard Widmark is a good leader for the man, but Paul Douglas is fully acting as a police chief, Jack Palance (better off) and Mostel's ministers as people who killed them. Palance unfortunately went to play similar characters in some gangster movies or war in the second class really.
