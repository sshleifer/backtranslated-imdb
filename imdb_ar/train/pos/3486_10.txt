Any real wrestling fan should consider that this is one of the best wrestling, if not the best at all. It was full of excitement and surprises. It was one of the greatest matches ever between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest Mike Tyson reference. Michaels's presentation was unbelievable, especially in view of the way he appeared and that was his last game.
