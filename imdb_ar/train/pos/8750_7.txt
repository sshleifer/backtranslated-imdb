Brokedown Palace is the story of two close friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and end up in jail after being caught on drugs planted in their bags. In this way, the film had the ability to transform into a serious and sexy film, such as "Going Back to Heaven," but instead the film chose to focus a little on the status of girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Clare Danis and Kate Beckinsal play a wonderful role, and the film revolves around their interaction - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing of friendship, and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This film chooses not to go into politics deeply or even harshly in prison life (which has been a bit vague), and focuses more on these issues of friendship. <br /> <br /> There have been some conspiracy holes here, some parts that do not look reasonable or realistic. We did not feel real fear or despair of their situation as well as we may have. We feel very little outside the walls of the prison, where Bill Pullman plays the supposed role of a lawyer who is in fact turning into a heart of gold. In short, this was, by all accounts, a darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story of the story had enough twists and turns to remain enjoyable. worth watching.
