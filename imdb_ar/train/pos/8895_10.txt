"It's a really great film that makes people learn about the history of Americans in the Vietnam War, the power of Venus, and the fight against racism ... It illustrates the intergenerational, political and racial conflict of the 1960s. I was born in 1980 so I did not know all these things before ... In France, the history of the USA is not so a priority and this film really learned me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more than once every day !! It is really wonderful .... What a shame, only appeared on TV and not in movie theaters ... <br /> <br />
