Diane Keaton has played several "heavy" parts in her many years on the big screen, but she is often known for "light and gentle" things with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. She deserves the Academy Award for Best Actress in Drama for this effort, and it does not really matter what the competition was in the year it was first introduced. Try and find a scene that does not appear in it. Each drama was heavy, cumbersome at the pace and restored, and the movement, all at full speed. She made her makeup as small as possible and fit the age group of 30 even in the close, but she was playing half her age and very quickly. The film, in general, was fairly good, where it was introduced and shot well with a strong support team but Keaton carried the burden.
