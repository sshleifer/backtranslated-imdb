In addition to the fact that my favorite filmmakers list is: 1) Allamighty 3) The rest ... This film is actually better than the book (and TV series although this is a very easy work, looking at the director). There is no doubt that brilliant music - impeccable cinematography and skill (Kubrick in all the early ages) - make it a masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV series a few years ago and I liked the story and I hoped so when I got a comment. Dawn me away !!! It is much better than I imagined. It starts slowly (Kubrick's commercial mark) and has a lot of wasted time that adds to the thrill. The presentation is classic by all standards, I have seen it only about 20 times for the storytelling atmosphere that it inspires throughout the film. Also the movie does not offer a lot of nonsense (it has just enough and not in any way tasteless) direction which I hate in horror movies lately. Just watch it!
