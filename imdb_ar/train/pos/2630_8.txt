"The King King" is undoubtedly Disney's favorite film of all time, so I figured I should give the disciples an opportunity and did it. Lion King was 1/2 1/2 well and was laughing well and having fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem, I feel sometimes there is no need for clarification because it can create holes in the plot and just desire to explain your. Well, I strongly recommend this movie to Lion King fans or just a night with the family. It's a fun flick with the same laugh and beloved characters as the first. So, I hope I get the same third installment of the Lion King series. Rest and think only Hakuna Matata! I mean do not worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
