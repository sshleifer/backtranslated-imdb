The sudden impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's technical failure at a stage of his career when he established a reputation as a director. The reason is not the film itself, but the attitude it takes towards the vigilance it seems to support. In some places, Death Wish is credited more than the original Dirty Harry movie. One can argue if this is the case at the end of the day, it is a film about guilt, justice and revenge. To me, at the end of the day, empathy is more than sympathy. However, in the light of all these arguments, the sudden effect is easily overlooked is a wonderful film-made. Forget "go ahead punk, make my day scene", this is ingenious but not original. But look at San Fransisco's views from the air, to enlarge the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes is very spectacular. Or take a look at the scene brilliantly where the character of Sondra Locke visits her mental sister at the hospital. Eastwood benefits from highly overlapping faces. In general, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that truly shows Eastwood's maturity as a director. If I remember correctly, it was the first time Eastwood had shown it on the screen, albeit in an action film about a debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first fast-paced Eastwood film directed. Although Eastwood has tremendous talent as a director, the play has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The space of narration leads to the integration of visual elements well into the film and not distracting attention from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog gutters.
