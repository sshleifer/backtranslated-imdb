The lawyer is drawn to the deadly game of cat and mouse when he gets involved with the fatale femme in this modification of the Gresham novel. Altman creates an interesting Gothic atmosphere, but the scenario is weak. Branagh mediates the role of the Southern lawyer, a persuasive motive, and an attractive Davids as a goal of his will. Downey is lovable as a private detective. Duval plays a small role that does not allow him to play a strange character. Hannah and Beringer walk around admiringly. After an interesting setup, the film stumbles and does not fulfill its initial promise, but Altman always deserves a look.
