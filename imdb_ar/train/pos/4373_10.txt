I ask anyone who says they do not care about this film. Some reviewers said there was not enough action, some said it was too long, and so on. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The performances are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lange are allsuperb William Nison does a great job and is a very dignified figure because of his size. The filming was fantastic and amazing. It is among the few films I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that were virtually flawless from acting, directing, writing, acting, etc. T in the best 50 or 100 movie reviewed. I felt so passionate about it that I logged on to IMDB so I could tell everyone the real shovel. I have watched this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and have loved it all! You must be awake and pay good attention for the first 30 minutes as they provide quite a number of characters at first. If you have a longer interest than most of these young children who write reviews for movies on this site, you will love this movie! Come on ... all Lord of the Rings three movies on top 9 and matrix in # 32?!?! You should be shown the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> It's the best 50 movies !!!
