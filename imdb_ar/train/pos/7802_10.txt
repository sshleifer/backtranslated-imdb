I felt electrocuted when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Stephen Pico disappeared midway through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is unforgettable. I did not do that when I was finally in South Africa in 1993. It's also a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance concert in Natal Nkosi Sikelel 'iFrika, my hair stopped at the end. There is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.
