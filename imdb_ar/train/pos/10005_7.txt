Yes, it is a work of art ... to make the slow rhythm movie successful. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in large sizes while you do not notice it. <br /> <br /> Good performance by Robin Williams. The corners of sexual activity in the film may seem unnecessary and may affect how much you enjoy in the movie. However, the basic plot is very attractive. The film does not rush to you and continues to impress you enough to keep you wondering. The good direction of using lights to achieve the desired effects of suspense and uncertainty is good. <br /> <br /> Enjoy watching very nice once if you are looking forward to lying down and hearing an exciting short story!
