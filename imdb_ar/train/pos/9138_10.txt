I own this movie and have seen it many times over the years since its release. The Prince did not surprise us with his amazing style of acting or anything, he is a musician and I feel that this is what he has presented here. He is only the best person to tell this story through influence. Most of this film is clear and direct but this is a mistake directors / writers, it is still a wonderful film with better music. The basic principles and moral convictions of Purple Rain are very strong. If more films are based on the basics we learn as young children, we will have a better environment throughout the environment, where art is a reflection of life that reflects art.
