This film illustrates the worst part of the remaining war, Memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I remember my parents and brothers returning from World War II. One of the war uncles is not over yet. He survived the D-Day invasion, similar to the first 20 minutes of rescuing Ryan. For him the memories were not only left but tortured. He became an alcoholic as many of my cousins ​​did, his sons. Jump forward 60 years and put soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw it at KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there were some things about war that never changed. Ideal young men and women are spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, especially if you are against the war. It will disappear with more sympathy because the soldiers there who try to do what they believe or are told are right. <br /> <br /> The tag line from the Vietnam War movie says the platoon. "The first victim of war is innocence."
