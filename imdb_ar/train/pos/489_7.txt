While walking home after the film, I was dancing on the familiar waltz music Natalia and Alexander were dancing. I heard it before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), I got it just as I reached the door. It is "No. 2 Waltz of Jazz Suite No. 2" by Dimitry Shostakovich, performed here by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Prague. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack of the tower. What a treat! Alexandre Desplat's result has been met - there are 15 songs along with two great waltz tracks. These days, we often get a full-blown soundtrack. Reminds me of the favorite results of Maurice Garre, Annio Moriconi (track 6 starts with an impact from Novo Paradiso), George Delero and John Barry. There are subtle subtle differences of breeds and notes of tendons, celestial, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Tortorro have provided reliable double-consumer performance. The story of love, their intimate relationship, is largely between Alexander and Natalia - his childhood after torturing the inner world, his generous and courageous understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both. Marilyn Gorys of the Antonia Line (Best Foreign Language Film Award from the Netherlands in 1996) gave us a calm film - not without disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, family struggles, love and respect. The foreground theme is the game of mathematical reason and logic of chess. Underneath it can be a mild tearjerker of drama set in late 1920. Cinematography captures the tranquil beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the soundtrack if you do not want to go to the cinema. The film "The Luzhin Defense" by Alexandre Desplat is complete.
