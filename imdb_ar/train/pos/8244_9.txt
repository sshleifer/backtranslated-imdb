loved it! What do not you like? - I got your swimmers, got a zombie, got your family problems, got your social dilemmas, and got one of the meat-eating retro-1950 style steak that was held at Bay By An Uneasy Worried about whether the next meal was the top crust. You can not order more. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss is absolutely perfect as a social climbing housewife. It's both brutal and criminal conspiracy. Every colleague's dream. K'sun is really wonderful because the Son just tries to be as natural as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeds. It's a real screen. Very light, natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the actors are wonderful. Henry Cherney plays the role of a suspicious police officer with sharpening instincts and little intensity as if he were his daily character. Billy Connolly is as delightful as Fido. Good actor: I hope he has starred in "Braveheart" directed by Gibson. My sense is that William Wallace was going to be closer to the real character. His fido is contained and can be accessed yet. Nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a wonderful comic irony of ethics, values, social visions, feelings, growth, adaptation at uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible circumstances. Show reality.
