A delightful little movie, short musical based on three songs of Cool Porter Broadway. The first pop-hop movie is a joy! He plays the American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at an outside cafe table telling his friends about this self-deprecating beauty. Suddenly he found her a few yards away. He ended up being annoyed by his friends and suggested, "Just show her your bank book." But Hope claims he can win it in less than 30 days with "no" money! They are betting on polo on the issue and taking all his money and identities. Followed by hope and when they alone promise to propose, she does not think he is sincere until he sings to her, "You are doing something to me" by Cole Porter. But she must leave and try to make money as a guide so he can follow her. But when she sees another girl appear around town, she is disappointed that she wants to drop it. Continues to chase her and his family and her family in a race track where he bet on his meager profits in the last race in the hope of winning enough to convince her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers, the winner loses his ticket and decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, race and bet and sing two more songs!
