Insomnia nightmare is the story of a man drowning in insanity. After chronic insomnia, Jack suffers from hallucinations. Making it try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We discovered interesting things about Jack near the end and believe that by the time the film ends we will have "luckily ever after" the Hollywood end. Error. This is New York City, the place where no one sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (writer and director) has made a good film in "The Insomnia Nightmare". A film director and filmmaker (she made this film immediately after graduating from high school), has real potential and will be the one to watch in the near future. <br /> <br /> While I was watching this short movie I was constantly uncomfortable; between music, dark scenes, and realistic portrayal of insomnia by Dominic Monaghan (Jack), I wanted to stop this at times just to escape it.
