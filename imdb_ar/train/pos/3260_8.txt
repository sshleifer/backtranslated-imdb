People call this comedy, but when I just saw it, I just laughed once. I think the problem is that I first saw her when I was 14, and I was not big enough to understand that I was not meant to be serious. There were some scenes that were supposed to be funny <br /> <br />, but I was very interested in the characters I was laughing at. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will find that despite some ridiculous flaws <br /> <br />, it is one of the most exciting love stories I have ever seen.
