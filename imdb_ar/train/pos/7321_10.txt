Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is well made and contains more psychological elements than you may realize at first sight. It's a simple film that tells me well. Music is perfect and one of the most poignant points ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you should check it out. The cast are all fantastic. I wish they had not made a sequel after the sequel. The first one was by far the best, and it should have ended as it did without the sequel. It was interesting to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the film. You did not progress in age (it's great today, without the hairstyle and the 70's). The viewer through the mask is one of the coolest things ever!
