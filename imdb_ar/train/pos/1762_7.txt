Well, here's the deal: If you feel offended easily you might want to stay away from the deal. There are some painful moments in the movie, but I'm probably ashamed of laughing. In fact, I may have been more ashamed than I laughed. And if you're not literally idiot from the outside, then you're red from the inside. If there is nothing in this movie that embarrasses you, then you simply do not feel shame. Whether this badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed a little, but this is a film I can not simply make a comprehensive recommendation because of its theme. If you say, "this hilarious movie, go check it out!" Some gentle old ladies going to the church go to the theater and suffer a heart attack during a clearly explicit sexual attitude, something I do not need in my conscience. <br /> <br /> How wicked is he? Well, try about 100 times worse than a wedding wedding. Quite frankly. My mother was out during the first scene. I feel it is my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There's some smart comedy here, but that's what I expect from the man (Good Abbato) who had both the hand of both freaks and obsessions and undeclared. I'm all mocking Michael McDonald. The only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a chance to get the money. "If you hear, Mo, be there again, I'll burn this place," Paul Rod said. "It's fun, but it's one of those things that most of the public will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> When we see a quick 3 seconds of Steve Carell singing with Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for two minutes after the joke ended, while most everyone laughed and then forgot. <br /> <br /> It is strange that there is an impressive moral story, despite the ferocity. The film does not portray Karel as a terrible loser just because he is a virgin. He has really been portrayed as an admirable figure. Sure, it's a bit weird. After all, he has a framed poster in Asia, "Video Games More Than An Asian Child" and a group of games with a million men, but we never believed that there was something wrong with the fact that he was a virgin. Although it sounds odd, there is a bit of a "wait in wait" message. <br /> <br /> But man, man, please warn you that this increases the search rating of "R" as much as possible. . This was definitely the intention of Apatow. According to him, he has left some players (especially Rogen and Malco) getting better and talking the way they usually talk, all trying to find a lot of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle it or talk that way yourself, you'll love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of bad words and excessive sexual jokes. I find that hidden and wonderful humor is more enjoyable than about 200 used for f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. As I said, there are some hysterical moments right here, but you have to ask yourself if you deserve to sit in one of the most vulgar movies you are likely to see in the theater. I do not know how much most women are interested in what men discuss when playing poker. Ladies sincerely, you may not want to know. If you're ever curious why some girls think men are good people, that gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> There you go - my humble and honest friend about what to expect. Be this your guide. Certainly, it should not be seen with the Sunday School, Mama, Grandma, any family member of the opposite sex, children of any age, or any person easily insulted by excessive profanity or explicit sexual discussion. If you see it with any of the above, you do not seem to have any idea what it means to be uncomfortable.
