A wonderful drama with all the areas covered except for a very slow-moving style that was supposed to show more relevant scenes such as a house character in an interview with the president, or a house killing rather than simply labeling us. Scenes like those would have kept the audience awake. Cutting off some useless minutes could have provided room for more hearty scenes like those. I kept pulling the film on this grandeur ever though seeing a house here makes the movie worth watching. As the big fans of the early festivals will 20th century styles and Montana like this really well ........
