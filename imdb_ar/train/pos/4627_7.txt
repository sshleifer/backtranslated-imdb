If you are going to play a play inside prison walls, why not go to the playwright William Shakespeare? If you choose your cast from a full range of criminals who spend long periods in the ugliest crimes, you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. In Kentucky Correctional Prison, such a courageous project was carried out with spectacular results. This film shows how everything was done. Representation? Prostrations ?? Fashion Group ?? And the final screening of Shakespeare's The Tempest. This has not happened to me before, but there is a similarity between the place of play and the reform prison. In the play, the wrecked characters are confined to the ship on an island that has no contact with the outside world. Life in prisons is also this way. <br /> <br /> With a slight drop in the surrounding oceanography, characters may not be in a group of the most pleasing fashion to stand out in front of an acceptable audience, Shakespeare was perfectly intent but with a genuinely sincere heart and sincerity. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the play itself was the appearance of every man behind his character. A playwright saw a lesson in remission for another as a return to his sins. It was very interesting to see men wiping their tears as they talked about killing, shooting and strangling. One had the feeling that they wanted to go back around the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone said) the past was past and present the beginning of a new future. At least, the play gave a temporary respite from the sad thoughts of past events. <br /> <br /> Prison authorities must be commended for allowing the play to be performed. Such an event would put KFC on the map and hope that other prisons will follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone will benefit, not only in Kentucky prison, but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self-esteem and prepare for the day they leave parole.
