Japanese internet movies did not do much for me, but among the few films I've seen, most of them were visually pleasing, at least entertaining. The game MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a type of parasite that takes two human hosts and controls their bodies and turns them into "attackers" and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently a "game" to enjoy the parasites mentioned . The film mainly revolves around a shy and empty person falling to each other, but their relationship to love is shortened because they are infected with parasites and are forced to fight each other. Becomes a test of human will versus parasite control over their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will be compared permanently with TETSUO (as in most bad internet movies), and for good reason. There are certainly some substantive similarities, although the films are certainly different. There's a lot of fun and nice moments at the MEATBALL MACHINE, and the creature / borg FX is definitely a high point - a mix of TETSUO-Meet-GWAR featuring detail and creativity. Depending on your taste in these types of movies, it may or may not be a MEATBALL MACHINE that you prefer. If you enjoy Cyber ​​Punk movies with a healthy dose of spots - this is for you ... 7/10
