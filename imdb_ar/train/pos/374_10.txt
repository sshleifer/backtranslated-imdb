Rated "10/10" master piece <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg's comment that he would re-show the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this film - along with Schindler's list - is your best. So Opera works well in this one! <br /> <br /> What happened to me most was the reality of the story and the drama. Things like this have happened and are still happening in the world.
