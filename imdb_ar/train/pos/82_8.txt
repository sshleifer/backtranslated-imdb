Fortunately for us fans of Real McCoy (probably all Baby Boomers who grew up in the late fifties and sixties of the last century), three actors / adult actress appeared when they participated in the reunion show in 2000. Both Tony Martinez and Richard Krina shortly thereafter. As much as he was pleased with the vision of Luke, Shogar Bape and Peppino together again, he was also obscure about the total absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I understand that Little Luke has died in 1999, but I'm not sure about that. No information about Hassie online, I can find it. So strange why not even mentioned? It was very clear that they were absent from the Reunion program, so much so that I think that the Michael and Lydia family themselves (if they are still alive) either (1) asked to be excluded from the discussion and thus their wish was granted, or 2) TNN could not find any An effect for Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seem to have disappeared. Therefore, the safest policy is to neglect them out of conversation together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, past events in Walter Brennen have been reviewed. They did not do anything about it ... It was the grandfather who made the show achieve this success. I remember, when I was a kid, simulating the simulated monkeys and laughter of my parents (and I'm sure a million other kids had done at the time). One annoyance that annoyed me a little, was the tendency of Richard Crane to dominate the debate ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to provoke a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed quite capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to be frank and talk a lot during Reunion's show. Regrettably, because I wanted to hear from the three, equally. All in all, Reunion was a real treat for me. I have watched it on DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
