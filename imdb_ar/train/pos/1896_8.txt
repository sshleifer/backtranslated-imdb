Arthur was always a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked in the film as an extra and to help horses during the stable scene that recently died. If you look quickly, you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while both Dudley Moore and Gil Ekinbury are in conversation. Frank was an equestrian hero and would miss all who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I knew the true life of Arthur Bach. He was not as rich as Arthur, but he spent 47 years of his life as a child. His parents had tight grips on the strings of his wallet, but the rent and utilities had been paid in an apartment in the basement of Greenwich Village. He spent much of his time getting drunk himself on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just as Doley Moore does. <br /> <br /> Arthur's wonder is why anyone bothers him with no wealth. But that is the other half of the equation. My friend was a charming person when I met him. In fact, it was just a compulsion to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to prove a degree of relationship with the seller. He spent his life as a perfect party guest. The term "waste", commonly used in the 19th century, applies. <br /> <br /> This is what Dudley Moore represents, a waste. Unlike my friend Moore, John Gilgod had to clean up after him. This is a full time job as we see in Arthur. My friend also did not find Lisa Menelli, Lisa Minelli in fact because he was an exception. Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is still a fatal and very real picture for me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, a century of the twentieth century, is forced to marry another child in a trust fund in the Aikenberry Generation. Since he will not work for a living, his threat to him is real. He has only Johns Hopkins, who plays John Gilgod, and Ted Pitt's manager Peterman, who is having trouble with him. We must all face these problems. <br /> <br /> In his nearly 100-year-old life John Gilgod has certainly done a better job than Arthur, and in fact Gilgod is well known for his performance. However, 1981 was a year of passion at the time of Oscar. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn the Oscars for the Golden Bond Award and Gilgod for Best Supporting Actor mainly for lifelong work. This man was amazing, and still in his profession almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So, for Frank Graham who worked in the film and Jackie Weiss, a real life for Arthur, I dedicate this review.
