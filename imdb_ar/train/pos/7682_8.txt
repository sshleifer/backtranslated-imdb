Holly addresses the worldwide sexual exploitation of children (about 2 million children trafficked each year) and do so sensitively and without manipulation - a long-term arrangement by the Priority Films team with great success. American actor Ron Livington starred in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen, the Vietnamese actress who plays the role of Holly, and bring together what is common to people in Cambodia's famous Redlight K11. Although it deals with a heavy subject, the film captures moments of laughter and hope when we get to know the characters closely, making the two-hour film away from being a difficult film to watch. I am happy that such a film draws the attention of the world to the problem. Child prostitution should be stopped and this is a very good first step. It is a wonderful film that everyone should see.
