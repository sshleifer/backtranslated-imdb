Let's think about people, quit the original, because it is time Battlestar series original masterpiece, even with all the stars and lines of story and art. Lorraine Green was wonderful where Adama and Richard Hatch were ideal because Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny like Starbucks, but I dare say, not as beautiful as Kate Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good and John Calicos was great like Baltar, and War of the Gods, and the best experience was in Terra, I thought it was a tribute to the way the sky could wait, Then you had women from Battlestar, not to compare them to suppose that Tricia was wonderfully beautiful as sixth, but the beauty of Jane Seymour could not be compared to him. Not to mention that Loretta Spang was a great caesopia. He had the beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassing. I liked the original just like new. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos has the number six? :) Thanks for listening.
