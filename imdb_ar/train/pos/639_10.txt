It is a good family show with a wonderful selection of actors. It's a nice break from the anger show the truth lately. There is nothing else like that on TV right now, unless you consider Joan of Arcadia similar because he enjoys a leading teen personality as well. Anyway, Clubhouse deserves a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of amiable and na√Øve attractive without being too sweet and lovable. Dean Kayne, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Winningham and Kersten Sturms roam the rest of the main acting team, all of whom are wonderful in their role. I really love Kirsten Storms as a Betsey house. It's the pill, but she still cares about her mother and her brother, even though she hates showing it. It may take some loops to find her legs really, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best offers in a long time, so check it out - you'll be glad you did!
