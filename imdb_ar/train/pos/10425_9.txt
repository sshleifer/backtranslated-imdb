The Caruso was the world's biggest success in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in 2005, when most of the "providers" were home watching their new Motorola TV. The figures are wrong --- because they fail to control inflation, and today's $ 10 films are likely to dominate. In 1951, the cost was between $ 90 and $ 1.60 at Radio City; 44 to 75 seconds at Loew's Palace in Washington DC , Or between 35 to 50 Centra in neighboring films. What matters is the number of people responding to the picture, not the undamaged box office. "The great genius of Caruso revolves around the fact that the directors spent most of their real life Enrico Caruso (in fact not a wonderful story anyway) Instead, 90% of the film's focus was on music, and so MGM gave us the best live opera singer MARIO LANZA to perform the best music of the historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO, and the result was a very bad film that was too bad for Lanza to cast his life and career away from over-eating Edmond Bordum played a very big place in the movie The Student Prince, If you want to see the great CARUSO, it's often on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not delay the low price, because it reflects only the ease of availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
