"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-behaved story about misappropriation steals (yells! - very low-grade word for the Fool, according to Peter Ostinov's main character) "Hot Million" of the London branch of an American company by creating Shell companies on the continent and using your own computer In a company that is presumed to be safe to transfer money to. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy and not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> From 1968, filming this computer may seem na√Øve to today's more computer-savvy people, but as someone who has worked with computers before In this film, I would like to emphasize that until then, these harsh blows were written by the mother of the computer, and perhaps intentionally to increase the comedic aspects of this British voice. <br /> <br /> If you have a little taste for this type of entertainment, it may seem that the movie is pulling in positions. Fortunately, the end has wrapped well. Unfortunately, the end credits do not give any reference to the classical music used - the symphonic piece at the end and the flute pianist in the middle - just a song Lulu sang and I can not quite remember.
