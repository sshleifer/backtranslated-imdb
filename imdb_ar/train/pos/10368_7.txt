Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing talent in accents and shows an amazing skill in this film in general. I really felt it when Lindy was persecuted. I also played realistically. I felt upset, angry and upset as the media and the government continued their relentless pursuit. I did not expect much from the film at first, but I'm really interested in it, and the film is based on real people and real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neil was also wonderful; this is the best work I've ever seen of him, and I've really liked him in other films (like the piano). I gave the film 7, but if I could rate acting, I would give it 9.5, and 10 is perfect for Streep.
