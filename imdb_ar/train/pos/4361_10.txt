Perhaps this was one of the most well-made films of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the height of her style. Photography by Sol Polito can be said to be his best achievement - brilliant works and lighting with subtle shading. Max Steiner contributes to one of his most complex and beautiful marks - an example of his classical classical style. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the scheme and is wonderful and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made the film continued to produce "Now, Voyager" later that year - a fabulous film that won awards and awards and was a historic favorite, badly because it starred in the House of Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film - made in all sections, more interesting, complex and fun. An unusual film entertains those who take it for its own sake, instead of highlighting their modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of critical perfection. Everything must be judged in its temporal reference and what it tries to achieve in accordance with its terms. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are very childish and completely miss this point. If you are hungry to get a perfect fillet paper, do not go to the bakery office and start to grumble and complain about the pastry pie. The art of cinematic criticism is really missing a large segment of the population. Sorry people - maybe if this movie has earned a degree from the Rolling Stones and hundreds of complex subtleties and soul searching, you are all happy. I will take an old film without modern intellectual excuses on a weekday!
