Out of movies for rent, picked up Freebird. I struggled through the first third of the film wondering if the rest would be a waste of time. Luckily, I really prepared this, and I loved the film a lot. The second half of the film was smiling and laughing all the time. Fortunately, although there are parts of the CGI included, they were not exaggerated or scattered. <br /> <br /> I would like to say, though - all the actors have heavy European dialects, so be warned that if you are having trouble understanding these voices or cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, and I would have to ask myself a copy of my own collection.
