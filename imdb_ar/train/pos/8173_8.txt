The brilliance of this film is that even a competent dentist is very scary. It is one of the primitive human fears. This film is a nightmare image that every child must pass through in the waiting room. Corbin Berenson offers a surprisingly sudden performance as a crazy dentist. I think he's trying to kill people but he's only working on their teeth, so that does not work. In a particularly horrifying scene, actor Earl Bowen destroys his teeth completely with training, etc., which I think is the absolute worst you can do when you are a killer dentist. It's Brian's usual budget, and it's not very well written but there's a lot. The plot is poor and at times it seems to be composed immediately, but hey, it's a killer dentist film, we've all thought of it but they did it first.
