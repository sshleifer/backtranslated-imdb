Really, I think this film is an example of an easier target than a really bad film. In fact, the film performs very well in many ways and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit complicated, but that's the type. The film has a juicy atmosphere centered around femme fatale. Just like all old classical music, this also contains a script that speaks you around so you do not always know how to understand it at first, and it can be an extension if you think deeply and try to put all the pieces together. This is the kind. In general, the script contains a number of surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing, and in turn, surprised, without giving up the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks fantastic and talks about her frantic, double-entry dialogue in a way that makes him seem mysterious, exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> The trend is more than acceptable, because we are facing - you need to keep an audience interested in "Is it or not?" The question is for two hours. In addition to the twisting text and pleasant performance of Stone, this is done effectively by creating a noisy atmosphere that is both dark and very strong and modern at the same time, with straight vertical lines that correspond to Stone's curves. The frame is always beautiful - temporarily press anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye. <br /> <br /> The film also effectively depends on the things that were tricky in the first film and turns it into something a little more realistic, especially sex. "Katherine Tremel is a hermaphrodite ... how horrible!" It actually becomes more important here, and usually, the sex life of the film is used to improve the effect. This is still painful, but it did not happen easily in order to get the value of shock and sizzling as it did in the first. I'm not going to say that it's still a fairly gimmick, let's face it, it's supposed to be a fun movie. <br /> <br /> A fun movie. This may be an easy goal, but if you see it for what it is: a disgusting, seductive, and sexy person who does not or does not, you must enjoy it (not pun intended).
