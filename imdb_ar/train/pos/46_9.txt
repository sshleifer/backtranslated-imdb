I just finished watching this movie for the seventh or eighth time, and I picked it up on one of the nights I saw in Blockbuster and loved it completely, I've shown it to 4 people so far and enjoyed it too. Avoid all the Hollywood charm, special effects and pressure on the "Shock Factor", this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on his head in dealing with the effects that occur after the painful positions. After a high school shooting, Alicia (busy Phillips) and Diana (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely association. Alicia, the stone-faced girl who has a pessimistic attitude towards life, helps Diana overcome life, death and living in the aftermath. At the same time, Dina is trying to help Alicia see some softness and light in the world again. Not focusing on the shocking event of photography, but on personal relationships between those who survived the film, distinguishes this film. Despite his short filming and short budget, this film is far from being cowardly. Ryan pays homage to a position he has never endured and tries to delve into the psyche of man. With the amazing and forthcoming actress, Phillips, adds drama to the dialogue and general feeling of the film, and helps Christensen balance the "oppressed and gloomy" feeling of the film. In general, I recommend this film, and if you enjoy the subject of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also suggest the 2004 documentary "It's a World of Girls", which deals with social bullying, compared to two girls in Montreal , Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Down Mary Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl, killed herself after being subjected to brutal intimidation.
