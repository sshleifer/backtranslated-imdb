What a wonderful British film, good laughs and Gary Stretch too, and Oh, lots of bikes and beautiful Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Members of our club ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club show things! Shouting !! <br /> <br /> There are some funny bits, good acting, good idea. <br /> <br /> The director, John Evey, is shown at a show in Warham, Dorset. Great man, to earth and good laugh. You must support this movie, as all Brit movies must be brilliant! <br /> <br /> So please go and watch it if possible, and have a web site with the cinemas you're viewing, so look for one near you! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get a DVD. Some cyclists' friends have already seen the movie two or three times and can not get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
