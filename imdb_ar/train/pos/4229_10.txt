Do not waste time reading my assessment. Take off and watch this amazingly good episode, which is probably Colombo's best book ever! Ruth Gordon was portrayed as a charming mystery writer who kills her son-in-law to avenge her daughter's murder. Colombo is his usual, turbulent and smarter character than he seems to be, and this distinctive batch is characterized by a wonderful chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Paradoxically, this was not written by the creators inherited from Levinson or Link, which is probably the most densely-crafted and most sophisticated plots in Colombo at all. Is quite satisfying in almost every department and engulfed in dialogue and ingenious thinking. The peak is unexpected and truly innovative all. 10/10 ... Look for this on Netflix!
