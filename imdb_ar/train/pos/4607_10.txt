My favorite movie Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by the 1985 film "Police Story". Chan plays a Hong Kong policeman who breaks the infamous crime master and his gang, and is then appointed to protect the man's friend (Brigitte Lin) so she can turn state evidence. As the story continues, the gangs sends fools to send Lynn, but Chan takes things in his hand and feet, keeping his girlfriend Maggie Cheung in a bind. Like "Drunken Master," "Police Story" contains many of the exciting stunts, martial arts and excitement of Chan, culminating in a royal battle in a busy mall. In his role as director, Chan excels in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that highlights the action. While the overall humor of the "Drunken Master" is highlighted, "Police Police" is essentially a detective story, a cop copious story to be copied over the years to come. <br /> <br /> 10/10
