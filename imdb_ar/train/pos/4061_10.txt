This is the best Disney has heard, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever in soundtracks, themes, characters and dialogues in the Kiki delivery service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This person has the hero and the heroine (although I do not really support the use of hero and heroine here, since Miyazaki goes beyond the stereotype and common theme). As usual, having been thrown away by Spirited, surprised by Mononoke, disturbed by the Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this thing begins with something on my side. I wonder if this will be my first metaphysical. Well, in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 ratings. I will give 9.8 ratings, but there are an additional 0.2 to share good feeling by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER One way or another I see this as a sad film, people die in this movie, the only robot, the deserted place, ends with destruction. It seems as if humanity can not live with too much power. The scene gave me a splash of spots from Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. The plot is evident in most of the reviews and the rules of soundtrack also (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno and Williams calibre. People who can bring a movie, game or event to life, so that they are moments that remain amazingly written. <br /> <br /> This is a good sense of film that was part of American cinema in the classical days (it's a wonderful life ... etc). Well, things change ....
