This is the first Tom Hanks movie I got the honor of seeing at the theater, although it's my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a killer role, I was thinking a little stunned, "Can Mr. Hanks pull that bet?" And he did in a high way. The 1930's Depression era is a loyalty, a salvation and a path you do not want your children to stumble upon. Tom Hanks leads the cast Michael Sullivan. Being a family man, the secret life of the murderous decade of Oscar nominated Paul Newman. Tom Hanks relies more on reaction and outlook rather than dialogue, which offers a knockout. <br /> <br /> One night of his career, Michael Ben Junior, played by newcomer Tyler Huecklin, witnesses the blow. And Michael's father's partner in the crime, fellow theater actor Daniel Craig can not get this information. So he moves away from the son and husband of Michael the Father, except for Michael the Son. So the two went to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Ronny Paul Newman). <br /> <br /> The drama and the intense plot really thicken from their father trying to set things right, although the son is along for the ride. While on this deadly journey, someone hired Michael Real. The killer will be the cameraman of the deceased Harlin Maguire, played by the stinking Jude. <br /> <br /> The movie will be worried for a long time. With Thomas Newman's Oscar-winning beautiful and controversial title, you can only appreciate this film from Oscar-winning director Sam Mendez. So relax and enjoy the wild trip.
