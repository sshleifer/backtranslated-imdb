This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is definitely beautiful and watchable. It is oriented in an old way and this is good. Sibyl Shepard as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome her husband's death. It has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much to Ryan O'Neill as a Philip, because, at best, indescribable. It may be appropriate in this role, but this is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I feel that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written enough in-depth thinking. We do not know anything else about them because minutes after the story becomes thick, the writers do not tell us beyond what is happening. But this problem has been solved because Mary Stewart Masterson has a fresh sweetness and a daisy to narrow it, and Robert Downey Jr. is so enchanting that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. His dreamy eyes are ideal for deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy, and if you love them that way, why not try them. <br /> <br />
