This independent film looks at the lives of a group of people who take part in the swimming pool for adults in Connecticut. The plot is rather thin. What moves the film is the characters, played excellently by mostly unknown actors. The Brewster site occupies a prominent position in a high school suffering from marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer highlights the moon as the actress's two evildoers give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive first feature film by writer Shichter and director Seton. The latter keeps the narration moving in a fast clip. The title of the movie and the poster suggests something, but this is a wonderful little comedy drama.
