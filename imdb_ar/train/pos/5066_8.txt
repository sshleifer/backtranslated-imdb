I know some people think the film is boring but I disagree. It is a very complex and unusual personal biography. I liked the characters in the film and I think leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery has captured his humanity. I do not think the purpose of a good CV is to detail a person's life, but the complexities and relationships that make him interesting. What is more wonderful than someone successfully reinventing themselves? "Men become what they dream about - I dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand has really come to me as an attractive actor and I hope to see him in more films.
