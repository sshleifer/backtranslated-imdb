I saw it for the first time in the early nineties on UK TV, I liked it then but I missed the chance to record it, many years passed but the movie was always stuck with me and I lost hope of seeing it again, the main thing was that sticking with me is the end, The hole is really, easy to see, has a wonderful story, great music, and the list goes on and on, well, I say how good it is, but everyone will take it there best away from them as soon as they see them, yes first class animations and beautiful to watch them Very few but it became so Part of the beauty, I'm very happy because it came out on DVD because it is one of the 10 best movies of all time. Buy it or rent it just to see it, and best offer at night alone with drinks and food so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
