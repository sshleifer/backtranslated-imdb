This was a gem. The stunning representation of performances by Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting actors. The film raises a topic that concerns not only Irish and Irish history but also many communities around the world and many marriage units within these communities. The film shows intensely and faithfully how religious beliefs and traditions have pushed wedge into a loving and emotional family. The title "Love Divider" can not be captured better. Although it was a true story that took place in Ireland in the 1950s, it saw how the whole village life began and the "massacres" reminded me of the history of Russia. Intolerance and prejudices are still very strong in the world, and unfortunately they are hidden deep within human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character says: "Hatred always existed under the surface." It was interesting to see the moral choices people make in this story. Also the personality of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story were meaningful. But the story gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and that love makes us better and stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the entire transformation process in the context of the story to become a man he always wanted. Acting again is first class. The story is fast-paced. The Irish countryside is as beautiful as it has always been. Highly recommended.
