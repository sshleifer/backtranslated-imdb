I went to this movie and I expect a scary Artsey movie. What I got was fear after fear. It is a horror film in essence. It is not as boring as other horror movies where there is a house inhabited by ghosts and ghosts. This film does not show you even the majority of deaths but rather shows the fear of characters. I think one of the best things about the concept is not just where the house is chasing from going home. They became haunted no matter where they were. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. After reading some of the external reviews, I was really surprised that the critics did not like this film. I'll see him again this week and I'm excited about him. <br /> <br /> This movie was given 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should do. She scared me.
