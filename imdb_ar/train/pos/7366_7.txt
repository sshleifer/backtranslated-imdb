It's a movie that the main market will never be able to access because it does not give viewers easy viewing. The story about troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie but has its own unique feature and found it amusing. There are moments of brilliance given that the film was filmed on such a low budget, such as when inhaled spike aerosols. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton, and to be honest, he made me spend most of the film trying to find a solution. I also did not like the fact that most of the movie is spent with two friends talking and not really much. It is a small complex film to watch and that makes it attractive.
