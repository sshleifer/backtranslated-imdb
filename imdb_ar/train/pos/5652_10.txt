I love this series! Many stereotypes portraying southerners as Hicks are very obvious, but such people are frequently present. The depiction of the Government of the South symbolizes the truth as well, but sympathetic figures recall one of the many good things about the South as well. Some things never change, we see "good adult boys" every day! There is Lucas Pack in every southern town, he just has to make a phone call to make things happen, and the "po 'white trash" is very familiar. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else can happen very well in the modern South! I think somehow Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
