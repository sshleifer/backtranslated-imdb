I admit I am a vampire addict: I have seen a lot of vampire movies I have lost their number, this is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed by the original vampires John Carpenter, and when I came down there was a supplement I went straight and bought. This film does not obey the same rules as the first one. It is not completely dark, but it is close enough and feels well built on the original. Jon Bon Jovi was as good as Derek Bliss: his performance was popular but difficult enough for the viewer to think he might be able to stay in the world he lives in. It was one of my favorite parts after Zoe's interview and strolling in the dinner bath to see if she was more than she looked. His comments are beautiful and impressive, but they are a very fine process that contrasts well with the rest of the scene with its evolution. <br /> <br /> The other cast members were well chosen, and they were well liked to produce an entertaining and original movie. It is not just a rewording of the first film and has grown in much the same way as Fright Night II from Fright Night. There are different elements that make it a new film with a similar feature. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I recommend this movie. If you prefer your films less bloody, choose something else.
