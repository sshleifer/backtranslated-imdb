I saw this movie when I was a little girl. I enjoyed it every time. The graphics are certainly a little cheesy, compared to the present time, but in the seventies they were fantastic. I saw it in the original Spanish version only and I think it was fantastic. So I remember Christmas with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and could not wait to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, look for this old version of Santa Claus. It's a different version of what we're used to today, but who says there's only one way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. He teaches children good versus bad. I do not know how the translated version is in English or whether there is an English version, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and happy holiday! Feliz Navidad!
