"Good times," in my opinion, is hit CBS must watch it! Despite the fact that I have not seen each episode before, I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite. Also, I really liked the theme song. If you ask me, although I love everyone, it was great to have everyone stayed in the program throughout his entire career. Everyone was always doing well, the production design was amazing, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TV Land now, I strongly recommend taking it if it stops working well.
