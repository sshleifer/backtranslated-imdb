In 1990, Disney's television cartoonist was in the making. Deals like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already famous, and now Disney has made another great cartoon and this cartoon came to the birth of Disney in the afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It is about the Jungle Book character of Baloo the Bear and he gets a job in aviation. In this series, Kate Clucker, ex-Air Pirates and Server Good Surfer, meets businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham and her daughter Molly's hyperactive. This series is very funny and has tons of wonderful puns that you may not understand as a child but understand later in life. This is a cleverly written series and it is nice to add them to your DVD set. Parents, buy this for your kids instead of letting them watch all those deadly cartoons of Nickelodeon. If you like TaleSpin, then check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
