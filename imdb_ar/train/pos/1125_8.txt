Michael Cakoyans was a relatively long walker but had a few amazing credits in his name, including some of the real failed characters such as The Day Came Out. Eviginia, however, is the highlight. Taken by Cacoyannis from the Euripides play, it is an excellent show of classic tragedy, and has recently appeared for the first time on television for many years in the United States thanks to Flix. The film was shot on an epic scale, but it is certainly not a "big" film, focusing on the simple story: At the invitation of the gods, King Agamemnon (Costas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Evgenia (Tatyana Babamushu) and much of Clytemnastrae (Irene Pappas). Casacos and Babas are both wonderful, but it is Babamushu who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the realization that she is a pawn in a political game. Highly recommended for international cinema lovers.
