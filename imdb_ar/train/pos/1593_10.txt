The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being younger has some teen problems on the other hand her sister Fall has a job, boy friend, and fiance problems like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, making mistakes sometimes, but they do not give in and continue. The exhibition is about friendship. Priorities in life. I love this show very much. It's funny and the actors are very good. I'm really sad because the show is over. I still watch redirects to time :) Amanda Pines is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays well. She is one of the actresses I love to watch. I love Vince and Holly's relationship, she is very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he shows up. With Tina Holly I found a real friend and I really love them hanging out. Loren's personality is very funny and is a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I hope the offer is not over yet.
