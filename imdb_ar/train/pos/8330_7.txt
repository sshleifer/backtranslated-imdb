What delightful delight? The film is highly efficient and has a lot of magic and good work that lacks a lot of romantic comedy films. Einstein acts brilliantly by Walter Matau, while Meg Ryan Katherine is memorable? Better than I saw in those films versus Tom Hanks? As a young mathematician struggling to recognize him. <br /> <br /> You do not need to be a young woman to understand Katherine's struggle and feel her sympathy immediately, and as a young man it is easy to understand what must have gone through Ed (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There is a universal appeal in these feelings, even if it keeps everything light, enjoyable and beautifully connected. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is not heavy, but if you look at some subsections. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spirituality; his words were like something, "If that is not impossible, why do you do it?" Suggests that he is a believer in achieving the highest goals of one's immediate understanding. In this film, there are questions about what the incident really is? Such as whether Albert's intervention and its misleading and ridiculous implications in inciting Catherine away from the harshly harsh lips, James (Stephen Fry) gives a cartoon character and can only feel it because of his lack of feeling. What is the amount of intervention that happens in our lives and which we do not see, coincidental coincidence? <br /> <br /> Of course, we would like to think about real life, despite what we often notice from people you know, that Edwards we get to Catherine and James must learn how to remove the ice in the veins. How nice it is to know that he might succeed in an innocent land (and its exclusively Caucasian effects) of the Eisenhower era dating back to the Age of Faith.
