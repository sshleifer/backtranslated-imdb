William Hurt may not be an American idol anymore, but he still enjoys a good taste in film projects. Here, he plays the role of a specialist in hazardous waste cleaning operations with a tragic past that tracks a long-term loser - the former boy Wheeler Gemayel - who was contaminated with deadly poison. Hardy Krueger Jr., the current handsome boy - perhaps more handsome than his father - appears as the arrogant Weiler president in a horrifying sequence in a chemical plant transporting the story. Natasha McClone is an eccentric government agent looking at an incident that offers an inevitable and high interest interest to Hero Hurt. Michael Brandon pops up to play a wonderful kind of prisoners who you can not wait. Coca-Cola won the 2000 Product Placement Award where soft drinks are served in all stages of production and are lovingly photographed on its site in a Hungarian winter postcard.
