The film focuses largely on bullying Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo fisherman and the people they have to bear. In the midst of the search for decreasing numbers of buffaloes, it marks the end of a tragic era of meaningless slaughter filled with drama and remorse for both buffalos and Native Americans. Taylor was blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivete that buffalo herds would never disappear. In one scene, an animal was shot after an animal, while in another scene the Indians were killed, then ate the food they cooked on fire. Under this harsh exterior, the insecure person turned to begging his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Ross Tamplin) not to leave him. It is not the most wonderful film and the drama that it creates, which leads to a very bleak and appropriate conclusion in a strong blizzard.
