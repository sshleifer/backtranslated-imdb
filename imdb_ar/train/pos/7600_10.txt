After I became totally addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would be another show about to be as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Missing is spelling! I love this show completely and I can not stop it. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. I am completely addicted to drugs. I do not know how creative people do, but every character touches me deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, up to my pictures !!! I do not have a cab, so I rented the series on Netflix. When I wear it, I watch all the episodes at once and I feel sad when it ends. I can not wait until the next disk arrives at my house. Maybe this is the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
