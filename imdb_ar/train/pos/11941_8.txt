They do not care about reporters Carrie Grant and Rosalind Russell from his "Friday Group," or smart detective William Powell and Ms. Myrna Lowe of Thean Mann, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are as amazingly enchanting as Scoop's fans. Their football partner is more postmodern than post-depression, filled with Allen's writing with sarcastic self-deprecation and old New York anxiety. Rare shades of old wit rarely occur, such as when the Great Splendini, like Sid, responds to his background: "I was born into Hebrew persuasion, but when I became older, I embraced narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen Match Point as a bad girl, here becomes a relatively good journalist and sometimes stuck in a murder mystery suitable for London: serial killer. This plot is a reworking of the recent stir-up of Match Point in London, to the sins of the upper class and the "American tragedy" / "The Place in the Sun" episode. In fact, Allen rephrases the murder mystery in Manhattan and Purple Rose in Cairo to name a few other examples. I do not care if he rephrases; I want the new material to be at least equal to the original assets, unfortunately it is just a reflection of his younger grandeur. <br /> <br /> As a director and actor, he will not be able to hide his love for the actress, because he could not achieve it with Diane Keaton, and thus take a modest comedy in a convenient place under the law of Allen, not wonderful but amusing, : About the suspected top class killer, Mr. (Allen) joked "I'd be very surprised if you killed one person." This is a vintage Allen humor. Although there are no bright literary cues like most of his films, Scoop loves music from Greg, Tchaikovsky and Straus to let us know that Woodman has not lost touch of his class.
