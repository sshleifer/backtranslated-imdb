I rented this a few years ago and had a VHS video shop only at the time. Directly to the video were the steps (as you know, where the lid covers the same line and color schemes successful films). I did not know what to expect other than what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching was "What's wrong with hell with sound?" - It is clear that there was no dubbing in the dialogue. I hesitated, so I stopped mating with all I had to draw your attention to the fact that there was no Shakespeare here! The story is simple enough, boy meets the girl and so on. What surprised me was strong and welcoming, the people in the film were not like the cartoon written in the story, but the actors who were temporarily removed from their real jobs (uniform) included. All the time, you begin to realize what the director is about, and then you see that there are no attempts at the spirit of cheap humor (people are hurting their privacy, using vulgarity that can not hurt marketing.) If they have a bigger budget, I'm sure they think about it every day, but they continued to realize it ... I felt that this was what the independent film industry was about.
