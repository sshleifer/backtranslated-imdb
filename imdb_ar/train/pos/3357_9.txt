While Rome feels mad to celebrate Hitler's visit - uniforms, bandits, marches - two remain outside at home, in a large building, ending with the meeting. She is Sofia Loren, the wife of a brutal public servant and a mother of six. He is a Mastroiani, a radio speaker who was separated because of his sexual abnormality. They both need a company and an understanding, and both find it in each other. <br /> <br /> The movie covers several hours. The color is pale and everything happens with the audio track of military rallies and hysterical radio broadcasters. The strange thing is that the Nazi anthem - Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, excellent entertainment for a special era in Italian history and an impressive and sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sophia Loren is doing a great job, far from her usual wife's characters in the Neapolitan truck driver. do not miss.
