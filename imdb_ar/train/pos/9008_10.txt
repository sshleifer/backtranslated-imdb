I saw this movie without knowing what it was ... I am a fan of Perang, even more of his films about Shakespeare, and at first, I only saw him for this ... I ended with tears in my eyes, because great serenity, greatness, and values ​​affect And courageous philosophy about the life of the Helena girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV shows (in Spain, at least).
