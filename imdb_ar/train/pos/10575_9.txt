Fast paced, funny, sexy, and stunning. Kani is always wonderful. Blondel charms you with her wit and energy. Obviously this pre-censorship film by the hint in the text, fashion, the way touching each other. And bikinis before there are bikinis! This is not a hedonistic pleasure for everyone. I do not understand the case of John Garfield though. Does it matter or not is it in this film? If so, the screen will be too short to be essentially a pillar. You need to watch it frame by frame until you find it if there is. I'm a big fan at Cagney, but I have never seen this before. I found Turner on classics. I found this by chance wonderful. Sit and enjoy the tour!
