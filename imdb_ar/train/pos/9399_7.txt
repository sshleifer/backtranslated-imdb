This is a film I saw when it first appeared and which I have seen several times over the years. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedies do not take sides: they distort the work and the capitalists on an equal footing. Master only seems outside the classic struggle, although he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning: Do not read more if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although it was presented reasonably. Ask yourself: Can someone support most of their weight in a single thread of cloth? Almost no support will be cut. <br /> <br /> Also, when the alley is jammed into an alley, Sid uses debris that can be covered like a knight's armor. Nice symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day, I will get this on a DVD.
