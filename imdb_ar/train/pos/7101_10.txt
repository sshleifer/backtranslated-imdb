Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least for me, is not so bad. In fact. I consider it a favorite film of all time. The welding of stories is not very well organized when you think about the differences between the series, but despite all this, you can watch it with great joy. For a feature film of his day, the viewer fits well and the characters are always believable. <br /> <br /> The audio / sound track is my favorite. Almost everything has a true sound effect and many voices fit the characters much better than their American counterparts, who are now thrown with great difficulty. The synchronization is perfect in every snapshot. I have encountered some problems in selecting "weird" sounds (please forgive the raw label, it's been a while since I've seen it). Otherwise, the staff seems to be perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this film. The subject of Dubs is rarely agreed with him long ago. I've loved the OSD ever since, but often have no castings on the series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that this was one of the first animations I have ever seen. It has a historical value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, I stayed stronger and more watchful in my group. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the title never came except in the United States in Texas. Personally I think it's a big shame. If the right audience were subject to that, I think Robotech would have accepted and will not be polluted over the years. I was involved with anime every day of my life, and everyone who showed this film thought it was a great title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components will allow the viewer to observe the obvious plot holes between the shows. However, without seeing the original copies, the viewer will not really notice. Because animations are identical in style, there is no reason to question them in their day. The UK was very limited access to the anime. Laser discs were the most productive medium. Personally I like the way Karl used the balls to drive at least that kind. I mean, Harmony would not have put the money in the series for publication. <br /> <br /> Despite the few flaws that are hard to satisfy in this film, the 1980s feel like it is in love. If you are watching the Megazone 23 now, on its original Japanese sound, or new dup, I think you will be completely disappointed with the OSD. Get your mind back to the original soundtrack of Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine the new 80's voice on E.V.E <br /> <br /> Say all this. The popularity of this film is now due to its scarcity in the open market. Personally, I was born a group for me. If I could meet Karl Mask, he shook hands with his hand to get the effort, and bought him a pint or a box to put in an anime.
