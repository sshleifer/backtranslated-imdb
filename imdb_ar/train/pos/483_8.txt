Very few chess movies have been produced over the past two years, but this is more than just a chess movie. It is a story about the need for love and the need to win it. John Tutoro plays a man who faces psychological challenges, and it does not matter. His acceptance of 64 boxes and 32 pieces, the game confirms him as a person, when losing a game loses the only logical thing for him and John Tortoro expresses it in a beautiful way, so that the love of the woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if Luzon is obsessed with the game, I'm sure they are, if you are a fan of chess it will not hurt to watch it. It's a smart piece of work that is properly developed and executed well, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt if there will be a sequel.
