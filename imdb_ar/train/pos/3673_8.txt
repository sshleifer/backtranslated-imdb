In 2004, I saw "True", the contribution of Tom Tykwer in Paris Je T'aime. When I saw him I loved him and became happy. My short film became my favorite and made me appreciate the format very much. Of course I wanted to watch the whole movie, and even check who was connected, and so on. Yesterday I finally saw him, with the permission of the Internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I have to say it looks awesome. The photography is beautiful in every short shot, and at worst there is nothing special - but still wonderful and clear. Later I read the trivia here, maybe it is how the scan gives 6K more justice for all DP works. My favorites are the first scene "Quais de Seine" and Sin City-esquire ("Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement") - but you know, what the hell that all of them are like: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" I am still worried about those wonderful colors (my eyes, tremble!) And "Quartier Latin" imprisoned in gold on silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some beautiful short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's access the content. I am very much (and I mean very much) like the selectivity that I felt very successfully. You never have the same features or treatment between two lines, and I think the formula is constrained enough to allow all these artists to explore beautiful things and deepen their pants. I liked to go from a simple love story to a crazy-Chinese-musician-in-Paris-with-Barbit-Schroeder to social commentary in a terrorist comedy in a humble monologue. I love the surprises! This film has them! It is great that they took the opportunity to portray all these directors as extraordinary things in mainstream cinema (which I deeply despised). It is not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space of these people. <br /> <br /> I love little time and love acting. I love simplicity and love. I like simple feelings, beauty and eclecticism, and in general, it's a very nice movie to see, alone or with someone. To feel simply. Let me feel very good. <br /> <br /> There's something serious about it ... It's very straightforward ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, for me there are two short films that are not quite the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good and polite, maybe even necessary, but very much like a commercial?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" Although I love acting, I felt that subjects were imposed. But of course, I just. "Tour Eiffel" I did not like too, but I think it's probably because of my sensitivity that is quite different from Sylvan Schumt's feeling? I do not know if this film is of particular interest to people who already know the actor and director, so they can be happy with their interaction, in the surprises (look for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and mainly in "What Will This Do With This?" A wonderful question I enjoyed Do it a lot this way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: most of the short films I loved and all together form a beautiful and lively mix. Definitely recommend it. definitely!!! So, watch it if you love eclectic nice love!
