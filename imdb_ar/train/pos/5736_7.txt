Domland focuses on the life of a family (American?) ... father; a violent and obscene person who likes to use jargon and uses abusive words and has no alternative qualities. Mother; who seems to be psychotic paranoid, does not really say much. The son; The animation is simple and raw, but it suits stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch.com site, but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on DVD Here is a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1- Neighbor: We meet next door, and discover three things about him ... He has a really nice barn, he has only one arm and likes to do evil things with Ducks. <br /> <br /> 2. Grinder: We discover that the wife has to do with exercise, but the husband does not really think it is a good idea. In the end, the exercise loop is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3. The doctor: The father was subjected to an unfortunate accident with a live wire exposed ... The doctor's examination is completely accurate (if not unconventional) but the diagnosis is "completely natural" (but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4. Visit a friend: After a fight with the new clothes crane, a friend comes to visit him (Believe it or not, he) has one! But after meeting him we can understand why), no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5. Get the Stick: We meet another neighbor, who has a stick stuck in his mouth (although we did not find out how he got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the mouth of his neighbor ends up being more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but he is victorious in the end ... Jesus may be some people are not grateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6. My teeth bleed: this was my favorite episode ... It was also the most frequent and disturbing (is that what he says about me?). I'm not sure why the son's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say it was too small for the story plot. It is a contradiction, because the story did not have any plot. But there was a funny ending (including a fly) !! Uncle Bob: After interviewing Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we have a clear sense that the gene pool in Dumbland is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sick colleague (I do not explain, lest I spoil you). Surely Uncle Bob's wife wears trousers in his family ... The father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her abundant fist (and spends the rest of his visit in an alley in a tree in the backyard). 8. Ant: After the house sneaks into the ants, the failed attempt to spray it ends ... and ends up splashing himself in the face with splashes of errors and starts hallucinating. Put the ants on a great song and dance performances ... go berserk in an attempt to kill them, and end up in full body plaster ... and just lets say, that the ants get their revenge in the end. <br /> <If these stories are bad, there's something I have to watch. They give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite managers. David Lynch. Maybe they were his outlet, to get rid of some of his violent ideas? I laughed loudly at many points within the rings. Many funny funny aspects !!
