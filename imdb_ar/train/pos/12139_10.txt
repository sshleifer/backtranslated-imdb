This film, although over 70 years old, remains a powerful and influential film. Bette Davis, such as Waitress Cockney, Sinister, Mildred, is completely believable. Watching her performance is still arrogant. She makes the viewer despise her and regret her at the same time. Leslie Howard's poor, obsessed Philip Carey is not strong, but I do not see how any representative can maintain his performance against Mrs. Davis's performance. She chews the scene in every scene she is in, and steals the show completely. This is the star-studded film that deserves the Oscars, but it's lost. It was shocking to have this day with unwanted pregnancy topics, multiple sex partners, and the evil language of Mildred, so it is fairly dated, but it is still an excellent film. Just to see the scene in which Mildred Philip tells what you really think ("You're almost, you dirty pigs ....") is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen in the film.
