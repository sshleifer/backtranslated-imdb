You know when you look at this film Brian de Palma today, I'm sure there has been a lot of criticism about its history. Also, about violence. When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20 years old, I thought it was very violent and brave as well. But I did not get it. "<br /> <br /> A few decades passed, man, how do I know how much I did not get in this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent film that was made in 30/40. But you are telling a story that is being updated with the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade of the 1980s, with "Palma," "Stone," and "The Gang," a good, ambitious and interesting film. > <br /> Yes .... Disco was dying and the New Wave / Punk was taking over but those immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida could not tell the difference. What they wanted but how to get them ??? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get them in Florida where they were ... By getting a lot of money and getting money, you had to take charge of the drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic for me as Tony Montana, "the little train that can be." What an amazing way to take a look at your leading personality in America: to fight, kill and steal. "He said. <br /> <br /> This is what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted to live in his circle and did not see embarrassment in the way he went to get it. Tony Montana's English leadership was heavily saturated with the word "f", but what did you expect, Emily Post's final school for him and his friends? See how they came to America, what they knew, and what they were exposed to. This is how Tony and his team chose to "be all they could be in America." It was all about power. Tony Montana was going to do something and do it to achieve it .. with all its violent, false, theft, twisted and robbery. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that embodied me in the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's crew brings bags of drug money to the bank. Did you care about Tony and his crew? In clubs where he spent and drank? Both. Money was money and money, you can get power. Tony was high off the pig. He and his blond American wife, who married Michelle Beaver, played well. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana came to power, he discovered there was real madness there. He is addicted to drugs, he is paranoid, surrounded by those who want to eat him in a bloody process, and his American drug addict's 80-year-old trophy he finds. His empire because ... he falls. And go down in a violent and appalling style, but again ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is the perfect Eighth movie that tells you a distorted story of how the American Dream is misunderstood ... an acquisition. It is violent, bloody, excessive ... but it leads the point to the home in a disturbing way. Not all Cubans expelled from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s, such as Tony Montana. Give me a break. But to show the misery of the 1980s by emphasizing greed and money as measures only in the United States "to be someone" has the power to take over these poor people and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> It makes you wonder - has anything been learned since then - today?
