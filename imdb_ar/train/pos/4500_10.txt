Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who travels to his home in Manchester to be near his father. Along the way, Anna, a 20-year-old woman, is the wife of his new boss Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of his new colleagues, Owen continues to get Anna for himself, to the point of sabotaging Anna and the marriage of Richard the Deceiver. This is a romantic drama with many humorous tones and quick acumen. The actors are wonderful: the green of Student Student and the Touch of Evil on smning smain on the screen as Owen is warm but heart; Annis of Dune is a lively fame and proves a good match with Green. The kitchen, from "Play The King" is the right threat represented by Richard, who misses his comic moves and discontent by building his hatred of Owen. It is an ideal triangle of love, and despite the weaknesses and omissions of our three characters, you have become better acquainted with them and watching them.
