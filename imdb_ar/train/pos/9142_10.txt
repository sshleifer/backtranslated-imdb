Purple Purple ... What can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all representatives were well chosen. The film was a wonderful story. loved it! Since I saw this movie, I was stuck in the 80s, and I am only 13 years old! My favorite part of the film was when his father died and he picked up all his musical compositions, and Apollonia was sitting on the stairs with his ear in her hand. Critics say it's a drama but I think it's more than a love story. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the film, he actually acted like him. I'm very happy because I saw this movie. Purple Rain, which she sang beautifully, was very hearty. I cried more than once.
