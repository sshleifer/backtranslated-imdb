Speaking of the opening of the explosion, "Infernal Trumpa" has the most impressive opening credits at all! Guided by musical tones perhaps inspired by the legendary idea "Friday 13th" (Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main players on the screen are divided into giant clips. A promising introduction from the mystical / mysterious rear survival film, becomes cooler with every passing minute. Two of the enemies of paintballs, who are highly competitive and carry testosterone, challenge each other in the final showdown in a flimsy bar. According to an article in a newspaper, there is a loose wild bear in the nearby woods and many fishermen who have tried to catch him have already been killed. The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will announce that he is a macho hero with the largest set of balls. Upon arrival, it becomes clear that they did not encounter Dibba but that war-obsessed warlords are completely obsessed and have an arsenal of weapons in their hideout and many combat scams. After ten years of American stiletto ladders and its taming of derivatives, this Mexican effort in the early 1990s seems to be very buoyant. The formula is simple but effective, and the leading figures are reasonable enough, and building towards confrontations with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspicious. The fanaticism must be Freddie Krueger and Michael Myers, because he also uses an informal glove with sharp knives attached to him and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are bad and barbaric, which I have really hoped for since the sequence of the above editorials, and waste a lot of unexplained blood. The development of forests, especially the traps of phishing, is amazingly joyous. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican Sleep / Survival blow that comes warmly recommended to lovers of this genre.
