After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere, and then came The Flock. There is a nice smile so far and you can get some facial gestures, but he has shown me that he finally got his craft and he can act with the best. Claire Dance was also an outstanding "trainee / substitute". Some suggested that there was a lot of unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I have seen detracts from the power of this film. I was really shocked because I did not hear about being released in theaters and shocked at the Blockbuster instead. Truly an exceptional film with the right mix of action, thrill, excitement and social awareness. As good as 7 even? Well maybe. And you'll see that he is acting better than Gere than anyone who came out of a house.
