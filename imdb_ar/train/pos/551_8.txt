In the fourth of five Westerners Anthony Mann with James Stewart, this one involves a stiff cattle bitten named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, across Seattle. He connects in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rob Morris (JC Fleben) who sent him ahead of schedule to prepare for the boat trip north. <br /> <br /> First of all, he must bear the hands of the insurgency, and he is fooled by the captains of the river boats and the charm of the manipulated castle of Ronda (Ruth Roman) who believes that Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hid him on the boat while the captain was looking for him earlier (and justified) to kill his hand. <br /> <br /> Jeff also has his misfortune to run to Judge Gannon (John McIntyre), who runs Skagway, Alaska. Gannon closes Jeff's suspension by suspending his audience by running his cattle across the town. He fines Jeff for owning his livestock and only Jeff to eat the crow at present. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Jeff agreed to take a point to Ronda and Dawson to supply supplies. But this is just a trick so Jeff, Ben and Rob can return to Skagway and steal his livestock. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out this is quite late, but Jeff is late with a gun while Ben races cattle over the Canadian border out of reach of Gannon. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting with some other Skagway men, they finally reached Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which happens only to Ronda, who then immediately set up a new Dawson gambling house. Then Jeff takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts collecting gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon comes to Dawson to participate in the golden event there, and tells Jeff he was a bit bored with Skagaway and wants to try his luck at Clondike, himself. This involves bringing some armed men with him and stealing some of the miners' claims forcibly. Jeff and Ben now feel that the time has come to give them up while things are good, leaving Rob to defend himself as an ineffective police chief against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They are looking for a way back only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made a mistake in opening his big mouth. Ben and Jeff were seriously wounded, but this does not save Judge Gannon from his right. Shoot at the end of the night in the muddy Dawson Street take care of so much. The first Jeff kills two of the best gunman Gannon (Jack Ilam and Robert Wilkie). Then when Rhonda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to sneak behind him, Gannon fires at her in the back and dies there in Jeff's hands. He then kills Jeff Gannon as he hides under a wooden platform. Revenge has spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another annoying west that is totally there with SPUR NAKED and the guy from LARAMIE. Why the DVD uses universal printing and scanning instead of the wide print that TCM uses, is something outside of me. The semi-cinematic Alberta glorious by William Daniels will end up missing. So if you love Westerners with well written 1950s, this is the list keeper. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
