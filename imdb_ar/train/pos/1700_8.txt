I love this movie and you have to respect the dwarfs dressed like little mars. Make sure that the story may be thin at times, but you can not get away from the way it was done. I used to see this again and again when I was eight years old. It's a children's movie, plus it has some of the best prices ever. The Blanche's "Home-on-Term" delivery is wonderful. Very good if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
