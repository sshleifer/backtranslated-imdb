Whether it's a good film or not, you should make movies of this kind. It reminds me of "I Love Hackabees", a very puzzling film with Isabelle Hubert sodomized by an American boy in a clay pond, in a sadistic sad way ("!!!!"). I hope that the director will continue to cross the border, as if I felt that the choices made by Vincenzo Natali were not always subtle (some scenes were a bit of disrespectful "tert-a-la-cream," like baby sheets). The color "Cube" was black, "Nothing" white, more joyfully, surprisingly, than the previous Natali movies.
