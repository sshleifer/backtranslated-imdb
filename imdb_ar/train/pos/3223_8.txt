Well, this film is basically a science fiction film, but it's obviously been cleverly directed. You can count about 10 cliches built by the film, but it is distributed only to three of them, and two of them have a twist that lets you know again that the director did not assume you were an idiot. Kurt Russell's representation is truly wonderful and brings a depth of amazing and rewarding character. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
