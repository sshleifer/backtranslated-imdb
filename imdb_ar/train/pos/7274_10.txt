No Strings Attached is one of the best Carlos Menesia deals to date. Forgotten is known for peddling and ridiculing ethnic issues. However, he does more in performing this stand, which happened in San Francisco. In general, Menesia does not only make you laugh, it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. <br /> <br /> In this long performance, Menesia talks about things like illegal immigration and what women really mean when they seek equality in the workplace, terrorism, his view of Gibson's propensity for Christ to Christ, his argument with a woman about whether Was influenced by Jesus or not, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally disabled. Minsia even discusses whether one should have the right to talk and tell a joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Menesia is not afraid to offend him, which often makes him a problem with his critics. For example, goes a little further (and admits it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he probably does in heaven now. <br /> <br /> The main message for Minsia in all his performance is that we all have a voice and that we must use that voice to talk about what we feel and do not fear being offended. It reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression and that we must use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, show it on Comedy Central.
