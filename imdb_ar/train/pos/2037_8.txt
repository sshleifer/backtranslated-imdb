Christopher Smith is clearly a fan of horror and this is evident in his first film, "Click Crawling". "Crawling" Although it is a bit loose on information, it proves to be a true real classic. Less glamorous than the recent American horror (Amityville Horror, House of Wax), this horrible dark story follows Franka Potente through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and deserted railroads, and a number of others along the way, . Although some bad reviews have identified this film, I really believe that under a tight budget and a British production of director Smith for the first time, "Creep" does not live up to its name. It actually offers a faster rhythm more or less from the beginning, sometimes it is very fast because the story is incomplete in some areas, but with an ideal location and a better personal reaction in the end I have seen it since some time "Creep" made some scenes that definitely represent nightmares.
