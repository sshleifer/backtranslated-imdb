(2 stars 5 stars) <br /> <br /> It's not a really good film ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look very good considering the meager budget it had to work with. The film is ostensibly an "episode" of a live Japanese live program that sends many contestants to a closed "danger zone", and has three repetitive crawls that are then sent to kill them. Survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune ... everyone else ends up dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that acting is very bad. None of the "real" people seems real at all. The actors who play the killers are a kind of fun ... because they are filming the most delightful and modern cartoons of the famous types of modern horror films ... This is exactly what would happen if this were a real show. The film pretends to be fully implemented ... There is one photographer following the contestants about the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the perspective of his camera ... but the lights continue to throb constantly (to hide the "cuts" from one to the other, I would imagine) .
