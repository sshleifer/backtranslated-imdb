This low-profile series based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) for her marriage named Jane (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a monastery. John York re-elects a congressman and chairs the funding committee. At the same time, Delia appears to be present when unexplained deaths occur. It creates chaos when exposed to a metaphysical exhibition, where the stores of numbers, treatment, healing, counseling, yoga, tarot and others are destroyed. Karen York charters a special character (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and alien events. <br /> <br /> This television series shows excitement, chills, frightening events and brutal killing. It seems that Delia like Damien sends a new murder every few minutes of the film, and horrific killings occur. The main excitement is to see the new and innocent victim that can be made by medium special effects. In addition, the humble league champions, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, despite being minor gentlemen, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and Don Davis, a recently deceased military captain turned into acting. As always, an excellent musical score was obtained from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The movie is dedicated exclusively to hardcore followers. The moving image is poorly rendered by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Gerrard. (Damienne) (William Holden, Lee Grant) without Taylor; "The Final Conflict" (Sam Neal and Tessa Harrow) for Graham Baker. Rating: Below average.
