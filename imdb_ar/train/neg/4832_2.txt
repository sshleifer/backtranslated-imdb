I was fascinated to see how the 2008 film, which had not seen much of the 2009 Best Picture Oscar, won, so I went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got for two hours invested is the grim assertion that this film won pure prizes for reasons outside the screen. <br /> <br /> The trend and visual style of this movie is one of the most vulnerable categories you'll ever see. When it is not busy honoring another character from Bourne Identity with disturbing and disturbing images, it presents all the hallmarks of a second class soap opera in terms of the lens. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is not well done, and the descriptions are as sophisticated as the comic stripes of Bethel Bailey rejected, and dialogue - in cases where the film gives up being a "minimum" and without a clear reason turns a soldier or two into dialogues Correct - from the worst recorded at all. In fairness, representatives do their best in these circumstances, not just enough to hide the extent of the project's mismanagement. <br /> <br /> The whole film feels that it is intended to "ironically" that the time it was recorded was humorless and therefore re-edited in the best possible way, to pass it as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours in this movie, it will be two hours and you will never count, wasted two hours because you will regret the rest of your life.
