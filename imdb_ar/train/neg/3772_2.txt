I just saw Dick Tracy and I think it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities looked awful. Mob characters also looked very strange. Warren Betty did a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but he certainly was not one of his best performers Madonna must stick to singing. Glenn Headley did a good job in this film. This movie was given only 2/10 because of the stunning representation of the Pacino. It was not a big job in his career but he still does a good job.
