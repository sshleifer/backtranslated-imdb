I may be getting older, but this person completely misses me and the old Bone Bone is quite old. Surely there must be a big mistake in this Irishman (this is me, Schultz!). O Lord, O Lord, what I give him to see the light! First, Phil Silvers's tremendous energy, intelligence and leadership were an integral part of comedic education and general education in life, if you like. Although it is possible that the series, which has the first title: "Will not Get Rich" (1955-1959 *) has got the CBS television network with someone else in the role of Sgt. Belko, it is very difficult to depict any other actor / comedian in the work wearing the sergeant's lines. <br /> <br /> Such a strong determination is inevitable, even though it is not the same as depicting a paparazzi career that proved to be due to some other players, such as Clayton Moore (The Color Ranger) George Reeves ("The Adventures of Superman") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> One of the major obstacles to adapting and successfully updating such a work from a television screen in the 1950s to a cinema audience in the 1990s is our collective memory. Without making sure of the percentage of crowds that reminded Bilco's character of seeing the original run and reviving the early guilds, and their numbers were certainly large; even a large segment of young people had seen Bilco's restart recently. It was clear that the new film and the source were miles. Or even light years. <br /> <br /> So do not think of it as an old square rhythm altogether, please consider some other points. <br /> <br /> Here today, the 14th day of November in the year of our Lord 2007, let me swear and under oath that I have been a lover of Steve Martin for nearly 30 years, moreover, I have enjoyed the intelligence and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartmann. After all, it was the talents of men like this and many others, NBC's Saturday Night and SECOND CITY TV who kept the last quarter of the twentieth century laughing. But BILKO re-made; it did not click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the movie has been filmed as a comedy service (I always loved!) but without Bilko Show names and giving it some identity, it would be highly appreciated by the crabby, elderly men like me. <br /> <br /> So, we already have many comedies and serials turned into movies lately, what's next? What about someone doing Hal Rosh in World War II for the Comedian's series of sergeants DOUBLEDAY and AMES and the first animated television series "RUSBIT CRUSADER"?
