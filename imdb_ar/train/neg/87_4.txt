I have read all the books Love Come Softly. Quite well know that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but in general they have the main point in the book at least. I was very disappointed in this film. The only thing they have in this film that is in the book is that Messi's father comes to visit, (although both parents come in the book). That's it. The story of the story was crooked and very attractive and yes, sad, of the book, so much that I could not enjoy it. Even if I did not read the book, it was very sad. I know that Pioneer's life was harsh, but the whole film was down. The rating is for the same family orientation of the film that makes it wonderful.
