The film version of Sandra Bernard's play by one woman outside Broadway is a tyrant. Sandra parody acts stars and stars, but her sense of irony is only interestingly decent, and appropriately funny. Her fans will say she is absolutely sincere, and that may be true. But it is also noisy, with an unintelligible Bravado, in your face, which is quite unsuitable for a movie of this kind. She does not want to be nice - she's definitely not out to make friends - and it will always rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if I meet them halfway, the materials here are badly lacking. Director Nicholas Rogge has been an executive producer, and although it is not his release, the film is unique in its unique style. Bernhard participated in writing the program with director John Boskovich; it was an odd touch to make all Sandra at home looking for sheer boredom - a feeling many real viewers would most likely share. * 1/2 of ****
