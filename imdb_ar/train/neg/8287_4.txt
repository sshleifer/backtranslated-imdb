This is a television version of the story to a large extent, and the film begins as a ring of "Xena ...", with little dialogue or description of meaningful characters. Become more substantial after a while, but all the characters are still caricature. <br /> <br /> Salma is a strange beauty. Richard Harris is a wicked Frollo and sexual repression, wicked to break the walnut in Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo are completely oblivious. <br /> <br /> Frollo is also a liberal version of the story, an inhibitor of enlightenment, such as the abbot of the "name of the rose", and Kasimodo is the hero of freedom. The mysterious side of the quas character is ignored, even though it pours fluids on people. He really is just a stranger because he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> The movie may be for children, but I doubt it, since Frollo whips himself bloodily to adjust the desire to hit his monkey. Mostly the display is undesirable and forgotten, but not horrific, and sometimes amusing, of the tale.
