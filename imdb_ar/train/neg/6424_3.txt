The break will be a screenwriter and his agent (Tom Wood and Ari Gross) is forced to live in a self-storage facility run by a freaky and scary manager (Ron Perleman) who thinks he is the serial killer who terrorizes the city. Wearing ugly fashion). They convince him that his life story will make a great film and bring together a group of seasoned filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Christie Swanson) and discover that the art of filmmaking can be murder. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film, but unfortunately it was left on the floor of the editing room and shows (it is rumored that the studio wanted a dark comedy "lighter"). Our loss (and the actors, who all perform well and deserve better) is because this has an exceptional black comedy setting but rises to a nice level. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ron Perleman this is definitely worth getting just his performance. His comedy timing is excellent and he has a chance to do some really great impressions (he was not joking when he said in a Hellboy commentary that he needed to intervene when Jerry Lewis came in). It's simply fun to watch in this one. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in the role of dual scene (but pivotal).
