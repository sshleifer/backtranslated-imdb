The premise of this movie is revealed on a DVD box. Factor tissue fabric develops miracle not decomposing. But the film failed to get it. Instead, it lasts for 45 minutes and flows around the preamble before it is discovered. Because the audience does not benefit much from seeing a child imagining things, it is a strange choice: the film has been banned from participating in any topic successfully. Once the fabric is discovered, the film quickly proves that both industry protagonists and blue-collar co-workers want to invent the invention, leaving the film with two simple movements: the invention of the chemical, and escape from the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why anyone describes this as a comedy. Tone is not funny or comic. It is like the dangerous social critique of today: capitalism is distorting both supply and production chains. This in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, this may be true, but without some play with a position towards this fact, the film is just a serious argument. You'll need a very broad definition of comedy to find any of them here. <br /> <br /> This is very similar to the interview of the British with John Doet (Meet Nigel Doe).
