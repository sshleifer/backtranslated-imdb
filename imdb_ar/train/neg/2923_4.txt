The plot was very interesting, with the background of the Russian Revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest where the film was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry among the 2 main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really harsh, almost icy. Rob Stewart was very charming and friendly, so she looked like his big sister instead of his girlfriend. The end, when we finally discovered who was behind them, was very weak and had no meaning at all. I think I would have enjoyed this film better if the relationship between actors is a little more reliable.
