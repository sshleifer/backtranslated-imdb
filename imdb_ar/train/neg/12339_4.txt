This comedy contains potentially funny things, surrounded by many deceptive things. Almost every scene that includes the castle's servants and their absurdity is a waste of time. The layout is so dirty that it makes you wonder if they already have a ready-made text before they begin filming it, or they simply do everything while they progress. (* 1/2)
