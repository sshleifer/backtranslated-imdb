The film is very cheesy and boring, with the intention of being hip and modern, appearing in the editing style and some strange camera angles, leading only to drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is wasted, writing stupid and patriotic. The only thing worth it is the first-rate soundtrack to Lalu Chifrin, truly brilliant, as well as the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Running if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this click are well worth it; it's really pure garbage. Of course, this is the magic of watching a movie everyone will not meet on a beer cup if it's blazing, but keep it for a rainy day where you have nothing else at all.
