This batch of horror masters was awful. Mr. Carpenter seems to need to learn a thing or two about the pace of dialogue and reasonable dialogue. There were times when I literally screamed on TV for something to happen. He may think it's a thrill, but Carpenter needs to reduce his excessive musical score (or his son) and go ahead with a little work. How many times the girl said, "No no, I can not have this child!" And "Oh, does not it come here"? Carpenter takes elements of much better films (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and casts it here as if he were supposed to recognize and appreciate his trademark style. What we lack here is the real thrill and energy. It seems like he slept during the filmmaking process. <br /> <br /> To get better movies from a carpenter, stick to the tried and true classic movies - The Thing, Halloween, and Live. For the best masters of horror episodes, check out your personal favorites: Family, Jennifer, and Dreams at Witch House.
