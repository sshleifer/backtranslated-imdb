This film is very boring, tells the story of a gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting happens at all. The director has "kept her real" and feels like a camera that follows a woman as she lives her life. I had to watch other films by this director to separate, while others were not boring. This movie was also watched for a mission ... it's better to deserve boring with a good grade !! In general, unless it is required, you do not see the movie. But do not reduce the other films to this exit, because it is not bad ... And do not reduce the other films from Africa, it is usually good, especially when performed by a Western director.
