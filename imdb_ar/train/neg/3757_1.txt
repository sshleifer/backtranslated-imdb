How did this come into being? I generally like science fiction F / Bigfoot no matter what movies. . But I still expect to be written without a lot of cheese like this. The effects were sad, and the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I ended up renting it because it was in the wrong situation (I was looking for Sasquatch film with Lance Henrikson in it - I still have not seen it) The idea of ​​the film is actually a good idea. There was a lot of potential to produce a wonderful little movie here. I do not understand how it ends up like this. Go to the students interested in Cinema / Arts / English at any high school and you will find people who can write better text.
