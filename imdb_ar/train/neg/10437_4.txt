Curiously impressive, despite the dramatic comedy drama of the soul about a strange young man hoping to fly like a bird in Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman is a quasi-comedy directed with strange characters filled with strange roles that begin to scream early in weight. Some films are impressive, and Shelley Duval is a stitch at the beginning as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch of the glamor of seeing Bud Kurt as a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and the producer if Adler were to explain this role to her). !). In the foreground, Bud Cort - once again, after Harold & Maude - became a genuine original; not like getting away, for example, Michael J. Pollard, Kurt manages to be an eccentric genius, idiot and non-aggressive, a difficult job to withdraw. Unfortunately, this is one of the Altman imbalances. He can have a team of actors and a wonderful show that is unrivaled, but let him shoot some misleading inspiration and look down. ** from ****
