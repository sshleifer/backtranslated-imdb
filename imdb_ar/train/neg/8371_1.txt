I think it's safe to say that this is the worst film ever made. When I saw the trailer on television I knew from the first moment that this would be part of **** and would be better avoided, but I somehow drifted to see this By some friends, I walked to the cinema with low expectations but I was hoping there would be some cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring a face, they consist mostly of people beating the face and balls, and the child looks strange and acts like horny gangs and jokes the usual race that we see a lot these days comic garbage. The film is clear and the story is not only impossible to believe, but predictable and boring. Extremely annoying characters and highly stereotyped. I never want to see this film again. I'd rather shoot a bullet in the foot instead of going to this piece again. If anyone I see says they love it, I'll beat them physically in the face
