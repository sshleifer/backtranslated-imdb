I found the "Arab conspiracy" in a bargaining box and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. People, there is a reason not to hear too much about this film. The plot is muddy, the rhythm is slow, Cornelia Sharp almost funky like a simple tofu, and the end leaves you flat. So Sean Connery can not save this one.
