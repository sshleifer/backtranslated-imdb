To be brutally honest ... I loved watching Severed. That's why I gave her a 1/10 star because of her unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> Story / photography / acting / everything. This film was eager to watch. If you enjoy <br /> <br /> watching bad movies to enjoy them, you will get a kick from Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really does not matter, it includes a bald person <br /> <br /> It has a sword and runs randomly at people. <br /> <br /> But he has an extraordinary development ... nobody has seen him before. <br /> <br /> Even when, in an unforgettable scene, he enters a stale nightclub and hits some spaghetti and no one sees. <br /> <br /> Severed does not look like he was filmed on video - he was filmed / <br /> filmed on someone's home video camera. Filmmakers had <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very high knowledge) and the composition <br /> <br /> actually held together in some scenes. But mostly you can not hear <br /> <br /> actors ... you can not understand what they are doing, and laugh <br /> <br /> When the next pumpkin is eliminated from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support movies like this - they are shouted and <br /> <br /> hustle!
