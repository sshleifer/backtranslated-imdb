There is a reason why some movies are going directly to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if they are very hooligans in front of the theater audience, they should launch the video directly. Of course it would not be fair to really have good movies yet be launched directly into the video. This is no exception although the film has good actors or at least potential actors: Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunn who deserves the best or at least the best agent, and Sarah Thompson deserve the roles that are out of the teenage melodrama. The film is also cheesy: This film is made before cruel intentions, so this film is really a wonderful and stupid movie to some extent. This was a waste and a real movie at the same level as soft porn movies and pay-per-view masturbation movies. Fortunately for the actors, we hope they can clear this from their autobiography. So if you're looking for something nasty, but you do not have the courage to buy porn, rent this movie as a start.
