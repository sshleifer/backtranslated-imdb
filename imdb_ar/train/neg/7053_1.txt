Well, I promised the comic boredom and the people went (few) to watch it as the first release of 2006 is not bad, or for that matter of any year, because the first and last films mostly flounder except for Ghajini and some other films. <br /> Well, To JAWANI DIWANI <br /> <br /> The short film revolves around Iman Hashemi, who does his usual things. Unfortunately, it's annoying this time after repetition. He has Hrishita Bhatt and upset Selena Gaitley <br /> <br /> Controversial dialogues, comedic scenes, poorly treated drama and lots of gaps <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, fortunately now he is young But the release of FOOTPATH, MURDER and some decent works in some other films, the actor took a back seat and the directors focused on his tribal image and the woman who lost her grief by touching it after repeated Hrishita and Celina bad Mahesh is terrible
