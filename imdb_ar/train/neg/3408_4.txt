I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember them clearly. We were learning about space. All young children want to go to space, right? Well, having seen that, I was so scared to death that I accidentally bumped into space with some psychotic robots with one mind. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some news program or something. I think it was my own story when people were afraid of the radio show "World War". So, recently, I get this film back to watch it, and I realized my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I laugh at the dramatic parts and the hardest laugh on acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, moving in a slow motion, have you noticed it before? I do not think being in space makes you talk slow or you think it's slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy sinks unconsciously through the oxygen tank and starts to move inversely with the security doors closing. Little Max tries to attract her. Suddenly, we get close close to Max's face as he screams (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happppeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I have no idea.
