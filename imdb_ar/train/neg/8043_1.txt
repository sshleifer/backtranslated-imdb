I usually have a problem getting away from a bad film, yet this was a unique case. The film was so bad that I actually sat in almost everything, it was supposed to have a minute of good film time to justify an hour and a half wasted. Needless to say I was wildly disappointed. This film is located in a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating a holiday, and this film suffers from many problems that make it worth watching. First, there are gap gap gaps. Second, very few actors on list C (so I dare not call it "B") can act with the value of a curse, so any scenes may fail miserably. Thirdly, the film's rate is very fickle and embarrassing to watch most of the time making building suspense extremely difficult, resulting in very few surprises for the audience. Fourthly, most importantly, the end is completely hostile to the climate, partly because of how it ends (determining who will be the killer) and partly because the dialog box is terrible. As for the film balance, it's the only film I'll ever say. It's the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, just like the bad joke you would get if you do not feel happy at all, next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you do not scream, you're not doing it already in the opposite direction .
