At any point exactly is a good movie bad? When does the movie move from "watchable" to "Where is this switch & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF"? Thank God for DVDs, like this one, which can borrow from the library - for free! Similarly, thank God for the fast forward switch on the DVD player. I feel sorry for those who were cheated at the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I completely forgot because now everything became unclear), "our hero", Luke Wilson starts running through the traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. At that point when I surrendered, I realized that I did not care if he had found his trip or was run over by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was fun was when Locke stepped up from the landfill, the hair dryer at hand, and for the first time met the "heroine", Uma Thurman. This scene ended with the pursuit of the criminal, who, helplessly, bursts out of the fire, away from Luke and Uma leaving. This was the last time the film was funny, and when was this scene? Ten minutes after the flick? <br /> <br /> Every time the film tried to become "funny," he could not. Each time the film approached the "excitement," the film faded in reverse. When the musical result helped bring life out of this splendor, the sound track remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were not required and were not lame; damage to sets and props was unnecessary and childish. When Uma turned to the crazy former girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "The Old Year of Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction" when I realized there was no turning back because I totally hated "The Old Year of Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> Rainy Wilson (also seen in The Mimzy) "The Last" Mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this horrific film. If you see an opponent of Uma, Anna Fares, I would expect Jason or Freddy to leap or terrified a frightened monster from behind the scene; once you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie, "this is all you see, regardless of the film, regardless of the medium. The character Wanda Sykes played was just awful and was misplaced in this click.
