It is said in the last two weeks in the life of a mysterious woman dead in the memories of the past. Like a hobo, the film wanders aimlessly and uselessly. Mona, a lazy title character, groggy, addicted to drugs, is not beloved, and Bonner does not do much to make them interesting. Although there are some false dialogues that try to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motives are never clear. The occasional nature of the film, which includes some random characters, becomes cumbersome after a while, making it look longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that a young attractive homeless woman will not attract more men's attention.
