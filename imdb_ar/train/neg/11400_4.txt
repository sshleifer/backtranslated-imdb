The Hazing is a confusing mumbo-jumbo who desperately wants to be The Evil Dead until he refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that they are simply not in the same league as this wonderful movie. This movie is nowhere near the original. This plot was used by Kevin Tiny in the film Night of the Demons, and it was more fun. This click is lost a lot of time with a complex presentation before introducing children into the nervous palace and starting the demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Doriff, as usual, does not give much to do here, but when he's in a screen he puts it in another performance that would make Christopher and Ken jealous. As for the representation of children, it is acceptable but not good in any way. The action of the camera shakes more annoying than intelligent or atmospheric. There are a few good moments when the first man is possessed and wandering around some deadly lines while sending his victims, but they were not scary for a second. The bull level is medium to low, but the director tries to compensate him by showing the actresses naked several times. All in all, well if you have 87 minutes to get lost.
