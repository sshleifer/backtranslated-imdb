I can not believe I've actually seen this but I think I just wanted to know if this movie would be more entertaining and unintentionally entertaining to the end. And I did. The peak performance by defense lawyers was even poorer than ever - even from real life that even for a fictional story was very strange. No one on this planet can act in court as it did. Perhaps the worst prosecutor on the ground. Why was it in court anyway? He did nothing and did nothing to prove her conviction. A simple search of her home would have found the rings. But do not go would prefer to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the entire trial - it was. Crazy crazy drug was given the truth to prove her innocent but not Bret. The madman had almost an altar of Bret in her house that could prove her sick obsession. But again do not go. During the court scene, she felt the silent need to pull the needle out of her hand and hit it several times against her head. So the real eccentric does not look silly fake "I'm innocent" as I did. What does this film tell us? Never marry a woman who has a life insurance: once she falls on the stairs, her husband will be thrown in jail, guilty or not. Evil, men of evil.
