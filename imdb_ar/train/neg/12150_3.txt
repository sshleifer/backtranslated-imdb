Feeding the Masses is just one of many modern modest zombie movies that you will get after your hard earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say that the good old TheaterX took one for the team in that account. Guess what plots around? Zombie take over. This time, however, for originality (?) This film happens in Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I saw a flick of a zombie based in Rhode Island. A government-controlled television station is supposed to follow the "normal" broadcast so that no citizen will think of any problem in the world, that is, those who never look or go out, anyway. I will say though some of the commercials broadcast by this station may have been the most entertaining part of this film. There is actually a story to some extent for this but I do not bother it because after a while I will not bother or fall asleep. In any case, this involves a lot of horrible behavior to throw all the things "seen before" that are acquired before the camera. Trust me, you can find lots of other things related to your time of watching this. 3 of 10.
