LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacy. John Heard. Curry Aloys. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a moment. Justin Timberlake? Which star? I should have known better than renting Edison Force. In fact, you know better. But at the moment of absolute weakness, this STV is hired. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in the STV, you know that it is one of two things: an independent dog or a dog. As in the sat on the shelf. That's what he did. And for good reason. The plot includes as such a group of corrupt murderers of the police, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only brave enough to detect them. He is targeted for his efforts - or perhaps I should say because of his terrible actions. I closed it after one of the bad guys was shot through the front and the master still has to turn into the shooter and smile before he collapses. Just awful. The real advice to how bad this flick is is to see Freeman on the cover and during the film tampering with a wild beard, does not look like a hobo. You only know that the director was not in control. Freeman breaks down clearly.
