If this is a producer of 2008 from one of the largest production houses in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), I am afraid it is desirable to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can make a mistake in this length with such a huge star from Anil, Akshay, Saif, and Carina, then the film industry still has to be studied harder by everyone associated with this film. The film lacks almost all sections except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has a few good dialogues to present, but this alone can not make you enjoy the discussion with high expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car heading towards the river from the mountain contains very cheap drawings such as an animated film scene. This in itself was a clear indication of the director's vision. Every representative representing a credit for a film is simply lost. Anil Kapoor's trick to try good English lies most of the time. Saif will certainly be thinking about why he signed this film. <br /> <br /> In short, it is the largest resource type after "JHOOM BARBAR JHOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a more enjoyable film than this. <br /> <br /> One can not understand how and why this type of text was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of the Akshay love story. After the wrong scenario the weakest point in the film is music. Vishal Shekhar gave some melodies to each song. The songs start well and suddenly the rhythms go down dramatically. Only one song "Falc Tak Shaw" is fairly good in a lot. An opportunity missed by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> With regard to the intelligence of continuity of the manufacturers, only sampling of this: Akshay and Saif on the road in a mountainous area of ​​a foreign site (perhaps Ladakh). In the next scene, they look for Carina in Haridwar and then go back to the hills with Carina in their car. I'm still thinking about who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you can sit down until the end, it will culminate too long with silly and unnecessary skills. You can see all the heroes walking through a storm of bullets and did not hurt as if they were God. Are we still watching a film in 2008 with all these technical gains? So, no more words about this pitiful movie and lowering the level, but the sincere request of senior representatives of their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, if possible, please request a preview of your films after their first release. Outside. As artists of this stature, you have some responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People are still applauding you as you enter the screen in your first consecutive scenes. I think this type of film should not see the light of day because it hinders the reputation of all those associated with the film and the actors and the production house alike.
