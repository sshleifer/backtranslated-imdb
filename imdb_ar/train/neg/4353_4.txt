The episode is a comedy series depicting a group of his 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that chapter is not funny, although it has clear potential. It's not corky enough, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to the slow pace of the lack of really hilarious punch lines. Some representatives also face difficulties in timing. <br /> <br /> The most creatively written characters are the twins Kat, Lena, and Rebel (Lizzy Kaplan and Heather Golden Hersh) but even seem to be just a very small box for the program. On the other hand, the characters I find most creative are the main character Ethan, Duncan and Nicole, who are used to being together. <br /> <br /> What annoys me in this series is that the only Latin character Aaron is being picked up by is his tone (though not respectable figure, but anyway).
