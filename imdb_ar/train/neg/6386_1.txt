I really wanted to like this movie, but it was elusive. The acting was a severe hammer, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, Soooo. All the time sitting in the theater, I wanted the film to end. Twenty minutes in a film and call it to an end. Sure, some pictures were nice, but guys come on, really mean! For a film about a man who sets up magic machines, there was not much music to talk about. The music there was annoying and boring. There were loud noises sometimes loud, and those were also annoying. This film has mainly succeeded in keeping me away, and crawling at the same time. I need to go to see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.
