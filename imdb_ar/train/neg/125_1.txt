If only to avoid making this kind of movies in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but does not tell a compelling story. <br /> <br /> You may feel privileged to sit down because it addresses many important issues but does so without any noticeable motivation. The viewer does not come away from the new perspectives (unless one turns away from his vision while one is walking in his mind, as he always does during this senseless film). <br /> <br /> You might spend a better time looking for a growing tree window. <br /> <br />
