This movie is very bad and gets worse in every imaginable way. Not only is the poor acting a scenario nor is the lame time and bad one wasted to watch it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggle of writers and film producers to try to make it funny. The actress who replaces the descendants of Jean Reno is an old and learned lesson in the first film so she adds a new girl to be married. Almost all original additions and accessories come back, but this time it makes me want to take my eyes out of my sockets because it is a waste of a very good film. The constant torture of the camera and the footage in any scene in this film can put the viewer in a violent cage. This second film takes the original successful version, takes it out of its coffin, reviews the body in the public arena and not only undermines the idea of ​​the original idea and its heritage, but also analyzes our intelligence. This film unlike the fir goose can not fly because it has no plot in the returning managers about the "necklace". There is no text because it was written and added daily. Do not pay attention to the camera or shots in mind. Bad lighting and special effects in order to do this. This movie will not even pass to a student film in the 101st film. How to Overcome This Heap No one can say. It was a big investment and it seemed that no one had the strength to remove this cruel and unnatural error from our misery. This movie has one good part ... Finished! This film is my worst film ever, and finally "Howard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
