Casper Van Dien accidentally stumbles on an old 40-foot mummy that is well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and invite the Jewish translator to help know his history. The mummy, as described at first, is the son of fallen angel, one of several giants that existed in "those days". In order to save his son from the devastating flood that was expected to kill everything, he consoled his son, and buried him with many servants for centuries - plans to wake him years later. In our present, fallen angels are still walking on the ground and the dead are back again and ritual is expected. Most of the film is slow, and it involves a lot of Bible folly and poor air punching battles. The mummy looks decent but does not appear nearly enough. It was supposed to have more to do with it, but it went on a lot ... you do not care.
