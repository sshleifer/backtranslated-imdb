Maggie Smith and Peter Ostinov as an unlikely couple in an unpopular film. <br /> <br /> The film shows Ostinov's promise to get out of jail for embezzlement. He persuades Robert Murley to leave so he can carry his identity and start hacking into a very cool company run by Carl Malden and Bob Newhart, the other unusual duo of the movies. <br /> <br /> Morley seems just as he did in 1938, Marie Antoinette. Maybe, he needed to go back to that kind. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. It's hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith changed her ways completely and made Oscar's performance crashed in "Miss Jean Prodi's Head." <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith is made here to be a dark red head, but by the end of the film she is the brains of the costume. Too bad writing did not go with it.
