On her way to a small town off the beaten path (but suspiciously close to a highway), a reporter collides with a strange traveler who agrees to help guide her to her destination. In the first story, the adulterous couple plan to kill the woman's husband, but they end up suffering a much worse fate when they are attacked by a coma; in the second story, a group of campers are kidnapped on their leave when they die Illegal outlaws are very angry at his arrest. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes. In making a coma selections under the title of a beautiful idea, but with only two stories, it is very short. This is not the only way for the low-budget flick to deliver: representation is lousy (with Joe Hagerty, like Ebenezer Jackson's tale, which presents one of the strangest shows I have ever seen); The scenario is dismal. There is a sexy scene without nudity; the result .... well, that beggar's belief. <br /> <br /> To be fair, some of the creative work of Sykes in the camera field is effective (although the subtle technique used as a character spinning through the jungle is a small boy (very tired) and guru Chippo Joe Castro is excited: Bite, remove eyeballs, remove the face, fall minds, there is a lumped head. These positives almost make the movie possible, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles do not roam the park, even for experienced Z-trash viewers. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but raise my rankings generously to 3 because I could not watch the movie while taking advantage of 3D (although I have doubts that an extra dimension would not have made a big difference).
