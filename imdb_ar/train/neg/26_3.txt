Assuming that this will not end with a direct release to the video, I would say this title is void at all costs. This is unless you are bored of good films and well executed. I saw this last night at AFI Dallas, and left with the remaining 20 minutes, just because I did not care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director ... this is embarrassing). When you can spot a dummy in just 5 minutes of the movie (a shot outside, a broken window before any shots are fired ... then the window explodes with the first shot), things will get bad. Let's just say that this is just an indication of the things that will come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'll give you all the details, but this is uneven in every way, even the unequal representation by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect acting on his part. And the scene of rape ... Christ! The word "shut up and take it" should never be used in a place to be raped. Absolutely. <br /> <br /> 3/10
