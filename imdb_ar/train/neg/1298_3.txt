Sugu Ishi can be a skillful film director under the right circumstances, but Gujuy tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a descendant of the Genji clan. Filmmaking is characterized by the main features of low-budget production, including blurred fighting scenes and clumsy tunes (the kind you might find in Dorma minus production). The monk tells his spiritual mentor that his fate lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards the Gojoe Bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will make him directly opposed to every element of society at the time - but enlightenment can earn him. <br /> <br /> There is no absence of ambition, in portraying the conflict between the sacred and the world. Arty thrives in some photographs and editing helps to offset the method of making loose films. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
