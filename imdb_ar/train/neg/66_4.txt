I think I was attracted to this film because of the voice of the story and the lead actor, so I gave her a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Essentially, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) was appointed by police, in particular Supervisor Francis Hare (Jeffrey Rush), who is forced to continue to flee to form a gang and go against them to liquidate his family and family members. That's really all I can say about the story, since I did not pay much attention to being honest. Starring Joseph Beren, Naomi Watts in Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan in the role of Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherrett, Kerry Baramor as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Connaughn as Kate Kelly and Kelly Connaughn In the role of Kate Kelly Rachel Griffith as Susan Scott. Ledger performs well, for what is worth, and the film has striking moments, especially with a gun battle in the end, but I can not say I enjoyed it because I did not look at everything. Okay!
