In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as president of the United States; North Korea announced it had nuclear weapons. Pope John Paul II died after a long illness. A film called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps even worse that year. Now, in 2009 for another US president, there is another alibaba, a new Korean nuclear weapon ... and a movie in Blue 2: Coral Reef, which is better than the original ... but that's the same saying: "Get your fingers cut better than getting On cutting off your head. " This sequel is a very bad movie which made me feel very bored and uninterested. The Into The Blue 2: The Reef is a television series that lacks any credibility and dramatic weight, but it is ideal to show their bodies. Chris Carmack (OC), David Anders (heroes and alias), Laura Vandervort (Smallville), Marsha Thomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (the hills) are making empty and boring performances. I liked some of the previous films by director Stephen Herc (Critters, Bill's Adventure and Ted's Excellent Special) but in this film, he can not generate minimal tension, passion or entertainment. The characters of this film not only perform poorly, but also disgusting. Frankly, I wanted them all to die. The film from this movie is lame and seems to have been produced by a technical team making promotional videos for Hawaii hotels. In Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible film better than the original film, but that's the same as nothing, as I said earlier. Avoid this crazy movie at all costs.
