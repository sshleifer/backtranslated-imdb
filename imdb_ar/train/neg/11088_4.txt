It is a good film but lacks any real depth, either emotionally or in terms of telling the story. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events and this limits the volume of work to almost nothing, and also there is no real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is in the foreground, but it sleeps, and there is no room to review any of its representative muscles or supporting representatives. <br /> <br /> The story is simply a little, even after you never heard of the title, the end was clear, but unlike other films about such injustice, this film has no emotional impact, you do not really care about it , And it seems that the motives of overseas help seem more academic than attention to his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to stir up some feelings by using the boy who adores the hero of Carter but that seems compelled. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie but you can forget it right away.
