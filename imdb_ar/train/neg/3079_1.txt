My favorite quote from Crowe, when the car was coming out of the abyss, "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This movie was the most extreme film I've ever seen. It was dangerous to scare you, making it fun! If it was not for the mysterious science scene I was not here today! :-P
