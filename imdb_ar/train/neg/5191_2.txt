Ah, drab TV shows and pilots who were criticized together in the seventies of the last century to make TV as boring as movies! Some examples will be the game "Ride with Death" (the most hysterical cheese types), stranded in space (confusing and uninteresting), and San Francisco International (incredibly boring and incredibly confusing), this exotic image of Queen Martin glamor. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (though you will not know it from outside shots), he appears to be a failed pilot to display lame spy. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the main character Diamond Head, who looked half asleep for the whole film; his boss, Aunt Mary, who really had a strange rendition of his lines and his white hair as well as a tan that looked like he had rode; (Hell, I can not even remember her name) A skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking is not exciting or interesting; and his Zulu singing (again, I can not remember his character's name) that was not bad at small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian MacShane, who sucked up as a bad guy but still proves he is acting. Although the so-called "chameleon" make-up functions that were used to conceal himself were ridiculous. I have no idea at all what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the factory that caused him to wear him as a dictator general from South America. I do not care. The plot simply was not interesting enough to hold your attention for ten minutes at a time, let alone an hour and a half or so continued. Just call this - Hawaii FIVE NO!
