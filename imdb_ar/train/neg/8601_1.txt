Well, where do we start with these small gems? The mollusc molluscs begin to seize the small city of New England (?). Only one man can stop them ... This guy ... is Mike Brady! Now, if that is not laughable enough, stay with us. <br /> <br /> Mollusks are the so-called stock shots. Regardless of who attacks the molluscs or where they are, the same snapshot emerges from the piles of molluscs that spread everywhere. Keep in mind that this single shot occupies at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was devastating, pulling out, stealing your wallet, and your girlfriend, killing the dog, BAD. I'm sure there's something worse, but you're going to be under pressure to find him. It was the only gem ... you think about it .... Mike Brady! I must have studied a few night classes at YMCA, because it was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> As for the horror? This film should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They mollusks scream out loud. The entire rostrum can be avoided using a salt shaker or two. Watch this movie only in an MST3K environment, otherwise I will see some serious damage to the brain.
