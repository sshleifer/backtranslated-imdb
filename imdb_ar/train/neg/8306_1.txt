ET obsessed with dainty Smith Dirty. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, you will probably grow on a depressed, depressed or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how she craves privacy. Now poor rich girl Ashley Olson just want to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo has become a slope and said, "I want to be alone." How much ET did you make off this little girl? Does ET have nothing better to report? I bet there are a lot of people who do not really care about the colors on which their birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nicole ever won any of those court cases because of will and inheritance. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and Danielle Small? Could it be ET?
