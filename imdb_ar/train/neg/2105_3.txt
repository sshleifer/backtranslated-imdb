Bella Lugosi is a crazy, creepy scientist who uses orchids to attract brides to steal the essence of life for the elderly wife. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious !! Lots of freaks, plus a lot of stuffing and no conspiracy make this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces eventually fell into Hollywood fashion. The story never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless while watching it. <br /> <br /> I usually record some clicks like this low point, but the dwarf just added enough crawling and fun to get a few points.
