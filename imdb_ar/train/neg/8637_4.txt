More than a mystery film with some unwarranted horror elements in; average in general. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare that brings her partner out of bed and goes to her child's room crying and killing him. She wakes up. Then this man dies in the hospital spitting blood. His daughter arrives, and is able to contact her through her dreams (I think) and wants her to know who killed him before his body completely decomposes in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers would have understood it long before it was revealed. I'm not sure that the way he was killed would really work. <br /> <br /> In any case, the elements of horror are shattered: autopsies, a recurring dream of a man killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are then cut, and several shots of the man who is already decaying in nightmares and in his grave. I was a little surprised to see dedication in the end by Folsi to Clive Parker! interesting.
