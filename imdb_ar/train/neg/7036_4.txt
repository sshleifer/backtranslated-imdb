I do not spoil anything when I tell you that you see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If this is your thing, your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go to see her separated sister in the family palace in the forest. Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, she seems to have interests beyond family love. On the side appear a group of vulgar characters and begin to activate all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is very weak and the characters are very stupid. The woman continues to skirt even after her husband begins to turn into a jerk and hang around with pagans, so he continues to have sex with him. On the exploitative side of things, there was plenty of cold meat and two exotic couplings, but nothing was not better elsewhere. Oh, and the goat sex scene mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not reach the end. Exploitation fans will exploit them, but they will be left wanting more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
