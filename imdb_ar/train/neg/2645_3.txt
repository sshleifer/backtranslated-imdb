The final pairing between Nelson Eddie and Janet MacDonald is essentially a complete imbalance. The script is weak and has been poorly displayed. The film has no life in it. Eddie and McDonald were better off making a concert filmed for their final pairing. There is nothing wrong with their singing, everything else in this turkey has become too much.
