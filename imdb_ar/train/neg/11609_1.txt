I am not from America and I know what "wife exchange" is. When a presentation of this name was released, I was thrilled to see some of the sexiest moments of the show. But what I got was a real stupidity. The rule was misused by the title name, contains no adult content, no nudity, nor even vulgar dialogues (which have been widely transmitted via the Hallmark channel and I think they have modified / suppressed the content to make it elegant). <br /> <br /> The presentation gives a picture of the current US / Western family situation, excess toxicities, contaminated teens, and their family life. In each episode, two or two wives (correctly) were chosen to live in each other's homes and to change their family routines with his new rule. Sometimes it is clear to be good or too bad. In the latter part, each mother is returned to her husband and tries to conclude what she has done to each family in the past few days. It is the sucking part of the program where all the competitors were struggling for their rights. I was absorbed to see all these things instead of seeing some wonderful sexual things. I mean who makes this program, more so than the so-called "swap wife"; better to call it "mother swap". All in all it spoils all the great things represented by the real wife swap! <br /> <br /> Wife swap = show sucking average reality.
