In 1925, childhood friends Mary Dreisler (like Maggie Warren) and Pauline Moran (like Lizzy Braskins) oversee the wedding of their children, Anita Begg (on behalf of Helen) and Norman Foster (John). Before the ceremony, Mrs. Dreisler handed over her little bank to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity. Banker Foster can survive because of the wise planning of the mother. But Ms. Moran is worried about her wealth and loudly demands a full withdrawal. Other Warren Bank customers hear Moran's clamor and start questioning their solvency. Soon, the family is experiencing a financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Emma's huge and financial film was released at the beginning of the year and MGM wanted to release a new film from Dressler as soon as possible. as possible. Driesler strikes 1931, "reduction" and "politics" were still earning a lot of money. Dressler became the No. 1 Box Office Star in 1932, according to the standard industry compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated Dreisler's status, but production seemed unusually dirty and rushed. Cast well, look. More attention in the direction and editing, and some restores, have helped? Apparently, they needed it in theaters for holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Mary Dreisler, Polly Moran, Anita Beige, Norman Foster
