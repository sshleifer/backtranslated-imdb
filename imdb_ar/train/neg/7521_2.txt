Maybe you give this credit more than it deserves because it's Halloween, you're only in "Knott's Scary Farm" and you're in a mood to watch Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and cost only me $ 1. <br /> <br /> Normally I can watch a movie like this to get "good stuff", but I resisted the urge here and I'm still not sure why. It was clear from the opening footage that this was not a "real" film, not even a "B" movie. She is more in DeCoteau's "horror" movies, such as "The Brotherhood," which is filmed in a movie-like video about 50 cents (in fact, I was scared at any moment. One of his demented college boys came out of rubbing himself in his underwear or something This). There were no random shots (too expensive to do multiple camera settings) and flat lighting but ... hard to identify. There is something refreshing about watching a way out without money starting from a decent half movie. His doing an improper job is commendable, and this film has a lot of advantages - acting is not bad, photography is very good (if it's so bright it's not scary), there are some surprises, and it's all kind of ... different in one way or another. <br /> <br /> A group of university students (for some unknown reason) are stuck in the warehouse where they decorate the annual haunted house. A creepy old man gives them a devilish book and mistakenly gathers the forces of hell. This leads to people wearing the right outfit in the haunted house who are in it, causing much chaos and human suffering. Along the way we dealt with subplot a lesbian relationship complex and strangely studied - it is interesting that this pair seems to be almost the most in the film. Yes, there is a sexy scene, but it is not cheesy - or at least nothing more than you find in any legitimate movie about lesbians showing them having sex. It is unusual for a horror movie to take the time and effort to do so without resorting to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this that intrigued me was how he was clearly trying to emulate "stupid children who have sex and are being killed" in the 1980s. It's hard to take it because there are so many of those movies already in existence, and this kind has been to death. I'm not sure whether it's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to introduce another entry into this genre, without irony, as if it were still alive, but I appreciate trying. <br /> <br /> Which is why you sat down; sometimes you just wanted to watch a horror film "Effortlessly" without ambition. There was really a lot of setup, not enough loopholes, endless loopholes, deadly endings and cliches and the unfortunate public feeling of a film that did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers imagined ... At least the scenes of the haunted house were wonderful. I used to pay to go to this haunted house if it was present, and I was not reluctant to pay a dollar to see it on a DVD even if I never saw this again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** the potential spoiler **, but there was a neat little action with a vampire girl in the coffin: "I used to be terror, but I changed." Ha ha, one good.
