Even with actors with generally reliable names such as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give any depth to the film. Barely cleans the surface of the incidents that night of July in 1981. Kilmer passes only in suggestions as John Holmes, Cudro and Kate Bosworth are hoping to misbehave in other major roles; as Holmes's wife and girlfriend below the legal age, respectively. The rest cast has small roles so that it is impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Frankie Gee, MC Jayne, Delan McDermott and a Paris Hilton.
