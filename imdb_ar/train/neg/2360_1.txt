This comment will be the most rewarding ever, but I must do so to warn you of the atrocities that have been shown in the film Freddy's Death. It's not just the worst episode of the Nightmare series, it's with the worst horror film ever! It was boring, meaningless, and death-free. The terrible and tense 3D endings on top of CORNY kill enough to push this "movie" to the ground. However, it does not stop there, just add bad behavior, bad language, and a number of glistening cheese, and you've got this huge heap of guano! No wonder Freddy, as Robert Englund always played, had two post-mortem appearances. I would also like if I went out like that. This is a film fans strictly only, do not stare at our shame.
