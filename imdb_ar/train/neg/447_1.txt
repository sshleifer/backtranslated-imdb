Well, what can you say about the sitcom. There are often very lame, morale dedication, just plain easy. So this offer! I've got a dull mold, although A.Bynes is okej in her cheerful way, and the rest is just plain crap .... as always. We've all seen it before, and we're likely to see it again when you cancel this offer. The reason, let's face it, is a modest and straight show. Because most of the sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> Well, in short. If you want to see some good entertainment, you can instead stop for 20 minutes in front of the mirror. Do some faces and go ahead .... its more entertaining than this show!
