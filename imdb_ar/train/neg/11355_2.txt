"Nat" (expressed by Trevor Gagnon), along with his mental friend "IQ" (expressed by Philip Bolden) and "Scooter" always hungry (David Gore) are children of great dreams. They want to be the first to fly into space. Their dreams are encouraged by the first Apollo landing craft, Apollo 11, waiting for its historic journey on the launch pad near the place where the three were hanged. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the film. I found they did very well. The scene was deep, because the objects on the distance seem to be actually behind the axis of the viewer. I did not see the 3D movie, it was broadcast on HBO. However, I can see that there were no scenes that took advantage of the three-dimensional effects except fighting between characters close to the end. I also was not really impressed with the design of the characters. To me, they did not look like anything like a fly, especially in coloring. The unusual blue-gray flies were somewhat like me. <br /> <br /> The presentations from the staff were not bad, but they were not good either. I was concentrating many times on my computer over the story. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments making young children laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, like the jokes they will get in adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History is not followed in this movie. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, where the main focus was flies. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the flies in the film were fictional, and the flies were not in Apollo 11. I liked the way he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives to explore space. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not for the whole family. This is definitely for kids only. But, save this for a rainy day.
