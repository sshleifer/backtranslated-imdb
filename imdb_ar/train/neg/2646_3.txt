When anyone comes to a movie of this type of film, it is no exaggeration to say that an overdose of this great, unspeakable drug, "suspension of infidelity," comes into the hands of the powerful. <br /> <br /> Janet McDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigita, the woman Nelson Eddie has ignored since the beginning of time, but also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My response when I saw this was a silent wink of "Hune?" Where have you seen this before? It turns out, I've seen it before, but the film was created after this much. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a heap of forgotten oblivion made in 1987, took advantage of the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuel Burt who had no lines to speak, also wore a blond wig, and made life hell for soap actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every imaginable corner with the very low 1980s values ​​but probably an updated version of this turkey in 1942. <br /> <br /> In any case, not in detail, this is not an unforgettable film and is intended only as an information role Because it was the last time McDonald and Eddie, the very good actors but the great singers, were playing together "innocence" and "clean" romance they were famous for. After that you may need a cold shower, not because there are any steamy scenes here, but to get rid of memory.
