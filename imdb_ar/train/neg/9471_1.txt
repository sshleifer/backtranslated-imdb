Do not get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I did it frankly, I gave it a very low level. The only reason I see it is having a group of girls going (different story for a different time period). When I started watching I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two kinds of horror. There's Freddie and Jason the Terrible, where you and your friends sit and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and there's a movie like that. Cat in The Hat failed to create a temporary interest in me. While I watched the first part of it, I did not just get bored, but I felt as if I had somehow been violated because of the horror of the film. Mike Myers is usually great, I like the majority of his work, but something in this film did not click. One of the things that the other director / producers / writers / what was was that they refused to use any of the original book colors (red, black and white) on any character except the cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to pick up any of the original word (I hate using this word, but it fits). The book was like Sunday ice cream, colorful and delicious, the film was very nice and hard to swallow like sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a leprechaun whore.
