I was fully prepared to see this film. I was waiting a year until it was removed here in New Zealand. I should not have built myself too much because it was very disappointing and is undoubtedly the worst film for Clarke. There is a big mistake in this film. First, some of the gorgeous acting, especially Nick Stahl as the "bully", the girl with curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most of it was incredibly elusive and incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran in Clark films now and was very brilliant in "The Children", but in "The Bully" he invests his lines with skill such as turning his scenes into a mockery. The script felt like it was written by a film student in the first year. No sorry, high school student ... someone has never seen a movie before. I could not understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaning of these children? Sure as hell did not stop him from getting damn good curse. I'm not proud but I did not need to see the breasts and buttocks of the teen every 5 minutes. I still emphasize that the best film for Clark is "Another Day in Heaven". It's great and I do not think it will beat him.
