How can Ozzy Osbourne still suck? I just do not get it. Trick or treat managed to do this. This absorbs and loves it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies that I have to warn people about. It is a terrible horror that causes vomiting only to plead so you can watch it until you feel much worse about yourself. No recovery factors are to be deceived or treated. <br /> <br /> For a film about heavy metals, he certainly does not seem to know what a heavy metal is or what it represents. This film was able to give a heavy metal look to the metal. This was in 1986, and it was probably one of the strongest heavy metal watches. This is a wonderful achievement, however negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = Very Bad, you will get angry from yourself to watch it. This simple equation is hopefully to keep you away from this restless movie.
