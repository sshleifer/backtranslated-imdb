I love films, I will watch any movie all the way, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a film I can not watch all the time. The representation is terribly monotonous and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer geek did it downstairs from his mother with minimal programs, ..... only long scenes ... walking !!!! This movie is three hours long !!! I did not prepare until 15 minutes until the DVD was transmitted quickly. The sights with foreigners are very short. Ummm, instead of naming these "war of the worlds", the name of these "long distances in the war of walking." This costs $ 5 million to make! What they spend on money, exciting opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but in a positive note, there is one scene you need to watch is when aliens start killing people. This is hilarious, not because people die, but because when they resort to skeletons, they still play for 20 seconds afterwards. <br /> <br /> So .... as I said, if you are a fan of boredom, senseless movies and action, here's a DVD set for you. But I did not write this for you, I wrote this for billions on the billions of other people who would hate this film. Not worth your time or your money <br /> <br /> I know this book, but this book was not long, I book a book worm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get a copy of Steven Spielberg, not all that good, but it's 10 times better than this! <br /> <br /> I give this a big picture, FAT ZERO out of 10.
