I've given up trying to figure out what version this I'm watching. Copyright in the end refers to 1983. Although this is not the important thing in my objection to this film, I will say that watching a film that was clearly created in the water age (including hippies with long hair and hateful station vehicles) With the 1980's disturbing soundtrack synthesis. Very annoying. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is how to dare to film BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. How dare you. <br /> <br /> Seriously, everything is so adorable and stuff but in the two films I've seen in - this crapfest and the excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill it. <br /> <br /> I would like to inform the film industry. Pamela Franklin seems to have retired from work, but if she decides to do another film and some of the director's sudden output tries to kill her, I do not ask him to go outside. <br /> <br /> Nobody misses Pamela Franklin and goes with her. I'm totally cross. The anger was unleashed. <br /> <br /> For B-movie lovers who are looking for festivals, you can do worse. On the plus side, this is not a diabolical film in a circumspect and cautious way - this film is a blatant demonic film. <br /> <br /> Diabolical celebrations stretching from wall to wall, cluster associations, hallucinations, and ironic merral attack - what can you ask for. <br /> <br /> These excellent things are almost spoiled by the baffling graffiti in the 1980s, which perfectly matches film as much as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear in The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Also, they made Pamela Franklin crush her charming English accent, which was also very rude, if not cruel atrocities (against the viewer) like you might find in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say that we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak with her own voice. Who is with me? I can forgive everything else about this film if they do not abuse Pamela Franklin. So I throw the gauntlet, gentlemen - anyone Pamela Franklin meets with me, even in a virtual context. <br /> <br /> Good day, gentlemen.
