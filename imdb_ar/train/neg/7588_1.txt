Warning for potential viewers: If you're looking for an adjustment to the classic "Most Dangerous Game" story, look elsewhere. "Seven Women of the Devil" <br /> <br /> Only superficially do the original work using the name Zaroff and say the people who kill the character. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be considered by some to be spoilers. or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zarov plays writer / director Michelle Lemuen. While his grandfather was hunting men because they were the only prey that was a real challenge, Boris's victims were often in a position where they could not defend themselves. The film spreads from place to place with almost complete blurring. It seems that the director has completely ignored and left the viewer with a boring film. Some of the individual scenes are fairly interesting (such as the torture rack sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are more interested in a variety of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at different stages of dressing may find the movie to be seen. Most of them will find it best to spend their time watching Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> In a side note, DVD extras included a fair amount of information about the movie's history. Apparently, it was banned for several years in the mother France which greatly ruined any opportunity to distribute them widely.
