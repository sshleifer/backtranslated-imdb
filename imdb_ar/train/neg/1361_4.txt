I was excited to discover this comedy that appeared in the late 1960s and that was staring at some of my preferences - Maggie Smith, young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ostinov. I have doubled my disappointment in the discovery of the film does not work as a comedy or a perfect theft film. Ostenov plays the little crook outside the prison, which is located at a large US company based in London. Austenov, former chief executive Karl Malden, and technology engineer Newhart, deceives himself as a computer expert, and immediately plans the "ideal theft" part of the film. To do this, it needs to pass a tamper-proof security system that guards the company's main computer. Here is one problem. His ideal plan works only because everyone else in the film trusts himself and impresses remarkably. Lame excuses are taken to him in nominal value and this should be the only computer center anywhere not bothering video cameras. The second problem is the occurrence of theft (fraud really) during the first 30 minutes of the film that steals the rest of the image of a lot of extreme tension. Maggie Smith is unfortunately a mistake as a neighbor or a secretary next door to a nearby Ostinov, and can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith but she looks here together very, very authoritative, and called the part to be more of the materialistic comedic actor. Moreover, Ostinov and Smith do not have any chemistry together, perhaps this is the difference of age, but the subsequent romantic relationship, devoid of real romance, is still a little swinging. Austenov participated in scriptwriting, and he thought it was good at the time, but I found it unfamiliar, curvy and wretchedly wasted for a great film.
