First seen on 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeeyes): Restructuring the labyrinthine horror of the 70 supposed spells of terror such as the thirteenth Friday (Versions 1 to 0 ??). I can not think of a lot of recovery operations here except (or can I think of anything?)? The story revolves around a group of stupid people listening to a radio show a year after some children were killed in the forest as a "salute" to this, presumably. But, her, one of the stupid people, has links to the actual event because her sister was one of the dead (again, how dumb she is so she will be part of this). guess what? The killer is in it again and we are annoyed at the start of it (so there is no mystery at all). Besides, where are the "policemen" and why no one is calling them. I can not believe this movie was funded by someone and made. Do you think that the American people will judge him now a little higher, at least in his experience of cinema, but not so by this film director.
