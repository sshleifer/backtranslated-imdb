A very modern story (keeping it in the thigh sensibly) The story of Dracula (despite its survival with traditional tradition) renews an interesting, if not fully immersed, story of the Prince of Darkness. The first time I tried to watch them, I could only reach them halfway, before losing interest. Again, start a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but for me, participation became less when New Orleans hits to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. It's a great place to set it up, but did not take advantage of its settings (despite the inscription on Paradise in Curse, where Dracula can thrive). Produced by Wes Carvin (and yes they throw that name there), but his books / narrated by Patrick Lucier. Technically, she had moments with a few dream-like images, but some kinetic liberties and cheap tremors do not help. The messy scenario does not get very silly. Lussier is a glossy work that remains somewhat glassy, ​​with lots of blood (make-up is properly checked) and lots of "virgin" ads. No, I do not mean virgins, she's a music company, because she gets a lot of footage and a Halsing daughter working there too. Oh this was not a clear cultivation. Sound is an amusing choice for rock composers. Presentations now exist throughout the store, but there are few familiar faces to be discovered (Danny Masterson, Shaun Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shen West and Luchelin Monroe). Gerrard Butler did not come in as Dracula, where much was not formed. He was simply glittering by the ladies at night; Jennifer Esposito, Colin Fitzpatrick and Jerry Ryan as Dracula's brides. The likes of Johnny Lee Millar and Justin Wadele are fine with respect. Christopher Plummer plays a great role as Van Helsing and Omar Ebs play a role.
