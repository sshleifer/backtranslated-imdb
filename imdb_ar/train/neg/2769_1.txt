This film is a timely warning to anyone who thinks he can write and direct the film. Face it, you can not. Because no one tells you when you penetrate big holes in your ears, you have meaningless, vulgar transitions, an unforgettable dialogue, and you can turn a rather cold Korean legend into a heap of celluloid. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie as a trivial popcorn film, I really did; I love a lot of crappy movies. But once I have to ask myself what happened in hell and why my dear God, why? More than a few times, I can not do that anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like someone to explain how Los Angeles became a resourceful in the last scene.
