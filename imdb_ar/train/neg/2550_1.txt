The line "in the tradition of American pie" was the one who tricked me into renting this film. What I got was an unwanted piece in the Jackass style, with the big difference that seems to be compared to this Jackass, the movie looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel sorry because I rewarded other films with 1 out of 10, because now I can not go beyond that. This makes some bad films look like cinematic exploits. <br /> <br /> I actually stopped it after 45 minutes, which is something I rarely do. But it was very boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? I dropped you on your head when I was a child? Or was it the first film I ever saw, so I got nothing to compare to it? Are you still a virgin and do you think of your breasts? There must be something wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this. Even if you are in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you will definitely regret it.
