Man, man! What a piece of thin filmmaking! But this is a pleasure to be guilty since my childhood although I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (directly on the Cupertino border) we had this thing named The G Channel on our cable system. Basically showed the same movie again and again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. She fell in love and lust with young Brooke Shields and loved her dupe adventures at the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script is almost meaningless, the trend is lousy, and few of the salient points are that Henry Fonda shows up, a lot of very bad dialogue, and that Carole King's nice song played at the end of the credits. Maybe you should stoop to enjoy this. Hey, everyone knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
