Wow ... pure shine. <br /> <br /> Turn excitement / thrill / horror into comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I have never laughed hard on a horror film before ... a silly plot with 3 characters that was developed madly - either not written in depth or much depth. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie written entirely with stupid dialogue, messy plot, useless scenes, lost characters, bad voice and poor development in general, this is what you should watch. <br /> <br /> Be sure to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and the completely ineffective police surveillance scene. <br /> <br /> This is a new noticeable decrease in screen performance, writing and sitting during the entire period makes you either stupid or bold or brave.
