I hired him last night. Opening (2001) on WAAAAAAAAAY ran too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some plays were postponed only. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was for less than two minutes. there is no problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, and Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute film <br /> < Everything else was either strange or stupid like hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some tips: If you want a hard film that spoils TV and movies, rent a Kentucky Fried Movie. If you want to get a movie and movies less deception, hire "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother to rent this movie. It will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best film is "Modern Problems"
