Well, what I can say, there are B-Grade movies and there are B-Grade movies and this definitely falls in the latter. But since it is clear that even filmmakers know it is not a reliable film (look at the final appropriations), it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot basically kills myself. He deliberately mixed his genetic material with some experimental acids that are collected and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the shape of a snowman - if you can believe it. Snowman, Jack Frost, after the rural town of Sharif put him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This film lacks any real fear and reminds me of the effects alone on B-Grade movies in the 1950s. This alone makes it worth watching for laughter. A film to spend time away.
