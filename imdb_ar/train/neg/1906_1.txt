They played this in the Twilight Zone Marathon on July 4th, and this is the worst episode of the twilight zone I've ever seen. It is not completely synchronized with the rest of the serial in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is a highly variable series and many episodes end up being hopelessly predicted, this episode was completely misplaced. Compare this to legendary rings such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such horrible material, and frankly surprised me that someone of his historical comedic status would descend to the level of this episode. Although he seems to be making some effort, he only needed money ... There is no other explanation.
