I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so hard to pay attention to it that it will embarrass itself by allowing this show to be implemented there. This offer is like a slap in the face of real serious law enforcement officers. I have never seen anything stupid in my life. If they have described it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say that reality is a fact does not lie. I only saw him once and I was terrified of what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy go into a chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would be. Nothing in the show was so close to the real world. The city of Munci, the police chief, and all the officers should hang their heads in disgrace and should never admit that they came from that city. No wonder he did not stay on TV
