I was interested in Kinda in this film as a cabbie flick. I was quite disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment that I felt watching on Friday XIII: Jason takes Manhattan. Lots of lost potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a grabber of decent attention. Then grind to a stop. Heavy breasts and luxury costumes in the 1980s can not help this film. The only things eating near this island of cannibal monks are piranha! I do not ask the level of the "cannibal incinerator" of the bull, but I was looking for a cheap exploitative gorge. I did not get anything from this. <br /> <br /> I found parts of the fighting scenes quite interesting, hence the stars. I do not think this is really worth the time it takes to watch it. I can see it at a party where nobody cares what happens and you want something in the background. But I will not tell anyone, "Man, you should see this movie." It is not good enough nor bad enough to warrant too much attention.
