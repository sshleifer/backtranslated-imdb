I've seen all four movies in this series. Everyone goes away from books. This is the worst yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book that is titled in any way! Producers and producers must have called it anything other than "the joy of permanent love". The only thing in this film that looks like a remote book is the names of some characters (Willie, Messi, Henry, Clark, Scotty and Cookie). Names / ages / gender of children are wrong. The entire story line is not a place in the book. <br /> <br /> I find Janet Oki, her writers and fans to make a film under the title "Untrue" in any way. The music is very high. Actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, it may happen. It's clean. You do not see it, however, if you're hoping to get a short copy of the book. I hope this is the last film of the series, but I doubt it. If there are more films being produced, I hope that Michael Landon, Jr. and others will stick to the original layout and story lines. Books are excellent, and if they are followed closely, they will produce excellent films!
