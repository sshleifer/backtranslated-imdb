MST 3000 should do this movie. It's the worst film I have ever seen. First of all, you discover that the shooter has no bank account and has no history since the army left in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person would ever let him be close to the president, let alone a high-level job. Also, the security chief for POTHUS will not be so emotional that he will start to drink fog if he shoots the president. This film sucked. I can not express the maximum that this film was. Every single actor was terrible. Even the chick in the garden trailer. I'm crap on this garbage. What a waste of time.
