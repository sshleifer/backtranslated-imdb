Those with knowledge of the former filmmakers know very much what they would expect: a small group of people trapped in a group of booby-trapped rooms, paranoia, bad behavior ... this film is a bit different. Almost half of the movie happens outside the cube, where we can see people who see people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero aspires to explain what the cube is about, but you really do not know much more than it was covered in the first two films. Sure, there is some kind of explanation in that, but it seems very lame compared to what was suggested in the first film. <br /> <br /> The Cube Zero seems fairly cheap (as its predecessors did), and the fact that it shows more than a few empty rooms only confirms this feeling. I was quite confident that there is no risk that any representatives will win any prizes in the foreseeable future. They have returned the traps from cube 1 (I mean they are almost identical, a kind of shame). <br /> <br /> I know that a lot of people appreciate this film and its association with the first film, but I feel it is a totally unnecessary contribution to a privilege that was not great at first.
