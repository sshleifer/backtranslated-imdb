In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to the show for this film a few months ago and I was disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate that the director produced a film about the men - a subject that is worth talking about in the film industry - representation in some parts of the film was old. The performances of Mark Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were fantastic. However, the director should not put himself as the main character in the film. Sorry Lin, you're not just a film actor. Stick to what you are good at in theatrical representation. The performance of Gina Hiraizumi in this film was also terrible. She should never have played a role in speaking and her appearance was inappropriate to play the role of Queen Miss Nesse. There were other young actors in the film who were naturally beautiful and their performances were wonderful ... Why did not they have a role in this role? Another major problem with this film was the sequence of motion. The Japanese-American soldiers did not seem to be fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Granted that this is a low-budget feature, but since this film was war-dependent, is it important to show some actual fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but certainly not very well distributed.
