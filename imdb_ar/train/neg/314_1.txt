I took this movie for $ 5 at a discount bookstore, Adam Sandler was a wonderful actor and I thought it would be a good film, well, it was not. There was no story at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian, "The F-Word" in every other word he said, usually did not bother me with cursing, but that was in the foreground. Worse, there is no story line in the parts where Sandler started to talk to the camera in random parts of the film. He reminded me of Dora Explorer when they ran and looked at the screen and asked you questions. The latter is that when they are randomly placed in bikini clips for girls at random times in the film. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it is a waste of money
