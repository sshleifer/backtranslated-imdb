This movie was terrible. Throughout the entire film, I was puzzled and saw no sign of it. I had to go to this site and read the review to understand what it was like in the end. This film is not worth watching at all. Not only is he sick and disgusting but totally stupid! Please do not see unless you are one of those who love watching bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society, its values ​​and its roles, this is a country I do not want to visit or bother to know. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it makes no sense. My friend and I sat there waiting to see if that was terrifying because that was what was included on the list. It was a complete disappointment.
