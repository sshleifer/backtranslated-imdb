Talk like a boiled u'an gangs. The story is not worse than any number of gang clicks, but I did not confuse this movie with Godfather I or II, or Godfiles. It's not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film so painful to watch periodically is that all these Italian Italians are sharing their hands in dropping bad gang lines in a worse false tone. Pachino could have been great if they called him "the doctor". I was looking forward to Abraham's visual vision, but their narrow dialects spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is not too hot. It was without Corleone to make this disappear after five minutes of meeting him, smiling and dancing on his back all the time.
