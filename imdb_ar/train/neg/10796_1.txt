This film proves that "commercial" cinema, or otherwise, Hollywood films are in serious crisis. There is no reason why this film should be produced regardless of whether someone expects to succeed on the basis of Shakil's name. The plot: It's a bit more puzzled than the knot. What else? The screen is fairly dim, O'Neill is a bad actor but Francis Cabra is worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
