How will viewers react to this new adaptation of Sherley Jackson's book, which has been promoted as not a new version of the 1963 original film (true enough), I will establish: Those who were great admirers of no one The original book or film is often thought of in this film ... and those who have never been exposed to any of these, who are great admirers of the current Hollywood trend towards "special effects" have formed the first and last word on how "good" the movie will love him. <br /> <br /> Things I did not like about this amendment: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a real adaptation of the book. Of the articles I read, this film should have covered other aspects of the book that the first one did not discover. This seems reasonable, no film can cover the word of a book unless the length of the string! (Not even then) but, there were things in this film that were never mentioned or even hinted at in the film. Reminds me of the way they decided to kill the black man in the original version of the film. I did not like it either. "We got the very basic and basic idea from Shirley Jackson's book, and we kept the same names and names of the eminent personalities (but not all), but then we decided to write our own story, and what we saw, we saw "We completely lost the theme of Parabicic's world, which invites a carefully chosen guest who all had a parakeet with their paranormal past, to investigate a house that really seems to be" Born bad ". No, instead, this "doctor" brought everyone to the house under the false pretext of studying "insomnia" (actually invited them there to intimidate them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rats, which he did not tell them They are never part of the experience ... nice guy). By the way, this doctor, who did not have the same name, was different from dedicated professional in the original film such as the night of the day. <br /> <br /> 3. In direct contradiction to the phrase used to promote the movie "Some Houses Just Born Bad", this house was not born bad but it became bad because of what happened there ... This time, The disintegration of the puzzle (shades of change). The only problem is that the so-called mystery was said inconsistently that I'm sure it is still a mystery for most of the audience ... But, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad to start with. She was the first "victim" to die before she had eyes on her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way of portraying Luke's character was very silly. He was supposed to be a haughty freak who was one day inheriting the house (and was a real skeptic in "history") ... At this time he was just an eccentric arrogant voice, stumbling and could not sleep (remember insomnia) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed by the way the film jumped from trying to re-create original scenes of the scene (the scene with the family of Neil's sister, and the opening speech of Mrs. Dudley ...) to embark on imaginative journeys that made me think Most of these films are other than hunting. It seems like he can not decide what he wants to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed listing Neil through the entire film. The original version was like a Gothic novel in the way the story was often told in the first person, through Neil's eyes, and we were always familiar with her thoughts. I lost that completely unique touch in the new version. They also tried to make Neil more heroic. The original Neil was not a bad person, but she was bitter (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life for a selfish old woman and a sister sister?) She loved Anin and lost her temper. This was almost good to be true. This was not much clearer than at the height of the film where it was evident that the writer was watching GHOST over and over again. <br /> <br /> 7. They have changed the history of the house and occupy a lot. There was no Abigail Crane (the daughter of Hugh whose legends loomed in the original versions), there was no "companion", and there was no custody. There was no "Grace" (the wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crane's wives died in completely different ways. These changes, the story changed a lot. I do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy, Shirley Jackson is no longer walking on this earth or she was ... she should be sad (if she got drifting !!!) with !!!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke (appropriate replacement for the word "house" for "movie"!): "This" movie "must be burned on the ground, sprinkle the earth with salt! "My favorite film of all time remains this way. No competition from this one.
