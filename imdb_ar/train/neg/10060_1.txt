The author begins a "discovery trip" to his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the fully forgotten and memorable "Bright Leaf" revolves around his predecessor. He is not, and in fact does not discover anything of moderate interest in this wonderful and self-fulfilling home movie, which is suitable for a show in the drunken family reunion (director) but certainly not for the commercial version - or even non-commercial. A good reminder why most independent films are not captured by major studios - because they are boring and irrelevant and do not concern anyone other than the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
