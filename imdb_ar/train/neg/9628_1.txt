This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The DVD was granted to me free of charge through an online request for DVD-related items. <br /> <br /> No wonder it has been given away, and certainly no one can give up money for this group. <br /> <br /> How can some reviewers say that they found it a joyful belief? The person who put it in the top five films ever appeared on this site. <br /> <br /> How appeared on the ground a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this litter is unbelievable. The humor is often in the toilet and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to entertain should avoid this at all costs.
