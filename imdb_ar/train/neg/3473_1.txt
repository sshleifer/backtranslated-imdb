This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever made. The plot is almost non-existent, and the representation (Affleck in particular) is bad at best. Ben Affleck fans are likely to defend this film, but they must agree in depth. As far as I can gather the plot consisting of Ben Affleck, a millionaire seller, is said to shrink before to go to a place reminiscent of his childhood and burn the list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. When you do this you end up paying the money for the family that is currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas ... that is it. The film continues, and finally meets the daughter of the family .... Blah Blah Blah.
