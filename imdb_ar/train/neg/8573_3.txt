I do not like Shawn Bean's guidance so much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no substance, it is painted with a kind of worn-out, anti-authoritarian modernity that, in most of Pence's works, has more recent works than it did before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn seem to be producing this vulgar product, ostensibly in some loyalty to the Secretariat, but it ends up being glorious in the glorious and moral wrestling matches, almost if the Hallmark cards have developed a line of greetings Hell's Angels, made me deal with delivery days, a wonderful movie. The representation of Viggo Mortensen is much more believable here than that funny thing of the Eastern promises he made with Cronenberg, and that is it. The film is meaningless, and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Glory to Charles Brunson, however, proves that he can act. I wanted more than Sandy Dennis. Bad 3 of 10 for this Indian runner nonsense.
