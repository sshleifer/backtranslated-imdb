I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I've done online. I felt the need to warn people of this film because it is already one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After reading his interviews with the director, he says he respects constructive criticism, so I will try to avoid criticizing the film for just showing him my views on why he found me so terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. Representatives. I know that the budget probably did not allow the adult workers but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years certainly knows some representatives who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredible lame make-up and special effects. Again, the budget obviously overlaps with what was originally intended but after working in make-up for many years there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. Clear similarities with Inn. Although you are not completely frantic, it is certainly trying to capitalize on the success of previous films. The only problem is that Ruth knew where he was going and how exactly to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Not at all annoying or painful so as not to be just sick but annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. Scenario in general. All dialogue was compelling and terrible! The sub-plots about the theater and the man who came to save them were as weak as they were almost like a later idea. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How annoying, not in a good way. Said Nuf. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the director's thoughts about my post (no doubt that his pages are on IMDb.) He caused friends ... what you were thinking. Sure, at some point during the filming or editing, I realized what Yolo had on your hands ... Sorry, I do not want to be tough, but you have to have a greater talent than this. I hope your next feature is gutterballs movie or wahtever best, hope to achieve advanced practice. <br /> <br /> But at the same time, avoid it like a plague. I want to repeat 81 minutes with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
