This film was very boring. Must be at least 15 minutes. The images of the killing of the child and the animal were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments but this was so bad as I had a lot of good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are just one step from the honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What can I say more? I'm sleeping through this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up for 8 hours. I think this is the same point. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between characters except perhaps two sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep as soon as you see them do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
