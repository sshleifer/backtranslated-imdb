First, I really liked Henry Bean, who put me in a very small group of filmgoers. Parker Bossi is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was a complete farce. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the additions - full of pride, resembling stars of Star Wars to no avail - a shift in the stomach. This noise on the part producers (HDNET) was realized to the extreme. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hull has ruined Henry Fowl forever. I do not think I can see him again in pure innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hull, you can fool some people in some time ... etc. The director would not be anywhere today if all he did was take out the trash meaninglessly. Unfortunately, it is a pure example of the lesson taught in Adaptation. The story must be exciting and active, or box office hopes are already dim. I do not mind a decent story. For actors, it was like trying to act in bondage. <br /> <br /> The result, I think Hartley, is tasteless. With drum hits walking around the dialogue. There was an Apple Soundtrack episode one I realized she gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they were just trying to attract a new audience. But it really is this ridiculous trip. I would be happy to spoil this film for you, but it was done. It is corrupt. Privilege FOOL Matt. Henry lives a lie.
