But this film was bear. The history part was good but the musical part was not. There is not one song I care about and I do not hear a voice. <br /> <br /> If Jesus was supposed to be "comfortable comedy, he would never succeed.If John Adams was supposed to be the hateful nagging song, they were trying to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> < Hancock and Jefferson were the only person to be tolerated in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Historical quotations and the debate about slavery in their historical history The context has been interesting enough, but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical play. </ br /> <br /> Should you not be interested in songs after a musical show, except for a few chords, there was nothing else worth breathing.
