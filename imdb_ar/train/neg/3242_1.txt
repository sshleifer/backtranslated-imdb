Here's a review for people like me. This film sucks from start to finish. I threw the popcorn on the screen and resorted to entertaining myself on the MSF2000 style. The plot depends on the events of the accident and depends on the stupidity of the people who are supposed to be smart. Lead falls to a man who deceives and does not happen to them they have deceived ????? It is rich ???? She is a famous scientist. Come on, people. She enters the bar at the most appropriate moment when everyone meets to talk about her deceit ??? It was so phased that it felt like a slap in the face even in front of the movie viewers. Rain man was insulted. I also admit that I despised Mamit's dialogue with this kind of passion in some meat-eaters, war-goers and fur-haters. My charisma is so complete that it challenges logic. But I will give him a chance. This is not supposed to sound so real. I do not care that everyone talks about the same. Mamit can not create characters; all he can do is thwart his voice relentlessly through various actors. No wonder his representatives are very wooden. They are confused by the fact that everyone is the same person. (However, his recent films are improving.)
