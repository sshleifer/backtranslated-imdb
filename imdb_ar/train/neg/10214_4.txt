Dick Furan and Biggie Moran, who were terrific in Mami's film, return to the show of world-wide horror. But this time, instead of being Wallace Ford as the owner of the comedy "Babe", we get Fuzzy Knight instead of a silly friend called "Stuff". But the results are nowhere near magic, the level of fear is almost nothing. <br /> <br /> You have a businessman who gets the idea of ​​driving the treasure hunt on a distant island inside a scary old castle. Peggy is one of the bands that come along for the ride. But there is John Carradine tall and slim like a black head and a big hat known as the "Phantom" who breaks the party in pursuit of buried wealth himself. <br /> <br /> This "ghost" is not a mysterious goal, and does not make any effort even to try to keep his normal face in the shadows to cause any tension or panic. It's always good to see Moran happy, but you can discover it as one of Universal's failures that you can forget right away.
