How can 4 out of 16 former voters give this film a 10? How can more than half of former voters give it 7 or higher? Who votes here? I can only assume that it is children - very young children. The truth is that this is a bad film in every way. The story is stupid. It is difficult to think of acting as a representative; characters without character. The dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy evening on the Sci-Fi Channel. In the sad event that is being re-broadcast at all, I suggest you read a book instead.
