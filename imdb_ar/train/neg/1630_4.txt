Mary Becford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after the death of her father, then has a love story. As fellow Snow Leopard said, the film is fairly accidental to start. Some of these things are amusing, such as Beckford flogging her church to church, while some of them are there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the romantic plot line recycled, surprising. The transfer process is very dark and the scene is difficult to estimate, but even so, this does not seem to be the best work by Maurice Tournor. Becford and Turner collaborated again in The Poor Little Rich Girl, which became somewhat accessible, and Beckford conceived as a young child.
