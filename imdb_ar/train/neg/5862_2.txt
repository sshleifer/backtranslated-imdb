Well to answer someone's question: "Why does nobody remember this film?" That's because, in fact, many people did not see it in 1978 and it has not been on television since. (If the video becomes news to me!) Even in the sometimes reckless comedy era of the 1970s, filmmakers were clever enough to avoid this film. Unless they love Billy Crittal, Paul Linde or Joan Rivers "that" so much! <br /> <br /> Paul Lind was more entertaining on the "magic squares" or "Hollywood squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this time of her career was laughing as she screamed harshly about the weightlessness of singer Karen Carpenter! Har Har-Joan! It also seems that each name is famous for "somewhat" of the era in the cast. (The most surprising is Doris Roberts later on "Everybody Loves Raymond.") Anyway, a pretty good idea about the story, a man who breastfeeds instead of a woman gets lost here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal gets a whore to finally lose her virginity, but because she was "in the lead" instead, she gets pregnant! (Comment on women holding positions of power away from men). <br /> <br /> A crystal stream is growing, passing through all female feelings and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now outcasts of his social understanding! I was attacked by a group of mobs who wanted to remove it (I think). <br /> <br /> He was forced to go to isolation to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you will, the manger (only knows where I came out of! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) that I am a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and can not be forgotten, humor at the high school level or less. <br /> <br /> Two stars for a good idea and good moments and touching moments / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it disappears a great time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Roddy McDowell signed it! (End)
