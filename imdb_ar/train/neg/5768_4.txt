Well, I was initially excited to download an open-source animated movie, just to destroy it as a pilot pulley. The animation is excellent, the lips sync horrifying, and continues to watch the film hoping to understand what is happening, just to realize that nothing has happened. Do not feel passion for characters, but feel pity for creators to waste their time. I have watched short films with weak passion in half the time! This can be an excellent short film, if they have time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone in the Blender is excited to showcase their programs and abilities on presentation, but sorry the story of young novels is what the film makes.
