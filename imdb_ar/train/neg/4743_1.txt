I'm here again at your local shopping center (of course, because this is where high school students hang out !!!!!) to show how wonderful "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" REALLY !!!!! To prove how bad this DCOM joke is ... <br /> <br /> ... We'll take the four Sumo wrestlers and put them in this picture booth. How warm ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hi! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How awful is it ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel gets its money back, with those 10-minute promotions, which makes viewers wonder, "When will this happen?" Then, suddenly, when that happens, for one, this not only got a higher TV rating than usual, but this was only seen once !!!!! Oh no !!!!! Once everyone !!!!! In addition, this film revolves around high school and things, and believe me, I will not go further with what is there ..... ..... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... Smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. 0/10
