Many people here say this offer is for children only. Well, when I was young (about 7-9 years old) I saw this offer first. It was disgusting to me. I talked with other kids about this, and sure, other programs and I know what? This was a measure of concealment. Whenever we wanted to emphasize the absurdity of something (on television or anything else) we said, "Oh, just like Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Before visiting this site, I could not imagine that there were actually fans of the MMPR. It was so strange to me that I decided to see it again and try to understand why people liked it. I did not enjoy this view. But the dawn came: Maybe I did not have enough imagination? It could be. But this argument is not enough for me to evaluate more than one star.
