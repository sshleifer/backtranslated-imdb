I love cheesy terror attacks. I do not care whether the representation is substandard or whether the monsters look vulgar. I liked this movie except for the feeling of daze all the way from the beginning of the film to the end. Look, I do not need a 10-page letter or a uppercase letter that explains a conspiracy to me. But the dark floors take "What is this movie about?" Something for a new level (annoying). What is this film about? <br /> <br /> This is not exceptionally scary or scary, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to finally feel frustrated and confused, hire this winner.
