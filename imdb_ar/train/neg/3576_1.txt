Even when I saw this movie in my teens, I wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadura starred in a film about an artist growing her way to the top. Beautiful and exciting like Mrs. Zadora, so she could not prevent the excuse of this film from the film. She could not even take pictures of her for Penthouse, where "The Lonely Lady" was "promoted back in the day" to prevent this movie from landing. The only thing that could save this film? Text is completely different. Give this one a miss.
