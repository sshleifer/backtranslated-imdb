This is the worst movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this movie !!! <br /> <br /> I never mean !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies "B". As you imagine .... I have been exposed to some of the worst things the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> This movie has attracted its title. I mean, come on ... what is the true fan of the unabashed terror like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? Photos of the "undead" fighting each other to "death" danced in my head. I thought of myself ... "This is a must see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... sorry to say .... "I wish I had not seen" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading at the very least. There were no vampires fighting the zombie. In fact, there is no conspiracy! If you want to ask me what is all about this movie, I can honestly tell you that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no conspiracy !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie is meaningless at all !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this disaster ... I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls whose money invested money in this project because they certainly have no commercial meaning !!!
