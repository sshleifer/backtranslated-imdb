Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly meet any representative challenge they face. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Watch the Detectives (2007)" offers only one for both actors and audiences: Do not fall asleep during a mindless, boring, and unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> "Watching the detective (2007)" is trying to be very funny, but the comedy is forced and directed in a very, very embarrassing and almost ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> After a third of the film, there is still something that can capture even the most willing audience, like the friends of the director and his relatives, let alone that, let alone actually happen. <br /> <br /> I'm quite sure that everyone who loved her was faked or forced to rig it, as did Neil's former girlfriend when he showed her an old film about B & W that she did not care much about. "Watching the detective (2007)" is not close to category "B", it is somewhere between questions and answers, such as - questions? And - repeat questions! The director knows what to do! Well, if his goal was to carry the viewer to death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> "Watching the Investigators (2007)" was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Kylian Murphy, bur Please do not let this waste your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
