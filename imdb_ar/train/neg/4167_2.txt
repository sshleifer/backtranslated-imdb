I was keen to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, though, was a nap of 1-1 / 2 hours. The premise seemed interesting: Porinaz is Lance Valentin, owner of a company called Mr. Fix It, where the dumped men recruit his help to get their girlfriends back. <br /> <br /> One of the problems facing this film is editing, script, and acting. Although I found Boreanaz enjoyable in his other cinematic roles (except for his "Crow"), it was disappointing. Sometimes, his personality was interesting and others, flat. The support team reminded me of the soap opera day players. I realized it was not a big budget movie, but some of the videos and music did not appear to be true. <br /> <br /> My advice: See at your own risk.
