Nicholas Rogge? The classic supernatural thriller does not seem right now? Strangely enough, the film was aired on the BBC television on the weekend, which was shown tonight to COLD HEAVEN and is not favored at all. <br /> <br /> You see it is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DOO`T LOOK NOW because they both have the same output and same structure, and for the first third of HEAVEN COLD the same plot except for the dead pair has been replaced instead of a dead child , In fact my mind was round about this film about a grieving widow and seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red sweater. This does not happen but about a third of the way during the run time there is a huge plot distortion and despite being a basic plot distortion, it was not explained in any great depth. In fact, very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN that destroys the film <br /> <br /> People have mentioned very low production values ​​for COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible to keep them out. If I were not different, I thought that this was TVM because it made the TV feel it down to the white letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to pump art claims into the home through spoken thought processes, but again this film does not help at all. One can not help feeling that Rogge should have done his best to move the conspiracies that are perfectly flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> The cheap production values, the uninterested direction, the strange premise and the bad film scenario
