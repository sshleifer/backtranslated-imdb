I liked "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy" I hope this is funny, but unfortunately it was not. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sportsman, Champ Kaind, who had confessed his love to Ron Burgundy in the car full of other members of the news team, was a joy. Everyone ignores him, louder and louder and finally accepts Burgundy, which is not recognized as well. But on the whole, the story is not affected. However, they are a noble attempt to save the unused pieces from the first film, including a complete plot about some potential local terrorists called "alarm clock". Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a number of funny lines, but this unused master chart has a good reason not to use it in the first film. The additions to this disc are very good. The best two films were the rehearsals that were shot with lots of improvisational comedy, and the fake commentary with Will Ferrell and the Exec Producer, discovered earlier by Ferrell, was not part of the film in any way Of shapes, shape or shape. He turned out to be "just a young man" walked through the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. They are some very funny things and last for 10 or 15 minutes
