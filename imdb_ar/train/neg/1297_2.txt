I took this film mainly because I saw a wonderful remake of Kitano Takashi for Zatouche and I was in the mood for another samurai story that was also starred as Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to her characters and vandalized the clich√© of the traditional Samurai movie. Gojoe runs from the deep end in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that contain other characters to inform the audience of a personal character rather than a personal development during the film. . "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in the presence of Benkei, but these internal disturbances barely move within the character itself. Instead of personal development, we see scenes of a bloated and boring battle. Asano's character is undeveloped and seems bored and does not know what to do there. I know it's usually far away and cool and forms part of Asano's attraction, but this film does not serve him. <br /> <br /> A lot of camera movement is exciting for nausea. There is a constant scene forever where the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I felt vomiting. The finish is silly and anti-climate. <br /> <br /> It's very bad not to make really good samurai movies in Japan these days using this kind of budget. The colors, landscapes and costumes were fantastic, but the rest is just a waste of time. It is best to see one of the Kabuki versions of this myth.
