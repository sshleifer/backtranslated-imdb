If there are some odd prizes for Oscar Academy, this click will win them all. He has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects along with very good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity star. Well, this may be the scenario if the world has been upset, but it is not. Instead, it's the worst horror bout ever, not just bad actors who seem to be reading texts from a remote control that has bad dyslexia, but also very low in special effects. For example, the devil costume (which by the way is a must), is one of the most fun things I have ever seen. Whenever I saw this black and red color called the monster on the screen I could not restrain my laughter. Moreover, it seemed as if the funny creature had been moved by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not do the same mistake as you did. Check out the IMDB's view that the movie was released in 2003 and had less than five voices and thought: "Well, it's worth filming, it can not be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, it can happen. /> <br /> I will not waste more words in this movie.
