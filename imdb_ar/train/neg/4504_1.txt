A slow, boring and one dimensional film! Good casting with a clich√© dialogue, a dull storyline, and a spiritless direction of Mr. Marshall! The traditional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent lacks the heart and new insights and depth. The lead character seems to be out of place because of its tiny, false-looking adhesive lenses. The lexicon used by the military appears to be somewhat confused and developed because of its limited exposure to education. The story goes on for hours trying to convince you that this small, dull and flat Asian girl is finally gisha, in fact they say in the film "she is destined to become a legend." The film is completely boring, it's beautiful to be seen, and it has many very exciting moments you might find out for cigars. Basically, if you do not believe the Apostle, you will not believe the letter, and this girl did not fill the shoe! Burin, boring, skip it!
