Oh yeah, Sakura Killers is a horrible terrible ninja movie, do not make a mistake. But it is also very enjoyable. Thanks in large measure to the wonderful presence of one Chuck Connors, who was described as a starring in the film, but only in a few scenes. I suppose it's supposed to be a kind of Obi Wan Kenobi ("The ninja-buster", where the copy of the box is reproduced) but his "wisdom" is funny. "Move without thinking" ?? My friend says that this is a sign of mental retardation, not the top focus. <br /> <br /> In fact, his aides, Sony and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that "Brooklyn," as the colonel calls it, tends to shine in comparison. Particular attention must be paid to Dennis's logic regarding the "genetic linkage" in which Sakura is involved. If you know anything about cloning you will die of laughter. And yes, this is a big conspiracy point, people. <br /> <br /> Sakura Killers is a hard-to-find jewel, a very fun movie. You will not spoil the "trick" that ends for you too, but it is the perfect set to fight Sakura Killers 2. Chuck Connors died very badly. :-( because he has the nicest way to blow up the ninja.
