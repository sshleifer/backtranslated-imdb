If you want to comment on movies where the script reaches the middle of the movie, this is the movie. Setting up and acting as in a porn movie but nothing happens except some groping and touch of type III. Which actually become very boring after 45 minutes of touch feeling but no action. A few of the actors I saw in movies with a real x rating, and their representation there was much better. All the special effects are done by the great "Rondo" who performs all the magic of his mind. A cult movie written on the box. Does this mean that this movie will not be seen at all ??
