Our teacher showed us this film in the first row. I have not seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this sound like a first class movie for you? I do not think so. I was terrified of this film, I can hardly see it. The scene was basically with Shirley McLean cutting that little girl in half, and then there was a boy with ketchup! I was terrified of this film. Today, after reaching 20 years, I probably will not feel this way. I just wanted to share my experience and my opinion that maybe young children should not see this movie, although it is PG. Be aware of the potential consequences of showing this to children. I do not even remember what it was, it was enough!
