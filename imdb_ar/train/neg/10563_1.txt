The time I spent watching this movie was wasting time. I do not hate science fiction. I do not reject any kind in itself, because good work can be done in any kind. This film, but not good work. I can not misrepresent the visuals (when it does not involve foreign makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story "BAD" was not comprehensive, about a hilarious comic book. But the Forex images were clearly where interest / attention / all manufacturers went. The alternating trend between slow and confused (no one was quite sure who was doing what to whom and to whom and at a crucial juncture at least). "Acting" was mostly too bad. There was no basis for most of the linear readings along with a hint of "it was so on the page and the manager told me that I was supposed to be crazy / sad / scared / whatever, well, so he was a pilot in the SF series. Correctable areas that should be considered necessary for the drama broker, I was amazed that the pilot sold the serial, or was the money also in the hands of the technerds?
