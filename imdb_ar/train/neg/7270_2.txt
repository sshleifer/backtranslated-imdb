This movie was given loooooooooooong "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read like a speed reader, you will never get a translation that tries to keep up with the Spanish talk! And hell going on in the plot if you can not read the translation. Staring endless and blind eye and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good film works but also some things that you think you think your screen has run out. How he won something I will never understand. It's hard to talk about "ACTING" because the key actors seem to just stare and look at each other lovingly when they do not push each other away. Geraldo's character is so attractive that it is hard to believe that anyone will push him away. What is with his mother? I just did not get it most of the time except that there were three young people who seemed to all have history with each other .... but did not find out who was the "former".
