Look at the poor Robert Weber (the wonderful performance, again!) Who is trying to wrestle with machine guns from a terrorist. Everything in this movie seems a bit wrong. The biggest mistake, in my opinion, is the effort to give the event a fixed standing in the early 1980s (the main difference between this jerk and the quieter, ironic, and therefore timeless death). The story comes through a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when commandos yell ?? "All the good men do it and all the bad guys do not do it so they can blow Lib (with a living conscience) so that the gas does not sink into the main character. I do not mind criticizing the Slavic movement as a shield for the bad guys and arguments between pacifist peace activists and peace activists, even those who preside over it. This is a film, but the political commentary is lame and uninspiring, which is unfortunate because the film presents a performance Bakra for Judy Davis, she plays a major fanatic and seems to have conducted extensive studies on the subject. " In any case, their performance is higher than the performance of others, and somehow feel that the film failed.
