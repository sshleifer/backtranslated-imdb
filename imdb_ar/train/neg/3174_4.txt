Jeff Lowell wrote the film "More Than Her Dead Body" badly. The idea first of all, is as old as jokes and just implementing cherries on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker There is hardly anything attractive in this film. Eva looks wonderful and ever offers a loving performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rod seems winding and less interested. Lake Bill is a complete miscast. It looks masculine and provides a mediocre performance accurately. Jason Biggs, as well as Lindsay Sloan. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I did not get entertainment.
