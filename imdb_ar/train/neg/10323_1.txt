I was excited to watch a sitcom that would represent Indian Indians, but I found that this show is not funny at all. Producers and actors are likely to be happy to get back both bad and good comments because it's about it! I was ready for some stereotypes and I have no problem with it because the stereotypes exist for some reason and are usually correct. But in fact there was nothing funny about these stereotypes. Dad is "fresh from the boat", which does not understand his daughter. (Who by the way is a terrible actress), and the modern Indian young man who tries to manage his politically correct mosque as much as he can (he is a very good actor, and I see him only getting better). <br /> <br /> It's too crisp and the dialog box does not flow well. There was great potential for something like this but unfortunately I think it failed, I do not really care to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed watching great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always a treat and natural in everything she does, so bad her daughter at the show does not have the same acting abilities!
