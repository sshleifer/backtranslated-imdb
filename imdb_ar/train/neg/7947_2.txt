When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary film. Apparently, not. I have no idea how to allow this movie to be shown on this site. FearNet is a site that displays scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is great from all actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie begins with a man with a scroll with a stamped mark. The seal breaks and some disasters occur. Water turns to blood, oceans die, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Lots of things that were not logical. Such as when you see a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, it is the date when her child is expected to give birth and start to wonder about him and begin to look at him and ask religious people what all this means. The worst thing about this film is the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God ordered him to kill his parents and the end of Demi Moore's death after the birth of her baby and the transfer of her soul. <br /> <br /> Here's what happens. A mentally retarded person is shot and killed and begins the end of the world. Demi Moore enters the hospital amid a massive earthquake and gives birth to her baby. She touches her baby's head and moves her spirit to the child and then dies. Then, the end of the world will stop. <br /> <br /> Why does the heart of God suddenly change? Feeling angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, then all about forgiveness once a single woman moves her soul to her child? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is too stupid. It's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. Representation of Demi Moore and Michael Payne and everyone is excellent. Thats all about it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie two stars out of 10. Acting well with a lot of nonsense!
