I understand I'm reviewing the movie I saw. I almost realized that all the lame and paper had been cut off from this film, which completely neutralized it. When I saw names like Ginger Lin and Jenna Jameson attached, I knew I would not get a classic horror film, but at least I was expecting boobies and undue bloodshed. But no, it should be the most terrifying film, but I mean it's easy to know that there are a lot for certain scenes, but it suddenly stopped, or the scene ends completely exactly when it starts. How can one screw cannibals and porn stars? I mean this is a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the manager sleeps with the wife of some executives or anything else, because it's literally amazing how much of this has been done. When I read about him a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it seemed like a fun movie, but unfortunately, the real movie is locked in a cellar somewhere, and we have to carry this stool called Evil Breed. Hopefully an unclassified clip will be released someday, so I think there's a good movie in this mess, but even then you can get twelve packs of Bud, because that's the only way you'll make it through this movie.
