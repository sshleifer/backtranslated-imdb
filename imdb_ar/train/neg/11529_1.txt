Yes, unfortunately, I came across a DVD of this and found it was incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some hooligans in an orange hat calling themselves "Orange Sherbert" is the best creative idea these people can make for a character, they should not be in the filmmaking scene. "Fashion" is weak, "bad" interviews, and basically there is no one "wrestler" on this disc with any full pieces of charisma. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling" in the Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and comically bouncing together on a trampoline. They make sure to laugh together all the time, too, which makes the experience look more like playing time for young children than a "wrestling death". <br /> <br /> Basically, the Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a clone of Backyard Wrestling. Just, instead of Blood, Arms, Chaos, and WRESTLING, we get trampoline, kids laughing, TERRIBLE VOICE, and a person named Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> A wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. terrible.
