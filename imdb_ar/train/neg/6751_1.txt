My friend and I hired this because we thought it might be a good distraction for Halloween. Assassin terrorizes young, white mask ... You get drifting. We were wrong! Intent is not intended. We have not only discovered one of the worst films there, but it is also a classic cult! The w / plots are filled with holes and has no meaning. The actress plays a pretty physical role, but that's it. I give credit for launching it on a very low budget - I always support such films. This is not a particular film. <br /> <br /> This movie may be good to see if you are drunk or high; otherwise do not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges as you did!
