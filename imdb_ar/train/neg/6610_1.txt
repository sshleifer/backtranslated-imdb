This movie should not be seen because it was supposed to be flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this new version of Bollywood classic film "Cholay", but after encountering problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... I think leave all the good parts of the film (acting, screenplay, songs, music, , Motion, etc.) and filming just because it actually happens to hire a crew. A waste of money, a waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he pulled a Godfather on us; what were you thinking of RGV? In any case, the story, though difficult to follow, is very similar to the old Schully. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, a new kid in the block playing Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad and funny" friends help a policeman catch a bad guy first. Later in the film, the retired policeman now employs them as personal security and is protected from the hands of the most sought-after artists who played Amitabh Bachchan. If you do not see Bollywood movies, Good Good wins in the end. There I will only save you 3 precious hours of your life!
