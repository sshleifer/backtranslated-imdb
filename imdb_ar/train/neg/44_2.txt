I'm not sure if you refer to those who described this video as bad or the director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly a strange horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mix of geese from superior films such as "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". The chick is kidnapped in the "jungle" by the "tribe" of "barbarism". The forest looks like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who wander in Halloween fashion hides like the city party of tribal clothing. The barbarians range from white to Asian to black to Latin. I suppose Franco just grabbed everyone who looked a bit sweaty to this racquet. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this film has a very small gorge, not too scary and an unnecessary rod. Not funny. I can find something I like about any Italian movie or euro trash. This one just fell short WAY. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
