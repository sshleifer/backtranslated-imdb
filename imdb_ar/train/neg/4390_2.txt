The TV guide described the plot as intertwined relationships as follows: "Experience on a broken arm explode" Instantly I thought this would be around his arm`s own mind as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS OR HAND OR ANYONE GETTING AN ARM GROWING Body parts. Both buildings are tested and tested, or I am more tired and tested, so I was interested in how the producers dealt with the story. In fact, they thought they were making a musical film like PI to use B & W photography at the beginning of the film, but it seems that filmmakers got tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to produce a similar comedy like THE EVIL DEAD. I'm not saying anything about this but I hated EVIL DEAD movies and hated the interrelationships. It seems really unfair that such films use an obscene amount of rubber when the Third World screams for condoms.
