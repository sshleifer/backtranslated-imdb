An Italian horror film about a wealthy English prince wandering around bars and pubs for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife, Evelyn. You know he must really love his wife, because he takes them home - a huge rotten castle - and makes them flounder and then torture them, flog them and kill them. The most unusual aspect of this film for me was that at the end of the film, we see this man played by Antonio de Tevi as the hero of the film. However, soon, on the advice of his uncle Blaio Roberto Maldera, De Tevi settles with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves and turns strange things into De Teffe's fragile state of mind. Begins to see and hear his dead wife, and finally, see to the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Aunt Agatha (apparently a little smaller than de Tif, with a wheelchair and trying to look old) faces her fate in a wry way. Another man is injected and buried alive. Of course, there is a full explanation of why Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Mericlia does some things fairly well: the settings in the film are perfectly suited to this film, despite trying to make us think England is funny at best. None of the actors look English. Many people with dark black hair and Mediterranean clothing are dressed, no English man will be arrested. Cars are on the wrong side of the road. But in spite of all this, the scene of the cellar was portrayed effectively and impressed by the cowardly decision as well. Of course, any film with Red Blake Erika Blanky is always an added bonus. There is a series of sexual perversion. However, it has been found to be somewhat appalling that the torture of women was good and perfectly healthy in order to alleviate one of his mental demons. Come on.
