You could say first of all, I felt strongly about this film so much that I registered in IMDb specifically for review. And my evaluation? This easily is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film's summary seemed interesting - the Nazis, the Saharans, time travel, etc., but the film plot failed to gather all these elements correctly. Remember the South Park episode that featured the Sea Leaves writing a Guy family using "idea balls"? Did these sheep also write holiness? The writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to tie them all together, and then to make things less logical, including the theme of the travel of time to Donny Darko-Essquer to the end, and the mixing of chronology. <br /> <br /> I can say early on that this movie was bad. The special effects were very low budget for anything better than direct to DVD. The acting was not great, but in fairness I saw what was worse. I would applaud the Nazi paintings, it was creepy, but the evil Nazi butcher man was just a comedian. <br /> <br /> I have no vengeance against this movie or anything, but frankly, I'm not even in this kind of horror. But this film can not be described as a dramatic or dramatic film. If this story is well written, it will be a good film. But it was over. Waaaaay over overed.
