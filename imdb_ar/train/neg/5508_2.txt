Tim (Gary Daniels) wants to storm serious television reports. When a job explodes he pleads with her, he is separated. His beautiful empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says Sayonara, too. Upon returning home, Tim was amazed to discover his house which has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) of Mars! Tim is called Uncle Martin, Tim is soon trying to help his new friend navigate the life on earth. However, Martin faces a problem wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to spend time with Tim but the true love path does not go in this case either. Soon everyone is chasing TV on Tim, hoping to get a story about a real alien. What is a man to do? For those who loved the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Weston, this film is not worth linking to homeopathic footwear. It is really very bad and undeniable, without any conspiracy and relying on the supposed special effects that fall too. Daniels is fine as a son of the earth, but Lloyd is simply as terrible as a foreigner, who is in a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as well as fashion, set, and production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to take another click at the video store. Be assured, children and adults will find this film a great embodiment, so choose "Night in the Museum" or "Around the World" in 80 days instead.
