The making of this film must have been done as a joke. I mean, it was the dumbest movie I think I've ever seen !! A snowman kills a small town? Give me a break. I love her when he pulls off the police car. More like a comedy than a horror film. If you want to laugh, rent this. If you really want a horror film, keep the hell away from this movie !!
