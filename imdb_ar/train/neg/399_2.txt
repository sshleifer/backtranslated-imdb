This picture began with good intentions, Bacon flagged out to test the theory of concealment, and Shu is as gentle as usual in its role. Everything breaks down after that, it's your usual Hollywood movie now, filmed on stage with special effects and abundance, minus any kind of humor, wit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get a soundtrack with John DeLancie as an invisible man instead, starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and good service was offered to HG Wells, unlike this mess.
