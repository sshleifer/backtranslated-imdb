The worst film on earth. I do not know where to start, but I hope I can save someone else from punishing this film. When it comes to acting and lighting, this film is like bad porn without having sex. The actors are the worst I have ever seen, and they could not have been worse even if they were trying to make a full mockery of this film. The film must have a low standard budget, and I'm sure it's almost lost on the cover of the film. This movie has now become an ongoing joke with my friends and has become a benchmark for comparing other trash movies. I would like to point out that there is no other film until the comparison begins. I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend of mine and watching this movie, and I am surprised that she still considers me a friend after the torment she has put into it. Do not see this movie!
