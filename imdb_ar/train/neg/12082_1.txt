Unfortunately, poor hamlet. I knew him dear reader, let me tell you, this copy sucks! I do not know of all the people who have raised funds for this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic play and turned it into a more boring melodrama imaginable. This version is very, very literally too bad, so you can not save it until there is a great person like Maximilian Schell in a starring role. The quality of this movie's only recovery is that it made a great fodder for "MST3K"; Mike and Servo and Crow enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> But in both cases, I'm sure that Shakespeare, if he was alive when they did, would not want his name to be associated with that. This "Hamlet" is not so bad, it's good; it's just plain bad. Absolutely awesome.
