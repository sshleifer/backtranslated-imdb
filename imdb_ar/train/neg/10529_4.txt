First seen 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): A disappointing musical play from the point of view of personality development, in my opinion, of this piece Rodgers and Hammerstein received by many. There are a few good songs and a decent comedy, sometimes, of Siam's director by Jules Brenner - but the film does not do a good job in presenting the position and settings. I can only blame the script and perhaps some behaviors that make us not fully understand their personality and their situations. I know it may be a bit of a question about a musical song dedicated to enjoying songs and dancing, but even that part did not show much for me. The basic story revolves around an English woman coming to Siam to teach children European things upscale. We later discover that the king is actually the greatest pupil. There is a forbidden love story between the latest wife of the king, played by Rita Moreno (Latin as an Arab - come on !!) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really added. Deborah Kerr, as the main female figure Annie, is fine, but that is not convincing either. The king learns some things because of their presence and then the film fades as it does. It's really a small story with some songs and dancing, but it's not really a great experience for the viewer.
