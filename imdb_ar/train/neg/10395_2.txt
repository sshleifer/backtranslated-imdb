It is impossible to understand what horrific producers have done to this appalling adjustment. <br /> <br /> A group of high-quality actors, in the good main entrance (with two notable exceptions), who offer good performances. Penelope Keith is ideal as Aunt Louise and Joanna Lumley as Diana. Everything is fine with the texts that I gave them. <br /> <br /> Much for good. The average will include groups. Nancherrow does not look like the house described in the book, although the house they use at Dower House seems odd. So obviously the Dower House is too big. In subsequent sections, the book decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although I have no doubt that they can re-establish Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad. Scenario. Such a horribly bad adjustment is difficult to find from words to condemn. Edward does not die in the Battle of Britain but he survives and is blind. He makes a short appearance and then commits suicide - why? Loveday has transformed from the young woman she completely loves with Gus to the wife of a sensible farmer who can give up the love of her life barely torn (less emotional than a brief encounter). Joss, a besieged man with a passion for love, is willing to give up his love without complaint. Walter (the mud in the book) moves from a disloyal, shallow husband to a loyal family man. Jess turned into a young woman suffering from mental disorders and would not talk. Aunt Bidi still suffers from a drink problem but now without any justification. The army occupies the house of Dower House for no apparent reason but a very short scene with Jess who fears armed soldiers. While Ms Mortimer's mammals are quite cheerful, I could not see how her presentation on several occasions had moved the plot forward. It becomes delightfully named Nettlebed mundane Dobson. The maximum number of words prevents me from continuing the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence (I have lost all interest in seeing it after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes have been made to create the follow-up story. It is hard to imagine that Rosamonde Belcher would have accepted this bizarre deviation in her book; presumably she lost control when the rights were acquired.
