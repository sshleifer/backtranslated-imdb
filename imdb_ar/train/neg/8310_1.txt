Another conspiracy film tries to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the military) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has spent time in the US military can see how false this film is. Uniforms, equipment, collections and behaviors are all wrong. (Of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or stupid ones.) Stark propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted over the last few years. Uses all the cliches, rumors, and urban legend of the Gulf - all presented as a gospel. (The truth is that no one knows for sure why some veterinarians in GW have contracted the disease while others have good health as horses) War is not fun I know that veterinarians in World War II, Korea and Viet Nam suffer from some very serious diseases. (It is the responsibility of the government to take care of all of them.) Thrilling movies like this will not solve the problem!
