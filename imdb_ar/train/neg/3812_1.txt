Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so disturbing that it is impossible to bear them. The best character is Joey so it is sometimes irritating. And in that DJ girl who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time you talk. Not to mention when Danny begins his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won about $ 10,000 or more in the casino. However, she is not eighteen so she must not gamble according to the law. She is willing to pay her money, but then, Danny, her father is the one who took her and does not allow her to collect these money because she is not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, will you? Since I saw that stupid and small scene that immediately shut him down on television. Some thing they say in this series was not even the baby buys it. Who thinks in the world that Ful House is amusing and funny? Every word he says in this series looks like Shakespeare wrote it.Except that Shakespeare knew how to write otherwise it would not be that silly and stupid to write something stupid as they wrote in the script for the whole house! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world, strongly recommend "Do not see Full House"! Loop as an experiment. Avoid this series. Save yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! Best watch Teletubbies then this. "I do not see this."
