I think the show had a very good concept to work with. But the execution was bad. The script is poor and the representation is bad. There were many issues that could have been better photographed, such as protesting gay marriage or finding a cemetery. The presentation can not be properly described as a comedy show because it lacks humor. I must say that this offer was hardly successful in putting the life of the Muslim community to some extent. I had high hopes for this exhibition, but I was disappointed. I still appreciate CBC for putting such a concept in front of viewers. Anyway I wish good luck for the future.
