<br /> <br /> This film looks ugly and ugly, so it does not seem to entertain children in the audience, except for a fairly amusing toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd has skipped his career and has been very tired in this role, although the unfortunate excuse for jokes by the book does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is an embarrassing amateur in a supposed comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darrell Hannah are insulting. There is really no reason to make this film, especially as it is inevitable to compare it to the wonderful brilliant renditions of Robin Williams at Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
