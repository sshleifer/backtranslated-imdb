I am a fan of Ludlow's work, wrote one secret and often thought about how much they could join a movie. Imagine my enthusiasm, then, when I knew that such a movie already exists! The "Abyss Factor" seemed to be the first in the series a clear place to begin. <br /> <br /> The film was disappointing from the start. Simple elements of the film such as the first encounter with Griffin Smith are unnecessarily different from the book, and less exhilarating. There are several characters cast badly too. For starters, the Dorf is as sad as Smith. Not a bad actor, it's just a very bad choice because it's too weak, and fails to show many of John Smith's specific features. <br /> <br /> Renaming, renaming, and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. For example, removing Victor Tremont and the full background of the virus, including VAXHAM's involvement, makes the whole point in the film somewhat hazy. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and it differs considerably in the seat from the back seat (not to mention that the character of the film does not share anything with the character in the book) Another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russell is supposed to be Randy Russell. Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Messengers (Sophia Russell should be called) but is also supposed to work from the CIA, not a "secret one". Which brings me to my last point, and I think it is one of the most important points. The first coverage does not exist even at this stage! Not only is the second book of this series, which was developed by the president as a precaution against further bioterrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I can continue all day long. In short - if you love books and want to see a good adjustment, I'm afraid you will be very disappointed. Even though it is an action film, it is quite average, mainly due to lack of editing and bad effects. The faulty story line and the boring text in the ditch are the last nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.
