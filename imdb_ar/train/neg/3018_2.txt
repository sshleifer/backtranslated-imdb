What will you get when you mix a block of cliches with a slow speed and a bunch of characters you do not care about and a failed attempt to create an appealing visual style and a larger block of cliches and a humorous spirit of humor and a really big budget? Why, you can get one of the most unbearable movies ever! I mean, of course, Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people might say while playing this movie: <br /> <br /> "Oh, wow, the narrative is telling me that it has not happened a billion times, more skillfully than this movie . "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the bright lights and the touch of the lovable movie. "The director tries hard to make things look extreme and create a visual style! It's very bad that none of these effects adds anything to the movie or Be logical with the scenes in it, and it's very bad that most of them are caught up in anger! "<br /> <br />" I heard this exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" I have seen this scene in ho I have thirty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" This one too! "<br /> <br />" Ah, have not they revealed this "evolution of the plan" about half an hour ago? Surprise? "<br /> <br /> If this movie is supposed to show" tough chick "revolves around kicking ... when do not do much of it?" <br /> <br /> "I can not I believe how abnormal this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long does this thing feel like I've been watching it for more than four hours already? "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but also, I do not feel particularly motivated to try to figure it out. "<br /> <br /> Is this over yet? "<br /> <br />" I want to recover my money. "<br /> <br />" The songs in this track feel very evening here. "Paradoxically, all the curses they use actually diminish their impact. "<br /> <br />" UGH. <br /> <br /> Finally, "I have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this film to me." <br /> <br /> In short, this film is a failure in almost every aspect. If your house is in flames and this movie plays in the only non-flammable room, you should seriously consider being burned. <br /> <br /> (If it seems bitterness, this is because I've just spent more than two hours watching this movie, and I I did not enjoy it very much.)
