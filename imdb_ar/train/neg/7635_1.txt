I fully agree with the review by one of Variety's critics that the film has never been funny, vital or intelligent about the creative process, since its hypothesis seems necessary. My narrative is messy and lighting is really a problem. If the film is supposed to be character-driven, poor lighting does not improve representation and it is sometimes difficult to observe actors' facial expressions. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty following the English language spoken in the film and will lose some local humor in the process. She watched the film at the Cape Town World Film Festival last year. Feedback and feedback on the film ranged from junk and dirty to the welcome departure of films about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be mentioned as one of the bright lights of the new wave in South Africa, but some great films about the history of our apartheid system will indeed be rated among our best films in the history of our 110-year-old film. Not surprisingly, the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after it was released and from most cinemas in Durban and GÃ¶tting. It is clear that he had limited appeal among the masses in South Africa.
