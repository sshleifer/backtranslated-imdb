Just imagine that the real Hitler, who was the master of publicity and speech, was an obscure handicap as Carlyle portrayed it in this film. <br /> <br /> No one, not even a desperate, unemployed young man in the twenties of the twentieth century followed him. <br /> <br /> This is just a cardboard piece of Hollywood of the same propaganda, disguised as a "real history". <br /> <br /> I pity everyone who believes anything in this show. Carlyle and the producers did not get anything. <br /> <br /> Why could Hitler have won many people, a complete boycott of his ideas if we were such sausages? Why do people follow him to death? By portraying him as a loser, they make their own film incredibly incredibly. This film is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill, which the director only shows as a 90-minute star. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disgrace, and I wonder how they can talk to a representative like Carlyle in this smashing.
