When you listen to the joy of this movie, I finally hired it in the video store, and maybe I laughed 3 times for 75 minutes. This film <br /> <br />, a collection of comics that mocks TV is a mess. <br /> <br /> Inconsistent. Jokes have faded, humor has dealt with issues since the 1970s and are no longer relevant, and jokes continue for a long time (as with the new SNL) /> <br /> the last few years). Unnamed: Yeah, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe for everyone <br /> <br /> about one minute or two. I liked the fact that this was very hard <br /> <br /> and it had a lot of nudity but it was not funny? Do <br /> <br /> For yourself, hire and rent a fried Kentucky movie that promises to be a great movie. <br /> <br />
