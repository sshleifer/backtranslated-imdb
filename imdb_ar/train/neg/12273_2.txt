PLAN B has a fast-changing and undefeated film appearance for a movie with a stroll to the actors involved - a stroll that was supposed to be narrowed from the start. It is just another "comedy" based on the Mafia and contains nothing new and reduces the level of participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloney (Paul Sorfino) is a crime director who cares about clothes and appearances more than his interest in his work of control. His assistant Mario (Anthony Desando) is dirtier than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloney beat one of his debtors (who happened to be married to Fran-Diane Keaton) and Maloney takes Fran as his assistant to work to get rid of her dead husband's debt by being Maloney's "bad guy". Fran is afraid of her own shadow, unable to do Maloney's tasks, and instead chooses to move her "newcomers" to Florida to hide in her brother James' home so she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to kill the three candidates called Plan B, Plan A is being killed! The end is quite predictable as with each line assigned in the characters script. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made a lot of beautiful films and is one of the most talented actresses and comedians, but she screams here and barks and convulsions her way through an ironic part that becomes annoying to watch quickly. Paul Sorvino is, well, Paul Sorvino kind of cast of other mob films. Supporting actors are also allowed to play on the terrace in the widest possible manner. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just ridiculous and overpriced. Director Greg Letanis needs a return to the comic television series: if this imaginary story was pressed into a half-hour gig, he might have had a chance. Grady harp
