I've seen some bad films (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible, but it's so boring that I barely passed and could not bear to see the rest. Compassion. With a talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz, Robert Duvall and John Gresham's story, what's wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer who has one night with Davitz. Her father (Duval) is mentally unstable hanging her cat, etc., and so, Brange sent him to a factory, and fled immediately. Somehow (I could not figure out how) Robert Downey Jr. and Darrell Hannah and Pameck Jansen and Tom Beringer were mixed in a story that moves slower than static. I wanted to like this, and as a Grisham fan, I read everything about this film and I expected something interesting. This is frankly the worst film I've ever seen and I wish I could recover my money. * Away from the place *****.
