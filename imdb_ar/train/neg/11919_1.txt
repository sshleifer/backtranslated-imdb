This should be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991, it looked great. Since then I've always wanted to see it but I never found it ... ..until today, yes, after 14 years. <br /> <br /> Let's just say I was very disappointed because it was unrealistic. Well, I knew he would not be an Oscar winner, but I still hope it would be fun to have an irrational film in the foot of the blood. Unfortunately, that was not the case, it is boo <br /> <br /> With all the American rock and roll the acting was so bad and it was very scary. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were nonsense and had a fantastic appearance. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me only £ 5 and I think it was £ 7. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I will never get that hour back half.
