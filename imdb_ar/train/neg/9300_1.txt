Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst film ever. Perhaps in Ed Wood's style (without the heart). Lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgue ... Come on!). Acting ... Well, there is no representation! <br /> <br /> There is someone who actually goes to look for his lost wife and takes time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat clown and unscientific and could not outshine a turtle! <br /> <br /> All the crew members are stupid and the director puts all the cliches from slashers in the movie effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The end is the most stupid at all. Think about it: the person who has the skill of acting is the same in his writing (he is the mind behind this flop) and calls a colleague and two of his friends to the weekend and kills them. On Monday morning, back to the office as if nothing was happening. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Herbert is trying to make us believe that it is a family affair that goes to Gil (his uncle is the killer clown). <br /> <br /> Of course, he will not be questioned by the police after his colleague disappears. .. <br /> <br /> Whatever. <br /> <br />
