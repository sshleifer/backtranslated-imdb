*** Warning! Vandals containing content here! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-biography of what could happen to Madonna if stranded on an abandoned island. There is no challenge to Madonna in this role, and this is clear. It's just Madonna playing Madonna, she can not even get it right. I know what you're saying, you say, "How do you know what Madonna really looks like, you've never met her!" True, I did not do that, but we all remember "truth or audacity", right? I know Kevin Costner does it. <br /> <br /> You might think, in 2002, that Madonna might have learned something, in one way or another, from the "cross" ladies who made their way through the silver screen. For good, did Madonna not see "glamor"? Mariah Carey has shown how the world movie is done !!! Maria throws Madonna's butt full of vitality into beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, whatever you like! All we see from this view of Madonna is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing that can be said about Madonna, it is that they are consistent. When she was my lover MTV, she brought the female fashion world back 20 years. Now, in the film, the roles of women in cinema and society are back 20 years, by taking a look at all the most hated, horrific, disgraceful, and abhorrent qualities of women who have been closed inside, qualities they try so hard to prove they really do not have . <br /> <br /> *** Here the saboteurs !!! Do not read anything else if you do not want to know ... *** <br /> <br /> Here's the only good thing I'll say about this film, and I really liked it. They did not go to the "end of Hollywood" - Madonna's personal life. At the end of the happy Hollywood model, Madonna's character was dead on the island, and her husband, who was suffering from persecution and persecution, was free to finally settle down with a respectable good woman, a woman who would be just the opposite. Of his deceased wife, both of whom live happily ever after. But in this very frustrating conclusion, she is saved, and once again, this poor victim of the husband is again exhausted by his wife's demon, and his life will once again be a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** Here the vandals end ***
