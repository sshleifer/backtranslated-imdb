I have always been passionate about the drama of the period, a form of art that the BBC has always enjoyed in the past. This Byron presentation was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was awful, and was acting without inspiration, and all the characters were sadly confused. Byron seems to have been "a bad and dangerous madness to know" and put the hearts of the ladies on the flap. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a small friend who jumped to the top instead of the fiery champion of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked awkwardly. This picture of a man was lame everywhere. <br /> <br /> I have seen two and a half hours waiting for something to appear in life. No clamor, not even a glimmer. It was full boredom, if not full boredom, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> After seeing that no one will ever improve "cool Avon", I also believe that Byron felt very exaggerated and that my mind should be placed on the back burner, and this dramatic representation should be treated with the same treatment life. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its influence in this regard.
