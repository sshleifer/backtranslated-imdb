Usually I'm not the kind of horror movies I've feared, but this movie is the exception. How did this film reach my mind !!! It is a very simple film but at the same time very effective, it enjoys a wonderful atmosphere, and this leads to some horrific moments, the father of the girl who descends to the hill is a real place. Last seen was the picture of the family that I did not expect and jumped from my seat !!! I recommend everyone watching this movie, with the lights out will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
