Make your own mind. I personally found it more fun than receiving a spinal click from Stevie Wonder. No crime Mr. Ajab. Maybe it's a comedy, but I found it stupid. Not exactly the first two options for babysit your kids. Wheeler (Sean William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two drinkers, were ordered to avoid serving jail terms by ordering the court to instruct two children from a development center run by Gael Sweeney (Jane Lynch). One of the good guys is Rooney (Bob J. Thompson), a foul fifth-grade student and the other is Ogi (Christopher Mintz Plus), a young flop who plays a role in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to charge them with an invaluable inner vision of life, love and heavy metals. Lynn Farhan with her dry wit analogues. Support: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Gyong, Kerry Kenny Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Winn.
