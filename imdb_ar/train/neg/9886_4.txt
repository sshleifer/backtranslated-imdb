This is Peter Volck's film. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already a veteran film at the time. Of course my parents did not watch this film when it was released, but I loved the character of its ads and the feeling that this was an important film. Well, 34 years later, I finally watched the film - after I had never seen any film directed by Cassavetes. It's a breakthrough, in general. Feeling zero timing, editing. Gina's performance reminds me of much of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man": technically equally, but with one remark. When Tom Cruise stole the Rain Man, Falk took the cake for the film. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed at the performance of Gina, all the time - seemed better suited to "waking up" (gently!) This is not all her fault: it is a basket case from the first scene to the last. We do not know why? But Falk's character looks real and is brilliantly executed by Falk as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> Shaved at least an hour (a wanted editor!), this was not a photo of a woman under the influence but of a simple man, Cro-Magnon, a man holding a wife not working and still unable to deal with her children Three and long working hours for her husband. <br /> <br /> D Remember to remember Cassavet about "Dirty Scores" or "Rosemary's Baby". It would have been a better way out if he had stopped his own tendency to overestimate - as clearly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
