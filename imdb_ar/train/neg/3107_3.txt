Woody Allen made "September", to prove that even the genius can disintegrate. This is Mel Brook's "September". Stupid, boring, and unusual, I must admit I did not see it until the end. The click is classified among the nondescript couple (for example, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that either brought me to sleep or forced me to get to the "Rewind" button. I say this, unfortunately, as a committed fan of Mel Brooks. He must stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. How the same colleague who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could unload such a dog is beyond me. Must be avoided at all costs.
