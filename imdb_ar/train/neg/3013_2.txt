Beginning with the long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the devastating impact of manufacturing on the natural environment and traditional societies. Its appalling narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. There may be no mention of the current Asian motivation for manufacturing, wealth and past experiences of hunger and terrorism. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an attempt to present portraits of Edward Bertinski about industrial waste in a "beautiful" way. A large part of the film is a slideshow of these images. They are produced well, from the size of the museum, and appear to have appeared in many exhibitions. For me, however, they just prove that it can make almost any image look beautiful if it is well displayed. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the images and the spoken message of the film remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to point out that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialization. The landscaping manufacturer, however, offers only a strange and bitter despair. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. It may have some value as evidence of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
