After seeing this myself, there are very few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a terrible film. Freaky in a way that is not fun, but it makes you smile with your teeth and a quiver. Makes you scream "This is a mistake" in the film. Immersion is zero. At the moment, you may be most familiar with the terrible mistakes / weirdness of movies that contain hackers for computers and so on. This film looks like this on every side. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is the little girl Emily, who played brilliantly Eliza Bennett. I hope to become great and make this .. something at least worth something. <br /> <br /> Offer yourself a service. You do not see this. There is not even proper work in it. Total time consuming.
