When I first saw this film in the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still believe that the output and film are excellent as well as the music. But in fact the text that started to bother me more and more. I find that Emma Thompson's writings are insipid and insincere to the original book; Marianne was reduced to a side character, a second violin for her too old, and an intense Elinor - many "focus moments" were given in the film, Thompson herself. <br /> <br /> I understand that she cuts off several characters from the book, but I leave the only scene in which Willoughby was recovered in the book? For someone red and dearest book long before the film, these are things that are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. You do not get the best scenario in the world to do it, but it still stays safe, without much emotion. Alan Rickman is wonderful, maybe a bit old, but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriguez, it's just as wonderful as ever.
