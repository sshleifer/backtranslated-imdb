I only recently saw the film, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertainment film, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is not compared to Azumi. "Princess" is not very talkative, you may have noticed ... reminded me of Jean-Claude Van Damme, who was only staring to clarify his point of view, then beat the bullshit of opponents. Throughout the film, I waited to hear at least acknowledgment of what you liked, why you were fighting, who you loved and trusted. I waited in vain. The Movie. The dialogue is crappy. Do not watch it unless you want to be bored of your mind! It is very bad, in the end I was wondering how I managed not to yell at frustration for 1 and a half hours. Approximately. I give 4/10.
