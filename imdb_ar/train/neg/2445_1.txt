Hello, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are a colleague in watching this movie: Join fanlub! The film was so incredibly bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must, it's bad in a nice way. You can see all the clich√©s created for horror film here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 films ever produced.
