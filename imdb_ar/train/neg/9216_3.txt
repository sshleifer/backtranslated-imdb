Hoo Boy, this was a real experience to get. The DVD tray contains Tom Hanks sweeper on it and that's the only reason anyone makes a purchase. He is looking for forty square, however, the film was produced in 1982, so he still has what the friends of Bossum do, and of course he weighs less than forty pounds. The plot involves fortified towers such as the dragon game played by Hanks and his three friends, and Hanks ends up thinking that it's all real. Chris Makepeace is a genius boy named Jay Jay and the best thing in the film is that he wears a series of funny hats. Oh, see, he has a rough yellow with a tuxedo! Now he is dressed as a World War I pilot! This was a really bad film but in a bad way. A handful of veterinarians pop up mostly as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm West Honey, damn!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who really look like hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaw, has a nagging roll to heal as a cop. Wendy Crosson, is the love interest of Hanks and some blond men who have not seen them before or since. There is some sweet music here and there and there is no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because, as you know, he breaks. The monster was played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, who is a Predator's fame. I got this friend out of the ol discount box at MallWart and advised me to put it in the trash without looking at it, so it was normal to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the box. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumped from one of the towers of the World Trade Center because of his illusions, he returned home to recover and was visited by his friends. Hanks' mother, drunk drunk Vera Miles, says he's coming well now, but when they go to the lake to visit him in tennis, he gets crazier than ever. End
