The film "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" consists mostly of badly rooted footage of a movie. The plot is meaningless, and various characters enter and emerge from the picture without explanation at all. When you see this silly parody, you will feel more than a lot of other comments that have been taken very accurately: it is easy to produce a cheap film and low quality then use the angle of "spoof" as an excuse for its license and low quality (in one scene, Tomatoes that float near them; to what extent can "to suspend kufr" to go - even in a parody?). Song title is wonderful, though. (* 1/2)
