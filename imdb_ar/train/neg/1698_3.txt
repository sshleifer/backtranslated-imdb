Lynch. The guy has some really great things! He knows how to annoy us, then rewards us by making us think in different ways. This, however, is quite different. Dumbland reward is 1% silly comedy, earned by carrying 99% of stupid. Maybe I laughed once, but somewhere around the 4 episode, I just started to watch quickly. Did not miss anything. I felt comfortable when it was over, and that's part of this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded off by annoying animations, sounds and voices. But the realization of this and its other absurd characteristics still fail to make Dumbland worthwhile.
