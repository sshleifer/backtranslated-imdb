I do not understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and wonderful at all levels and I can not understand how it was made at all. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound - Su's hideaway, alcoholic, white and Irish father are a bright example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, to her Asian friend at Su, but even then it turned out he was capable of domestic violence! Because they are not as attractive as they are both, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue threw himself on a prominent march like Bob - but given that, why should I expect to take care of what happens to them? Many reviews continue to talk about how "realistic" it is. If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society but there is no reason to put it in the film. <br /> <br /> I never liked the movie.
