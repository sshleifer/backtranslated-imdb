I hated this film. The original Phantasm had a wonderful ambiance and ambiguity. Like many of the 1970s horror films, he looked and felt like an incomplete creepy documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 1980s, increased effectiveness, but kept this beautiful interest in mood. Unfortunately, the third fantasy is just awful. He explains all the strange events in previous films, which reduces their power rather than expands it. It degrades images in a shameful way from the first Fantas like cheap reconstruction of the original. There are so many flying atmosphere in this film that it looks like a household pest more than a threat to celestial bodies. Hundreds hanging from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the draft. Did not anyone - the master of the pillar, the DP, the editor, or the director - notice that they were looking backward? Worse still, Phantasm III offers an unsettling, annoying joke. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Fantasian used humor to lessen his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to erect countless cheap jokes around Reggie's Century: many of them refer to "flying balls" in the ha-ha movie, Oh, I get them, balls. Maybe the crew got a kick from these jokes, but they are in us.
