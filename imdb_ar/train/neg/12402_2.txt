I've always thought people were a bit pessimistic about these old Andy Hardy movies. Two of them were not bad. The critics of modern cinema are not the ones who usually prefer to be nice, so two Judy films like this rarely get praise <br /> <br /> However, I can not defend this film either. You can still have a dated dialogue but you still laugh and cry over the story. By watching this, you just shake your head and ask yourself, "How can you get stupid?" This is more subtle than the slender, if you know what I mean. It's very boring and I can not understand how many people actually sit for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically Andy (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of the jam because he makes up a story about sharing with some novices from New York City as if that was the best. People were more socially aware in the old days. You may have heard the term "social climber" as if knowing the rich or the wealthy was the highest achievement you could achieve in life. All of this is completely nonsense, of course, and seems more so today. <br /> <br /> However, it is about an innocent and clean story and series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies) you might find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland sing, this is your ticket, she sings several songs here as she makes her way into Andy's heart. Man, I almost got rid of writing up about this!
