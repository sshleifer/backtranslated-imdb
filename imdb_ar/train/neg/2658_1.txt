Watching CBS "Surrender, Dorothy", I was wondering why Diane Keaton wanted to be (not because it was a television movie - with the rarity of the seductive roles of the slightly older actors, it's no wonder why she won the Academy Award. Does not provide any opportunities for Keaton to shine). The single mother, who is saddened by the sudden death of her 20-year-old daughter, is forced - and gradually becomes a friend of - a group of young people whose daughter was about to arrive at the time of her accident. This novelist, inspired by the novel, gives you a group of self-absorbed characters that one can cross the street to avoid. Apart from being rude and scared, these false people are unbelievably unconvinced, as in the sleek and baffled scenario near the beach where the children live (one young man in a muscular shirt tells us he is an idiot, says Diane Keaton, "Surrender, Dorothy "He asks in fact," This is from the "Wizard of Oz", is not it? "... No, genius, he is" citizen citizen "!). Keaton may have wanted to do this article on the subject of the face of death. She tries to transform this unwelcome woman into her own personal shadows (lots of kooky clothes), but she does not sit well with the viewer because Keaton has always been loved and flexible in a warm way. Here, she is a crazy guitar that does not learn a lot of lessons on her journey to self-discovery (the film quickly forgets that it revolves around a dead young woman and becomes a tragedy for a mother's nervous wreck, and seems too hippie to lose anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actor who promotes talk shows with warning, "Many sad mothers should help." I can not imagine it helps anyone because it's essentially falling, confused and perplexing. It's distorted.
