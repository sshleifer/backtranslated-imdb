Some spoilers are waiting. <br /> <br /> Why do people, when they feel frustrated, sick or scared in a club, break into the crowded dance hall on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in his right mind will hide under the bed when someone breaks into his room? <br /> <br /> How many times have you touched the door of a stranger, and when they do not answer immediately, you open the door, enter, scream, hello, and then start to pass their things? <br /> <br /> If you are being chased by someone you just discovered was a murderer, what would you do? Sneak quietly and hide under a wooden platform or between metal tools? Run, quietly of course, to a ratty old barn or other worn structure? <br /> <br /> I was talking about a movie that was released in the last few years, but since this is the "Return" page, it's clear that I'm talking about The Return. I saw it free because I work in a movie theater and I scan all the "scary" films. I think this one was acceptable ... apart from the worn cliches. Sarah Michelle Gillard is really awesome and looks kind of "huh?" Through most of the film. The details of the plot are presented slowly as the film progresses and is almost enough to make it interesting, but there was not enough illustration during its progression, so it was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the thriller thriller, it's worth watching at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie, I think it is worth a matin√©e ticket. If you think the trailer makes it look like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
