The Great Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This average puzzle "B" was one of only five films released in 1942 With Simon as director. Surely it could fit for another Red Skelton movie or two in its schedule! However, the Grand Central Murder is a rude ripping of Thin Man films minus intelligence, magic and chemistry in performances. We have dealt with a thin piece of paper that can barely support 73 minutes, misbehavior and tired of depression. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play together with Nick, Nora Char-er, Rocky and Butch Custer. It's PI, his wife and bad partner. They engage in "comic" jokes with each other. We see? It's quite different already. Hevelin is the only person who hints at bigger and better things, although he is close to being a terror in this. Virginia Gray was in another high man, but again, let me emphasize, that this film does not like one thing, no sir. Only if we begin to think that this film is not like any other film (for example, the tall man) that we would like to do, Sam Levin appears as the principal investigator who is grim and has to be directed precisely to Van Hevelin. All threads are important. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> And quickly, "murder" is the murder of the maddened planner Mida King, who likes to trade with wealthy men to find a richer trick. Patricia Dane, who resembles the C version of Hedy Lamarr, plays up her mouth and turns into F. There's a whole bunch of mysterious suspects, all motivated by their own because they want to kill Mida. There is a kind of community, tough talk names, bullying, former lover, and shady theater (Tom Conway, burdened here by the unlikely name of Frankie Cerro). Roman Bonin plays a nervous nervous strain, something I think he may have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop, in a running gag that will not stop, can not stop thinking about the piece of ass he is waiting for once this situation ends (that's right, Millard Mitchell, Swordsman). Finally, in a whole new way of storytelling, something we have never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in one place to tell their stories (in the form of past memories) to the detective, where Rocky takes mental notes, to the end a guilty person forced to explode confessions dramatic. <br /> <br /> On top of the actual image being aggressive, I naively thought that there might be footage of the actual Grand Site in the central 1942 era, but unfortunately, no. There is just one very short shot at first. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to sum up, the formula is a bit preliminary, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * من of 4
