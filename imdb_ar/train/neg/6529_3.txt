This film is funny and painful at the same time. "Cinematography" almost had a bout. Despite what it suggests, "Cinemagic" is not some innovative technical action. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and they used it because it ignores the fact that their "monsters" were stupid-looking. I also do not think it is a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is a good laugh if you're really looking for a 9-day movie for $ 200,000. It is amusing; at least I can say so about it. Bats / Mice / Spider is a highlight.
