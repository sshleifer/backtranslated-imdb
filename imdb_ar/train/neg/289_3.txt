What made the original Tomato Killer fun was by people who had no budget and who were just a fool for a few days ... <br /> <br /> It was a budget thing, but it was not as much fun. John Astin of the Adams family actually makes a comedy effort, but is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and exotic guises. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Jeangren (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides he will put a demonstrator on the throne of France ... The hero and his French girlfriend and the "fog of tomatoes" similar to the island decide they will stop ... <br /> <br /> Forget directly to the nonsense video .. .
