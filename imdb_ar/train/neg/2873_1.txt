This film features a brilliant brunette called Daniel Petty. She has amazing green eyes, she is in the first few scenes and the last scene. It is the only thing in this film that does not arouse hatred. She may not have a future as an actress, because this type of film is a kind of offensive disaster that kills jobs. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has nothing to recommend at all. It's not a good horror film, or a good fake report, or not a good distance. There is no clear skill in production. It is like a bad student film. The horrible elements of the story do not make you sick, it's a very bad fact that makes you sick. I would like to give this movie stars if I can not.
