A stupid dentist discovers that his wife was unfaithful. Therefore, no new storylines are here. However, the authors were able to create a disgusting stupid film. If you enjoy watching the children vomiting, or watching a dentist imagine that he is pulling all his wife's teeth in a bloody horror, go to (or rent) the movie. If not, go to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
