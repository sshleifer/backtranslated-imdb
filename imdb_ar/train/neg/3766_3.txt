I went to watch this movie knowing that it would not be great. But what I saw was awful for words. I do not mean to be cruel, the film was terrible. Overall it was bad, I mean the special effects AWFUL, it was not too bad acting, but it was not too good, and it was the same sasquatch like .... well, no sasquatch In my opinion, the best movie is Saskatchee Harry and Henderson. It's not violent or terrifying, but it has a better portrayal of sasquatch. At least her suit and not some cgi half-ass rip off. Watch this movie only if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the movie. Or going to see Saints Boondock, is much better.
