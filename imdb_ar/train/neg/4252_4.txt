*** Possible saboteurs *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this day, I had some expectations about how it would be, not too high, but not too low. That was not what I expected at all. It seems to me that the filmmakers have not been able to determine the type of film they are making. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it was somewhat mysterious and somewhat exciting, but that will soon change to some funny scenes - very clear scenes ... As I watched more, I almost slept several times. <br /> <br /> The ending is almost more disrupted / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it does not contain some good scenes, it's no longer "full" .
