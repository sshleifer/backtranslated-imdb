It was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with a group of movie lovers, who varied in taste, but were always keen to work as a "genius" (as one of my fellow commentators on this site had the bitterness to name this steam pile?) ; None of them found the quality of a single replacement. We have finished the film with an exciting chorus of insults and will not be reprinted here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews presented here are written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself. In the end, as one of these reviewers will tell you, he financed the film himself ?? Because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world would risk a single bankrupt or good name in connection with this film. Do not let the semi-famous actors who appear in the film attract you to their clutches ?? Christian Slater also recognizes the special features "Made" he logged into the movie without reading the script or knowing any details (crap I'm sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the poor person who stumbles in this swamp of self-indulgence written, directed, productive and financed by a man so famous that he does not admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please google " Anthony Hopkins "The Art".
