Rather an idiot attempt to evoke the mystery of Hitchcock's type, and the unexpected exchange of espionage for archeology based on the novel by Robin Cook. By the way, I've recently got a new amendment to his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. To record, the director Schaffner had just made "Children of Brazil" (1978) - he was an equally imaginative suspender but more busy, and unfortunately, SPHINX was a wrong step he could not recover his impressive career so far. <br /> <br /> Despite its reasonably decent scope and style, this film has proved to be a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the story is not very exciting: in fact, it is very depressing (in fact terrible attempts - the presence of a heroine Archeologist to overcome the tomb, the abundance of rotting corpses, and even attack by a group of bats - though). Leslie Ann Down is a beautiful lady who stumbled upon a lost treasure - she has actually been hidden by a local community to prevent her from falling into the hands of foreigners who have taken over a large part of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture) for too long. Sir John Gilgod shows early thanks for being an antiques dealer who was put down by the looting route and pays for this "act of betrayal" with his life. <br /> <br /> Typically, it is clear that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so that the emerging allies (such as Maurice Ronnett) are eventually revealed as evil, while a mysterious figure (Frank Langela, whom I saw in London in early 2007) West End The movie "Frost / Nixon," which is now a movie, moves from Discount Down to its lover and returns again, because it decides to preserve the wealth of the Egyptian king Minphta as a national treasure.
