John Hyder was very awful in this film. I felt like I was watching a bad boy playing for the first time in my student film. Anna Fares was equal to the course, not good, but not terrible (plus it was nice). Diane Keaton had to know better. Jeff Daniels was the only grace in this film (although it was also a bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm glad I did not pay for it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will remain forever stuck in the typecast role of a "dorky kid", unless he has some hard work on acting.
