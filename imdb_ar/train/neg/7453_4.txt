The actors are fantastic. <br /> <br /> A bad scenario is not a big trend either. My main problem is that I simply did not care about any of these people. Not the killer and not the victims. The settings were very nice. Dennis Quid's character was so badly written, I did not even care when the end came. He regained his son. Great deal! I wanted to restore my money.
