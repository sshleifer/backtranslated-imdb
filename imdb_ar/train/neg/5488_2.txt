Why on Earth is Colin Firth in this futile film? Was he already tired of money? <br /> <br /> The movie is not clear about what it wants to be, grief? , Exotic places? The ghosts? , A vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It is muddy and muddy. <br /> <br /> There seems to be an idea that Italy should be good, in itself, and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland. <br /> <br /> There are meaningless rings on the beach or in churches or in busy roads - but what's going on or why no one should care is simply not clear. <br /> <br /> There was also a supernatural woman in the movie. It was not clear what the job was here, but it seemed to exist only to receive obscene and inappropriate comments on the girl. Was it supposed to be about polio ?? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, all in all. I gave him 2 instead of 1 because he did not enjoy the magic of a totally awesome film.
