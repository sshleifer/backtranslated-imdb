Kim Basinger plays the role of Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who is out of business when shopping at the last minute of Christmas. After hastily placing a counterfeit note on a piece of paper and gluing the paper in the windshield of the car that ran two parking spaces, I discovered that the owners were the rainbow of a villain made up of a white man, Mexican, Chinese and black. They face around the note, covering an impotent security guard, and the chase is on. During the film, Della will go fishing as she unleashes her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be impressive. The acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, "Why God Why?" Was so neat it was worth it anyway). It has receded a little because of the absolute truth that the bad guys are chasing della from / after them stupid. If they do not have the intelligence of any specific "Home Alone", then their eventual defeat may be something to taste rather than the meh reaction it provokes. The unreliability factor I want to overlook is that both the director and one of the producers had a role in bringing "shoot em up" to the screen (a film that was thrown out of the window by the window). While this film never achieved its heights, it was good in itself. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions for Anchor Bay: Comment with author / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy. 25 minutes and a half "made"; an ad clip and two television spots for this film; and a trailer for lower learning
