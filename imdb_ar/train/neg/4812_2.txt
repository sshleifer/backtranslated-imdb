I thought that any horror film with Orson Wells in it would be strange. The recall of spirits was certainly very strange because it was good. The film already has a creepy feeling because it deals with the devil's oven / witches in a small town and a young woman tries to escape them. The director seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience with memories of the past and the sequence of dreams. By the end, there are many unanswered questions. What's worse, since the story is very confusing, it is very difficult to identify the root of any of the characters. It seems odd that Wales agrees to the title of this particular film that he does not have much to do. Perhaps someday they will put a tape of the excerpts and phenomena from this film. Now it will be really fun!
