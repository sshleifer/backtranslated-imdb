This film represents the times when I made it as much as the original, I suppose. It's really sad, because at a deeper level, the original "Vanishing Point" title is very paradoxical. I'm sure it was not intended in this way, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. The real "vanishing point" was the end of an era that ended largely in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this new version, all anti-culture elements have been stripped, and more PCs are being introduced in an attempt to reach a wider audience, most likely. "Sterilization to protect you" <br /> <br /> The inclusion of Indian-American scenes was unjustified, and the notion of a "noble purpose" of the journey was put forward. I'm glad I saw him, but he made me appreciate the original much more. The original cult is classic and golden. This remake is awesome.
