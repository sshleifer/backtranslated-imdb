This film was a confusing piece of trash. You never know what was happening. The characters were poorly written, and were mostly completely unfriendly except Gus (played brilliantly by George Eads). I hate this film but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) had to have won an Academy Award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Edez in a disgraceful and stingy movie. The old you have sunk to a new low. Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in the movies again. It was also supposed to be a horror film because it was much more funny than scary. For life's shame, for shame.
