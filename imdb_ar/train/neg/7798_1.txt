This review is based on the Shock-o-Rama video that was released in a world that was not due in 2002. How bad is this? It is terrible, which is the number "1" on the IMDb scale - but it is much worse. It's good to imagine that an original print in German has improved things - English dubbing in English is not funny at all - but frankly, this is one of the worst amateur movies of any kind you're likely to see. The zombie in the film is as slow and gruesome as it has always been and does not seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond the next meal. However, they are smart enough to run the saws and malignant enough to know that Western taboos around the genitals will undoubtedly stimulate their conversation around the dinner table. George Romero The land of the dead imposed a zombie nation that retained a tool of social cohesion. Here, the zombie is no more than a blank canvas for the perverted fantasy of director Andreas Shinas. Completely without social value recovery and, worse yet, totally lacking in entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone wasting money on them.
