There were a lot of things to mention here, but I must say that two of the demented were particularly hilarious: the schizophrenic nature of the wolf person (that is, the transition from a raging beast in one shot to a zombie-like state in a daze) the next stage - In an informal stroll in the middle of the night in the countryside, wearing a completely different wardrobe for takeoff ... and yes, I've known the reasons for this in advance), as well as the "Phantom of the Opera" Wolfstein's personal look! But what I know - perhaps the full version is elusive of this chaos of classic horror novels!
