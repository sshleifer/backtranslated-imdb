I thought watching the recruitment videos on corporate compliance was boring. This movie went anywhere quickly. What could have been a half-hour twilight episode turned out to be an apparently endless waste of film on the people who stop their cars, a picture of some dude swimming pool (really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer its job, In a yellow lit controller room repeat "T minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting will happen. He does not do this so that your hopes do not rise. The best thing about this movie is watching James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than famous TV characters, this extends to find anything good. And do not make me start with the music that was entirely composed of Tympani, some great marine mammals, and microphone comments. This film is as close as I gave it to one film, but it gets the second film because I have already managed to end this insomnia and I did not have to leave in the middle. Avoid at all costs.
