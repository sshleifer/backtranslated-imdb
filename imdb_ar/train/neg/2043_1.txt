Horrible, awful, awful. <br /> <br /> A modest observation at first and some bad autopsy pictures do not make a good film. Again, I am surprised by the determination and skill of some people in achieving film production, yet they do not have the pride to realize that what they have done is a pile of utter nonsense. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think about the value-recovery feature so that I could cash at least, but the only thing I could think of was that Pink's opening track was good .... I wonder if she saw this ? <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk.
