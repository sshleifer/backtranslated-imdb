I did not expect much from this film, but my brother, what a stink. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a huge cage of $ 5 DVDs at Wal-Mart (no other place)? As cheap as this disk was, I feel ripped off. Her special effects were a look at high school, the work of the camera was marred by incandescent triangles and superficial lighting and acting was an ideal example of the "Christian school". One can imagine long and exhausting "prayer meetings" by the production company after seeing the rush back - the people who financed this thing must have serious feelings against the Bible towards the inefficient production company that overshadowed this thing. Thought they were worried because they saw their investments of $ 914.86 rising in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian films are so bad - filmmakers may need to watch good movies and try to copy some things that make them very good. Stories and personalities believable, less hysterical waving arms and intolerance, Oh, the story appeals to everyone, not only true believers. Which. Stop the sermon, save him for the church. Take the Omen or Prophesy string, for example. Excellent movies with compelling story lines, great cinematic photography and intense music. No hysterical waving arm. Do not bode. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a laughable track, it will be much better.
