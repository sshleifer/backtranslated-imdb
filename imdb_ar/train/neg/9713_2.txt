It was the first time I watched Cold Cold after almost a year of Danish television. At the time he arrived on television, he had drowned in nearly four or five other US crime programs that had been broadcast almost simultaneously. <br /> <br /> I saw that and I was bored to death. Low actors with fair faces and ethics were pain at the back. The full premise of giving a lot of money to a team of investigators to solve murders dating from 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor because they have only 50-60 minutes to tell the story which means they are getting a break in time to resolve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive. In addition to "personal" problems and investigator relationships there must be time left to leave the exhibition completely dim. <br /> <br /> I give it a two star rating because of the music that I ended up and it is really the only reason to watch it .... which of course will not do because this is a lame TOO reason to watch this nonsense.
