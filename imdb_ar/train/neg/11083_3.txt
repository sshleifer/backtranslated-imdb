This film was late at night when I saw it. It was fun at first but he did not convince me as a whole. I'm not a fan of Tyson. In fact I do not like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and double-faced (by society) that some get the money to beat each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that the beginning of the film was fine. The actors are okay, especially George S. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the flick is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but he was quite fun. <br /> <br /> As the film continued, I felt that it had lost some of its charm and also lost interest. I managed to stay awake but the last hour was not good enough.
