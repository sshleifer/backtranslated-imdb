The film HERA PHERI from Priyadarshan was a nice circumstantial comedy. This film actually lacks a story but is very funny but illogical <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no story appropriate, but it runs in a nice way a good flow, although it is not a wonderful thing <br /> <br /> The first half contains funny scenes such as the scenes where Akshay and John invite her to lunch and another when she enters parish <br /> <br /> The first half becomes boring slowly but the second half is more entertaining although there is no script <br /> <br /> Funny jokes Although one does not wonder how they can not hear everyone's voices from inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> The noise of the peak of a play is dealt with but it is very funny but the film ends abruptly <br /> <br /> The direction is fine The music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar beats his role Now his second skin, but this is his entire film and overshadows everyone. <br /> <br /> John stumbles and fails in comedy Parish Rawal is a nice Rajpal is fine. Very noisy and sometimes very narcissistic and daisy and nito (just the nieto seen now) are very good at the parts but the shouting is often the joshi manoj is fine
