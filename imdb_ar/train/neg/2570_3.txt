I read that "there is a girl in a shorby" came out during the low Peter Slers period. Watch the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the film. Apparently, the presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; The whole movie looks as though they randomly shot everything that happened without writing anything. Maybe I did not watch every movie about middle-aged and old people trying to be hippies, but this film gives such films a very bad name. <br /> <br /> In general, Sellers and Hawn have a much better movie title than this, so do not waste your time in this. Pretty worthless.
