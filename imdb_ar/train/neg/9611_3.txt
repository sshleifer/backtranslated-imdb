There are so many horrible things about this film that I can only name it a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART: 1. His name ?? Whisperer is very easy, so I'll leave it at that, boy, Humphrey's voice is good). 2. His long curly hair and ridiculous sideburns. 3. Black Bart owner get-up, complete with Tottenham! 4. I'm not sure what color lipstick they wore, but it's not great. <br /> <br /> Character CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. Lipstick does not have any preferences, either. 2. The man is swallowed from his hat during the entire film! Can not find a hat for him? even a little?!!?! 3. His pants are very tight at the rear. 4. Puff out the smoke of his gun over and over again, if you know what I mean, I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you love Bogart or Cagney are not official, the figure may well change the pace to see them in Western, do yourself a favor and forget this thought. Even horses look EMBARRASSED! (Ie when they do not seem bored.) <br /> <br /> Fairly, I admit that Westerners are my favorite genre in the film, but I still see a lot, much better than this. <br /> <br /> At the comedy level, or as a high camp, the Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it's the viewer's beware. So, see this only if you should see every western there b) you TRUE Cagney or Bogie complete c) any of the above comments appeal to you. WOAH ?? ..
