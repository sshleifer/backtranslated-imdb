My God! Please, in order to love all that is sacred, do not watch this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life I will never go back. Sure, you've stopped watching half way through. But I thought it might get better. he did not do. Anyone who already enjoys this movie is a seriously ill and twisted patient. No wonder Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making films. All about this awesome film, from acting to editing. I do not usually write reviews here, but in this case I will make an exception. I wish someone had warned me before I hired this disaster
