Another rape of history <br /> <br /> This film is a disaster. It uses only a historical story and creates a sweet love story, with poor production and low budget. <br /> <br /> The movie must be 1/3 time, they just dragged time to make a mini-series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are stupid and illogical. Soldiers are stupid, and fashion is a disaster. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, where one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest. In this film the Romans chose to fight on the side of the city, I mean to get real. <br /> <br /> By the way Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means a light-skinned person.
