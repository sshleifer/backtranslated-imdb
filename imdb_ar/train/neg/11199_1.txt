The cruel pace of this film is numb to any shocks it may provide. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were inaccurate. The honest Irish priest was as lame as attention to love. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose may have to provide the best movie sensuality. The central conflict of the main character was not involved. This film is completely free of positives. It's like a hard workout done by someone who does not want to go to the gym that day but anyway.
