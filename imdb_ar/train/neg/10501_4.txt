Some people say Steve Irwin's oddity and his green character are nothing but an act. Watch this movie: Obviously he can not act. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, dangerman star in the small screen in the series * Crocodile Hunter Diaries * and * Croc Files * and * Crocodile Hunter * Named (are you seeing a naming trend here, or is it just me?), personal rockets * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * Yes, there is a clear trend for words beginning with "C" - basically a ring of Crocodile Hunter * mashed with B-Movie. <br /> <br /> On a mission to move a large crocodile to save him from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and wife Terry are unaware of the American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) Which he swallowed. Would it hurt my credibility to say, "They are in a collision course with an idiot?" (What is credibility? - Ed note.) <br /> <br /> The plot is not relevant, because Steve's magnetism is what drives the film. If you find that his character is trying to be a failed film, but if you are either a fan of him (as a businessman or conservative or just a qualified person) or his television programs, expect more of the same large-screen budget. <br /> <br /> John Stenton, the faithful Legion, is the best companion and supporter of Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * (Can you call it a straight face?), writes and directs with the same swagger interrupting making Steve a clown in the wildlife of the household. <br /> <br /> The most exciting aspect of this film is that Steve (one of the few people you can hear the points of exclamation for them talking) and Terry (Steve, his 10-year-old wife, the most violent ally and closest friend) As if it were one of the documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and talking directly to the camera, while all the other characters act as if they were in a bad film (well ??). Would not it be illogical if Steve and Terry were kept separate from the rest of the characters ?? But when the bad Americans threaten Steve's life, we have to ask the confused viewers why the indifferent camera crew at least call the police if they do not try to beat the bad guys in the eye with the boom boom, or yell at the pay? Anything other than shooting continues with a spectacular lighting, clear sound and seven angles of motion. <br /> <br /> While Terry was unfairly portrayed as the core of a non-moderate Steve (whose representation consists of an incompetent bold line and read in pearly pear-shaped jeans), Steve explores his work As usual in the show and the investigation with creatures determined to kill him, and do all his exciting work for himself, well, they are not really exciting work, but just a day in the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, watching this crazy Ku Koo's adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 gives a strange break to the proceedings. But for those of us who have never met, this kind of malarkey (as well as the various incarnations of the series * Crocodile Hunter * in continuous reboot operations) keep it alive as it has always been in our crocodile burrows. The disturbing reality of his absence will be obvious only to those closest to him. I wish them success in following up the huge effects ?? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this conversion for what it is? Half-baked film featuring a complete legend. Matt does what I like? Interacting with wildlife - and he could never ask for more of his long feature film filming and he does exactly that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Madmen, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
