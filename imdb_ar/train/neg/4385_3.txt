The Little Devil Assistant is one of the best B Horror movies I've seen. When I say better I mean the story. The film hatchs a new plot, something that is not clich√© in a horror genre - something new. But there are also some silly questions that come with it. Questions to ask yourself during the film. <br /> <br /> My attention to the film first caught me in the horror section of the HMV. I was tired of all the so-called "terrifying" Hollywood movies and wanted something different. My attention drew the art of covering the devil's helper's cover immediately. As you can see, the picture attracts you - it's scary! I knew it was a direct release of a DVD - but I took a chance. I mean, I just saw the "man of the dance" the night before - so it could not have gotten worse! After watching the movie, I felt good. I loved the movie plot. It was really creepy how the killer pretended to be a friend of young boys, so he could kill. In some distorted situations, I think that in fact he and the little boy will become partners - a binary of terrorism. It was a great idea to set the movie on the night of Halloween. This way, no one will think of a masked man next to a small child. They simply believed that he was his guardian. But, this is also where you start where Graphic Slots appear. <br /> <br /> If your son returns home with a "friend" tricked or treated - that's fine. You will not think of anything - if he is 9 years old, or about the same age. However, if you appear with a strange man in a mask, you will feel surprised and protected for your child. You will ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You ask why it is with your son. He does not know him. Tell him to leave. He is not a family friend. It's strange. Now, we are supposed to teach our children not to talk to strangers. In this case, my mom is fine with her. Hey? They do not seem to think it strange that the "man" is not talking at all. They think they are her girl friend, but after 10 minutes of not talking, she will remove the mask and ask him why he does not say a word. <br /> <br /> The movie moves from there. It was the thing that made me more, all my mom said "Do you want some cider?". I can not count how many times you say this in the movie. It's like, oh you die - we have cider though, everything is good !! The film began promising, and failed to present it. It was more of a horror / comedy, and so he failed to deliver. I think you could call it "Dud", "Flop" and so on. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is cover art. Even so, there is something to tell me that this is not worth the $ 12!
