This is not a good film. The preaching is very in parts and the storyline was substandard. The 3D was OK, but not fabulous. I almost slept in this film. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around 3 small flies you want to adventure and follow. Characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not so. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more special 3D effects. I also want to see more flying jokes than the mother who consistently says that the "master of flies" is sexually biased in showing women as housewives and fainting.
