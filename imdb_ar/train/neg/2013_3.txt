This film looks almost like it: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and sex scenes (tame to some extent)! The film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up in chaos. Looks more expensive than the films of director Al Adamson, but not as much as the budget viewers expect from science fiction films. The actors are very bad and unlike most Adamson movies, there are no former actors or former actors for B. Some music is fine but it is easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for many years.
