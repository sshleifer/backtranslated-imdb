Peter Sellers plays Dick Schercher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over the ship after the previous ship was killed. Although he saw a treasure being buried, he began to lose his memory and his treasure map became empty. Thus, Dick has to find someone who can see the ghosts and communicate with them (do you put an ad for it?) And help lead the way to the treasure. She does not mind how puzzling anyone can fund this useless movie. The former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talent in the film The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the well-liked and ill-lit scenes Milligan has put on the director's chair. Peter Boyle took a short mission in the first ten minutes of the film as a pirate commander. He may be very grateful for the release of young Frankenstein in the same year he was filmed and insulted, so he can stop it. Franchiusa seems dashing as a handsome scratching leader but he and the seller seem pretty desperate, even with the look and feel of even very bad sellers. They had to know that this film was being bombed even while filming it. Using such lines, I can understand any potential inconvenience: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (about to be hanged) will pay for this. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I've won "R. I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> This is one of the good jokes.It's amazing to me that a lot of the sellers materials available are still in the basement, But has been provided to the VHS for more than 15 years! How about someone stepping into the painting and launching the British television show "A Show Called Fred", which received a good reception from the Sellers and Melijan Championship and directed by Richard Leicester?
