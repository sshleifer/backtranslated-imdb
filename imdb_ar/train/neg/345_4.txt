This can not be the last Mandy Schaffer movie. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What is the small life that this person could have enjoyed, the instruction has ended ... do not blame the team; they did well, even the smallest winemakers He was a good brother, did not enter the film until the middle of it, and please put Mandy in some other movies ... She is so beautiful that she does not bury her career at this early age .... <br /> <br /> There are two types of criticism (No one seems to like this film very much.) First, the way Tracy continued at the appropriate melodramatic moment, to see everything you were supposed to see, never seen in return, Hollywood: Please stop giving the bad guys the perfect luck at the time that runs out when the peak arrives completely.It's stupid.Read better texts so you do not have to use more of these lame graphics devices.If the script is not good enough to stand up Second, Carmen will not fall for that fake trick Tracy pulled out ... It's already Tracey's fingerprints ... More bad writing / output there. <br /> <br /> I can get rid of this movie but mercy forbids it. In fact I did not hate it as it seems to others. There were not many reasons behind their making, unless it was purely a vehicle to show the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and for those who did not think it was exciting ... the character was not well written, but how can you say it was not exciting?!? One of us or the other needs glasses, and I do not think I am. <br /> <br /> MANDY is more. (Do not be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see it again as well ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did you mention that I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <: - D
