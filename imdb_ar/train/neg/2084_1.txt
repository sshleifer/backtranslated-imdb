If they give me the negative number option, I will use it. This film was really terrifying. I went to the theaters and I expected it to be terrible and somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, and the acting was painful. I wanted to go out but my friend was driving and I wanted to get the money, I think we were disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast Growth When the girls got their super strength and changed their hair, the color was wrong. Eddie Isard seemed wrong to the supernatural villain, who was strangely weak and weird. Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) came out of my mind and weird, as did the friend Matt (Luke Wilson) von (Ryan Wilson).
