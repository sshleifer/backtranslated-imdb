I had the luxury of watching this movie once when I was young, so much of the film is not clear to remember. However, I can say that it was not as funny as a movie called Deadly Tomato, and that the most memorable things of this film are the song and scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that, the film is just a scene of small tomatoes, large tomatoes circling around, people who are scared and exaggerating as people should in a movie of this kind. However, just having a very silly hypothesis and a catchy theme song does not make it a good comedy. This movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing should be taken seriously, however, you still have to make ridiculous jokes and not try to extend a moderately amusing premise to a full movie. Maybe the film was supposed to be good, as the passage that shows the older couple mentioned above and the man who was desperate trying to hit bigger tomatoes was very good. The trailer looked like a fake trailer, but it did not actually produce a full film, and a weak film.
