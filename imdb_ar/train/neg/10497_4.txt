So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man not only willing to throw himself into a river full of crocodiles, snakes, lizards and tons of pipe from the reptiles mentioned above, and the mud, not only daily, but also enthusiastically. He was never able to make me want to do that, but he managed to make his wife come closer. <br /> <br /> This film does not fall into a parallel category of film - movies for people who have just attended their teeth engraved, have a halting headache, or have no experience in movies, and thus love the quietness of the quiet (currently inhabited by Disney movies) . It's very noisy. Well, Steve is very noisy. He is very happy all the time, and will penetrate a teenager Plus (I can hear him now: "This movie was very stupid") or Tylenol with the Cody. I would say that his enthusiasm is to catch up, but if so, I will have a room full of snakes, and this has not happened yet. I have agreed it is beautiful, but I still do not want it. <br /> <br /> The Earth was already predictable. The bad guys were very bad, for a minute I thought I was shopping at an e-store for consumers. But the film was full of animals, Steve and Terry, and that's why I saw him. That plot (if you can call it) was already a reason to throw another crocodile into a truck. My expectations were low and I stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, however, that there would be little sequel, where Steve and Terry (having worked on their acting skills) had a film with a real conspiracy and more animals with fur. I still can not believe we will not see Steve anymore. I hope that Terry and the children will continue to participate in the Australian Zoo and Channel Discovery, at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without a member of the Irwin family telling me how wonderful this crocodile is. Crikey!
