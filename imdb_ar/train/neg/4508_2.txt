Andrew Glow, I did not agree more. My friend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this film awful. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They are doing all this for a man ?!" <br /> <br /> I find that these women have no strength, do not feel the fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men do not deserve to fight for them. During the dance scene in which Zhang Zi Yi won, men seem more stupid than admiration. <br /> <br /> The Japanese have a much larger population than the Chinese people, and the Japanese culture is the army. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces did not match the main things. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is very vague, and very American. If the Europeans did that with the Eastern Europeans, they would have done much better. <br /> <br /> I have to add: Most of the people who liked the film seem to be Americans. Sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything is written for you, not instinctively, not emotionally. I think the Chinese actresses are beautiful, but I could not say they were good actors in this film. Yes, cinematography is wonderful, but in fact, I can not see how these characters can be seen as complex and profound. <br /> <br /> I'll go to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
