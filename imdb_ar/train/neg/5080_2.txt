This is a review of The Wizard, which should not be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The magician is a late 80's film about the ability of a silent boy to seriously play video games and walk through the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update to The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the one who has tied 100 straws together and made some children drink from him. <br /> <br /> Now that we've discovered all that away from it, let me say this: there really is no reason to see this movie. It is simply a 100-minute Nintendo ad designed to take advantage of Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "design" in the most sense possible, because it seems that this movie was written on the weekend by the crack team of people who did not They never play Nintendo, and a man less elegant than my grandmother brought him out. Maybe if the writer and director sat and played some games together, they realized that they were about to photograph the total garbage and instead go to the vocational school to learn how to install the stereos. <br /> <br /> We hope this is a useful experience for you. It certainly was not for me. In fact, I think I probably lost some minds in watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're in the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz are all sitting there on the shelf in a very small row, give them all a chance to play Duck Hunt instead.
