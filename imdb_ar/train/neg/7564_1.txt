The man of the branch. I am so angry that I can not write a proper comment about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was silly and tied together and completely lame. Nicholas Cage ... Shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be at least fit. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt as if a huge part of the film had been left on the floor of the cutting room, and even if it was full - the film was strange and naive. Finally, leave your mouth numb and taste good and taste well. I did not hear many people leave the theater on the opening day with a lot of hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down the theater near the entrance. It's bad. <br /> <br /> I heard this compared to: Glitter, the American Werewolf in Paris and Gili. My friend was so crazy that he did not talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
