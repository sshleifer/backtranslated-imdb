"Valentine" is another horror film for "Stalk and slash" (Halloween, Friday 13th, Scream, and I Know What You Did Summer). It's certainly not as good as those movies I mentioned, but it's better than most of the movies that appeared after the first Friday movie "13th." One of those films was the 1981 Canadian film "My Valenty Valentine," which he hated so much. "Valentine's Day" film better than that, but it does not say much. Conspiracy: A naughty little boy is disturbed and joked by two of his colleagues at the beginning of the film. The film then moves years later when all his classmates grow up in the classroom, and then they are picked up one by one. The murderer is supposed to be the little boy who grew up looking for revenge. But is it? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" includes an attractive team including Dennis Richards, David Borianas, Marley Shelton, Jessica Cabshaw and Katharine Hegel. They do what they can with the materials they have, but the weak text does not really do them. There are some scary moments all the time. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
