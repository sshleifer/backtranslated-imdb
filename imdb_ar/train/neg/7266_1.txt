... However, we were told, there was an hour and another 20 minutes to go. <br /> <br /> Why, why, was there no editor to tell the writer / director stories and gossip, a clip? It seems that the writer / director has already done short work; in short, this would have been fine. But the lack of dialogue begins in 20 minutes. There is not much music glare. The background sounds (talk, traffic, especially helicopter everywhere) get old really fast. But the worst failure of the story. There are few valuables that exceed a short period of time. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw different forms of the same scene again and again. I almost yelled at the screen, "We got it, we got it !!!!!" It's amazing that after leaving the theater, we can go home, watch the daily show and parts of the Kolbert report, get ready to sleep, and know that the audience is still stuck in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to indulge in your vision. You give the audience enough to share your vision.
