Let me tell you something about this film. I've seen him twice. The first time I was a kid the movie was very fun for me. I really loved it. I thought it was fun and enjoyable and the main character was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I saw him again a few days ago. It was terrible. really. I do not know why I thought it was funny before but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing so amusing a little. He was just stupid. The story was weak. Acting was nothing special. There are great actors in this film, but acting is still mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> What's worse is that this movie is racist. really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However, I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in films such as "Shaolin Temple" or about the fact that the only black man in "The Street Fighter" is a villain or ... point. There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how they will react to a movie like "The Meteor Man". why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this film. There are no white people among good men. In fact, there is only one white person in the entire film who is the leader of the bad guys. All good people are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care is that the good guy is black, white, yellow, pink or green ... What matters to me is the fact that we can hardly see a white person in this film. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It's not just realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese film, and this is the case with "The Street Fighter", there is no problem - in Japan most people are Asians. But if there's only one white man in an American film, there's a kind of problem - in the United States, most people are white. It is like filming a Japanese film with a full white crew and only one Asian as a bad guy. Not only real. <br /> <br /> This is. I give the film a 4/10 rate. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with her as a child.
