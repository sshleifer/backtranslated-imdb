This is one of the few (if not the only) episodes with an indisputable error in storytelling. While handling the Ralphie situation, Christopher stated that he had heard about the death of Pie-O-My in the fire incident. These are important details because it is quite clear in this context that Christopher knows from the start that Tony is the person who must have killed Ralph. However, there is no way Chris can hear about the incident. Who should have told him and when? By the time he was torn apart by the delirium by Tony's invitation no one else was aware. Tony knows that - what makes it worse! Hearing Christopher's talk about the death of Pie-O-My may lead Tony to just the conclusion that Chris himself raked. Given the impressively detailed writing process as the authors themselves reported on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them realized the problem there. The story does not work this way. I do not have to add that I am a soprano. Otherwise, I definitely do not care.
