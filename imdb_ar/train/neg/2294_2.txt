Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find himself doing a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this film is very unpopular or even hateful, but Mercurio's progress is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - totally unpopular, generally dressed. Big mistake in fashion design, this one.
