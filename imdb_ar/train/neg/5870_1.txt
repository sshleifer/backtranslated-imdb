I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone here says, that the play of Clémence Poésy is excellent, which in my opinion is completely wrong! She is not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she's a very untried actress and that's why she was not able to play that role! She totally disfigured the heroine! It was so disgusting to really watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be easier for her to understand the Russian soul of a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man who did not shave for two weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye ... (Praise be to God, there are some actors in this film who played wonderfully) I assume that Alessio Boni treated his job very well! He was one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for the play.) And the only thing I liked about this work was very beautiful scenery and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the true meaning, the objective, in which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps he understands the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
