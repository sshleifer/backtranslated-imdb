She hated the way in which Ms. Perez portrayed the Puerto Ricans! We are not all a ghetto - we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not talk about the uneducated people I encountered. But our language is sound, and our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is in a better economic situation than any other Caribbean island! Am I happy that we are not like Cuba or the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of American influence? Free in real poverty, not the standard of poverty in the United States. We are not victims. We are a flexible, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our origin includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with black Americans in research 9). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizo, Che Guevara and Martin L. King will not be far from the mark. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a real revolutionary - a decent man who had a day when we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra Castro helped create Cuba that is today, which is why boats full of Cubans risk their lives to come to America - because Chi make a better place for them? You had a great idea, brilliant and bright but you politicized it too much. We have many things to be proud of as a people - not to bring shame to our people by harming us. I am not of Neo-Russian language and perhaps for this reason I can not share your views. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have been able to achieve many of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics More history More stories of victory - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaria Maldonado
