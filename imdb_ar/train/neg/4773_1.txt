Very good story, so good suspense ... but 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... What happened? Is very well done and a good story has been destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say that one vote vote ... that is what is worth, I think Chris Chadley could come the best end ... but maybe next time :) All this blood gore Meaningless for nothing? The end will raise the story to nearly 10, but it did not ... End the whole story destroyed, I think most people are not lame and when your film goes you want a good ending, even if it is complicated ... but the only lame here is the end ... sorry
