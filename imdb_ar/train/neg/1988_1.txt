Well, I've been through terrible acting. I passed by the fact that Lil Kim was blowing some guns and that her arms or hands were not moving. I passed through weaving and got colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what you killed for me: in the scene where the four roses were sitting on the table under the pretext. Lisa, Ray and Monica Calhoun stand, and then Kim's night wakes up to dismantle any hostile action by saying, "Whoa, stop, stop, let's move here for a second hot time." I'm a fan of this kind of Western film, and I've never heard anyone speak a language like that in any of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks that this movie deserves more than one rating, please tell me another film that's worse than the Roses ring. <br /> <br /> I'm on my way.
