This film was awful. I've had a hard time watching this all the time. I did not get the movie point. What was the purpose of this film? The filming was bad, the acting was bad and the story was uninspiring. The main character in the film was very boring and their conversation was uninterested. There was no chemistry among any team members. I do not know this fact, but I think most of the actors were the first time. The film could have been reduced for about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates the number of useless scenes in the movie. I would have a root canal within two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch a good and funny film and a friend of the family and made by a group of Mormons, see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
