This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still not sure whether it's serious or just a satire. One of those movies that uses every stupid person does not smile cliches he can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was really good. But otherwise sucked. I have seen him for more than 10 years, but he still hurts me and will not stop risking in my mind. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film sums up the fact of stupidity. It will not spoil you, if you want to seduce fate by viewing this movie. But I guarantee you a moment * nghya * in the end, with a few of them. If you do not have something better to do, and you want to point and laugh, it may be worth your time. In addition, if you are forced to go to an appointment with someone you do not really like, suggest you watch this movie together, and maybe leave you alone after seeing it. This is a fair price to pay, I think.
