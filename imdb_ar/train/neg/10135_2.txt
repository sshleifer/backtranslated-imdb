I watched this movie at Stars. Let me review some of the things that I thought could have been improved; representation, writing, direction, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It seemed as though the writers had no idea what the film was about. It seems that in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you can buy a sophisticated ultra-light launcher that can become completely invisible for $ 75 million. These days, these things cost about $ 3 billion, which are invisible. It is clear that you can fly from the United States to the Middle East within an hour. There was a totally random lesbian scene, I did not care about it, but it seemed to me that it was a lame attempt to attract more men to see it. The camera zooms up items randomly and skips random scenes. Oh yeah, since his film Steven Segal, predictable as hell. All in all I arrange it right there with snakes on board a plane.
