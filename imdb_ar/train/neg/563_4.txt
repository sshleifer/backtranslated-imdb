Should every "good story" be improved by adding amazing Broadway music? It is clear that those who can not reach their own plots believe that classical literature exists only for looting. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorite, because Dickens certainly wrote often things that leave you in a state of panic, and this was a great example of that ... Of course, take this serious story and add humorous music and assemble it with each character Of children orphaned young to excessive clothes, and suddenly raises them? Erg. Bring me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars come in my assessment of "casting", which can be like the star of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had actors who could boast a play version, but then they had to go and enrich them (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here can actually do it, and have survived our compassion by singing to Oliver Reid (pardon if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> My big complaint has been mentioned. Why embarrass everyone except really shameless by putting silly songs in a perfectly good story? This has rarely been done to a good effect. Overall it spoils the story. I did with this one. The jury is still debating whether this story deserves saving, but with all this information, it is impossible to tell.
