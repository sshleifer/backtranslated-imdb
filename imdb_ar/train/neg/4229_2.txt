I'm a big fan of low-budget horror films, but come on! This must be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I have ever seen! I have ignored the reviews posted on this site, considering it will fall in my taste in horror, but I felt bored and extinguished. From the home warehouse. The masks were made of tin-like tin. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was very good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low-budget film. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was terrible! I do not mind dubbing. I find this comic in the movie "Premutos" in Ittenbach (a wonderful film). The fighting sequences were very bad movement. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You do not see any of the Schnaas movies. There are much better directors such as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same genre and theme. Check Premutos, Blood House, Shram and nekromantiks.
