This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and non-original show produced by Australian television stations to achieve local content quotas. The writing was truly shocking, and it is no surprise that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian film in his recent memory, The Honorable Wali Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this television series was funny - never - not even amusing. He was tired and BAD, and worst of all, he really thought it was funny. It was very embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very exciting about displaying this offer on 10 out of 10 on the IMDb. Try to find a review (genuine) by an Australian (real) viewer for the show (there was not much) and this is impossible. Or crazy. There is a more entertaining loaf of bread than this offer. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it happens on a DVD, remember that the laughter it deserves was unintentional.
