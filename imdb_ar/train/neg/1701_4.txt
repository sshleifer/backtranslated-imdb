David Lynch, a raw and brilliant film in South Park, offers us a nightmare of disturbing cliches about middle-class families in the suburbs. The father is an ugly monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular nozzle that utters the most dreadful pastoral voices. The son and the mother are constantly horrified, incoherent creatures, terrorism is their way of life. A number of equally ridiculous characters are presented throughout the chain. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedy films (ie on the air, Wild at Heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedy in general. However, there were two scenes in Dumbland which made me laugh out loud. There are some smart pieces of motion picture - Lynch moves a wide range of reactions in his characters through the grammatical arrangement of shots rather than facial expressions (which are never different in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch was really trying to give his audience a direct and disturbing comedy here. Interestingly, he chose to follow the last wave of very low humor (Will Farrell) with the addition of elements of fierce social criticism, classic violence of animation and total humor. Although the mix does not work very well here, it is nothing if not Linchen. <br /> <br /> Worth watching from Lynch fans.
