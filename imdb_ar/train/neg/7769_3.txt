Scratched the real head of Bill Reuben, who seemed to be getting worse in his trade throughout the 1980s. Three millionaires invite nine people to a distant hotel to compete in another permanent contest where the ultimate winner will be awarded a million dollars provided that he or she has achieved that limit. A series of lame pranks is pulled out on some guests while others share what most adults will do under these conditions and specifically get smashed at the hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different parts of the female body including the opening dance number, which is a crossover for American Bandstand where he meets old exercise with prostitutes. If there is any hesitation in that white people can not dance, this scene beats the last nail in the coffin. Pay close attention to slip the nipple. This continues for forty-five minutes until Bill Reppen begins to throw arrows at various plots and whatever happens to him becomes a source of inspiration for the next scene, which makes this disorder heterogeneous. It's a game so it's not a game. The three ancient game in full control not even. The hotel has supernatural power to become just a props. They have died so no. Even the narrator in the end replies that he does not know what the hell happened. I challenge anyone for a reason where Rebane was being this one. The representation is dinner dinner theater minus dinner. Most representatives may have returned to their daily jobs at the local Stuckey. I give it a few points to the scene where the yuppie billboard opens and the skeleton inside the skull fills itself. Let's see gone with the wind do it! This classic set of chilling has become a curse to me. Damn it, get it! Like Reeben! I hate myself.
