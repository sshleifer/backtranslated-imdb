I think I saw this film, but do not quote from me, I may be asleep while watching it because it did not "catch the excitement and imagination." At least I know I've seen enough of it to know I will not see it again soon. Or never. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talking about GIMP ... really lame. Totally lame. You will not like a six-year-old child. It did not have a major impact. Nothing. Nada. Just turned turned into Drake. comedy? Was it supposed to be a comedy? I've been deceived Ya cana me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if aliens eat meat as unsatisfying as in the film "Creatures", we could make human characters do something a little deeper than being very nice and pleasant ... like yelling, yelling and running on Their lives are not even eaten, so the story may be more exciting than watching dry paint. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this. Not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. Such as watching dry paint. Or sleep.
