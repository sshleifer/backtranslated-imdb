This movie is part of the film "White Zombie", because it is made by the same man (Halperin) and includes a zombie. Halperin failed, George A. Romero in his day, in fulfilling this, <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and seek to destroy the source of his power so that zombies can be sent free of charge. Also, there is a love interest for the wicked man. <br /> <br /> This movie really excels in the pictures. Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and zombie looks very strong in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we could not really see a lot of zombies at work and it seems that the story of love plays a very big role in the horror film (although this has a true conspiracy reason later). <br /> <br /> I wanted to see some zombies in the 1930s attacking the helpless people of the city, but this film was not delivered. No strong villain (like Bella Lugusi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. The use of Logos eyes? It's a beautiful, but misleading, effect because it's never seen in the film ... why not bring it back with the new actor? In general, the movie can be great with a little rewrite of text and can someday be a powerful new version (especially if kept in the same post-war context). Heck, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes", this film has hope.
