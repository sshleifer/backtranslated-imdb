I once promised not to go out of any film (a personal policy that made me suffer from the most different dreck types, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi and Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awesome experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are a painful and pathetic group. It shows a world without love and humanity, a world in which people humiliate each other for one reason only - to divert attention from their miserable existence. By choosing a style similar to a documentary with non-professional actors (most of them directly from the imagination of Austrian cartoonist Dix), Sidel wants to make us believe that this is real life in the Austrian suburbs. The viewer faces images of the Arab race, violence against women and the disabled, insanity and degradation. But this is not social criticism. This is just a pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, and bad filmmaking. If anyone needs a film like that to realize that there are wrong things in our society, this person must have passed through life with closed eyes. This is false social criticism with a sledgehammer. People are seen in a disgusting transcendent manner. This shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But it depicts ordinary people in an ugly and deceptive way. That is why this film is really despicable.
