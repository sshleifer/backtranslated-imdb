I watched this movie last night and wished for the best after watching all the wonderful trailers. Until the DVD cover appeared well. As soon as I started watching him I was thinking like others "Oh my God what this is." There were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined because of the stupid music. There was rock and opera during what was supposed to be disgusting scenes. There is really a ruined it for me and shook my head as I think of money. Rental and deceived by the art of the cover. Nothing against the music itself, it was only in the wrong parts of the film. All the editing of the film has no idea what they are doing. The cover showed lightning, implying that they were caught in the storm at sea. It could have been more interesting but it did not happen. The acting was not the worst I have ever seen, as they are all unknown, and this is evident for their first film. The other disappointment was that the plot was not logical. At first, the two men saw all the teenagers getting a boat, and then in the end there was supposed to be one girl and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts I'm not sure because he was filmed so badly. WhyteFox, which wrote a comment here, claims that this is a true story. She believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a boat in the area where the film was filmed. This film is not mentioned as a true story. I have never experienced such a thing personally, but I do not say it is impossible. I think if anyone interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you love horror movies amateur students that you may like.
