I had the misfortune of wasting 10 for buying a new SS movie on DVD: The Power of Attack. Now I can usually suspend my belief by watching movies like this. A pinch of salt and some beer in a dark evening on the couch you see a loud scream late in the evening, ideal for the male of one thousand like me. I bought this movie and I was thinking about seeing brilliant martial arts and shooting. <br /> <br /> You did the hell. Segal is old and swollen, the plot was so ridiculous by SS standards and to strengthen everything from Segal's work (as it was at the beginning) is very bitter. Even in fact, half his voice was called by a man who did not look like him. Either the SS SS no longer work (point of contention) for the crew was so horrible in their jobs that they could not record the sound properly. The sound was turning back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the guy who is registering for Honda ads! <br /> <br /> The wise story was not that most of the action films were based on the same premise, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters that will die as horribly as the destructive fodder and the bad guys are waiting to collapse. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you avoided walking in front of an accelerated train or a dose of avian influenza H5N1. <br /> <br /> Trash pronunciation. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
