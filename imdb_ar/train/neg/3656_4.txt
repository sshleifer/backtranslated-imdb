I must admit that I was a sucker for samurai jokes since I remember. I used to watch fairly randomly, whether it was "elitist" acting like the Seven Samurai or the bloody difference to a comic book like Lun Wolf and Chebble. I also liked the US / Japanese "transitions" like The Bushido Blade. Of course everything contains Soniba Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. I have actually seen all samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993 I saw Kabuto for the first time on a video, so Samurai movies can be boring. At first I was looking forward to reaching Mayeda to Europe and the confrontations that would come from it, but by the time he actually arrived in Spain, I no longer cared much about this film. <br /> <br /> Justice will not do the movie to call it "bad". Technically, it is a clean introduction to this type. But there is simply never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as director and actor and has only a fraction of the charisma of the Japanese actors mentioned above. He talked about Xu Kusogis, Ken's son, who appeared in almost all the films of Xu Kusuji as a son Chos: He inherited a few of his father's acting skills. Adding to the minus points is the lack of blood and gore until then it was a trademark of all Samurai movies. Obviously this was for a younger European-American audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's a great movie for fans of historical adventure and motion, but it's a lover of Samurai movie lovers. Fans who participate in "Samurai Meet ??" - Type, go and watch Red Sun (1971), with Charles Brunson as a cowboy who has to collaborate with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve the Samurai sword from the bad guys Alan Delon. It's how to do it correctly and where there was an error in Kabuto. <br /> <br /> So, although the movie does not exceed 100 minutes, it only sounds like a much longer film. <br /> <br /> The reason I was given this 4/10 honorable points instead of 3/10: for the first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the simultaneous German version. In this version, Kosugi can already be understood. I must admit that "Engrish" is funny at times, but it tires after about 30 minutes.
