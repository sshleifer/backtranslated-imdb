If I could say that it was better than Jimcata, I felt at least that my money was not completely lost. <br /> <br /> Then I watched Steven Segal's film on a mortal land. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen despite the resurrection on MST 3K. If Santa Claus, the marauding invaders, can explode the head of Tom Cervo, one wonders about the chaos this film can cause. <br /> <br /> There is a good reason why Kurt Thomas did not practice cinema. The book of this abstraction must be forced to wear banners every day of their lives saying "bitch slapped me! I was a writer in Jimkata".
