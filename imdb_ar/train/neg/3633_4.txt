Of the 10 actors who filmed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed to be his most impressive character, but in this scenario, the audience outweighs the famous detective. After all, when the knight, Douglas Walton, stared at the vacuum in space, obviously hypnotized, saying something like "I must ride and kill", I felt it was stupid not to be picked up after being killed. The police thought he was suicide because he said he would! After shooting the owner of the horses Jean Lockhart and shooting him, Freda Inscort does the same, saying she will be killed, and then jump off a bus. I laughed when Louie finally shouted "I got it", as if it were a revelation. Only the guilty party cleverly concealed and there was a great suspense was created when this party began to low-sleep Louie to induce him to jump off the surface.
