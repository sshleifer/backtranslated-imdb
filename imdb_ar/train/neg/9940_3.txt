In the 1960s, as a background, rehearsal and recording "Sympathy to the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar" by revolutionary revolutionary Rolling Stones? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones? In addition to Marianne Feithfull, Godard reveals other revolutionary and ideological movements contemporary? The black power through black leopards, the women's movement, communism and fascism - are accompanied by the reading of a cheap political novel Pulp divided into chapters: Rolling Stones; The Foreign Black Novel; Sight and Sound; All About Eve; The Heart of the West , "Inside the Black Syntax" and "Under the Beach Stones." <br /> <br /> "Sympathy to the Devil" is another boring mess for the unequal director Jean-Luc Goddard, the narration and the footage are appalling, but fortunately I love Stones and "sympathy for the devil" It is nice to see them at the beginning of their career, otherwise this documentary will not be possible. Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the Devil"
