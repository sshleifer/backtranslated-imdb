This is certainly not one of Lucio Fulci's best films in any area of ​​fiction. The plot is very bad, killing the millionaire and calling his daughter to squirt to see who did it. But the big problem I face with this (along with knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why anyone should care? The father starts off from being a really big jerk for everyone he met (including the daughter who asked for his help) making it very difficult for anyone to care who killed him. But no one is actually watching the fuss about the story of Fulci about a good story, doing so would be a pornographic watch to write and shoot an incredible script. His films usually try to compensate for this by adding extravagant scenes to the revolution, but even that does not exist in this film. If you are looking for a good Fulci flick, check out "Beyond".
