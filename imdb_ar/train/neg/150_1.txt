Dude, really! Where have you guys been for the last 20 years, this is horrific in all ways, horror? If you want to look at the classics, the freaks of Todd Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the beast, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Googler, The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can not compare them , They give it a bad name, misconduct, a bad cinematic script, and so on. We have seen a lot of money and leisure time, we have watched a lot of movies, as was my favorite horror all the time, I really can not speak, I have nothing else to say that please do not do your best to see something strange, please understand
