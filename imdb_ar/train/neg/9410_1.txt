As long as you can suffer it! If you like watching people wake up, wake up, dress, bathe, prepare for dinner, watch each other or have sex in the dark, then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like small apartments or narrow bedrooms, long minutes of silence .... If you want to be bored for two hours, and feel thrilled by the "real fake real art", you will love it. But if you do not, try watching a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you are here," but do we want to stay? The German film won the Turin Film Festival award: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made a bad decision, with the festival presenting many talented films. Maybe you're nice with a German, so you do not get prizes often? Well, the "life of others" did ... but this one is excellent but not gay. So maybe it is a fashion issue. Germans are "in" again? It does not matter what? Or maybe just a crooked look from some directors?
