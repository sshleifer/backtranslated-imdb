I can not believe that many of them compare this film to the Argentinian. Its more creative and ruthless - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The scenes of murder - let's face it, that's what this kind of thing is about - are not interesting. It was not hard to guess the identity of the killer, and I was not really interested when it was revealed. The cinema is unforgettable, and the Gothic atmosphere, which was very well received in the 19th century, did not appeal to me. Many very good actors (especially the school principal and the sadistic girl who overcame young students), are given very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are ringtones from incest, sadomas and lesbians, but surprisingly they add very little spice or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
