What made me follow this movie is the vampire show, I thought I should get the other films made by this guy (Larousse), and I was sorry to have followed it, it's a weak attempt in a mysterious / demonic movie with sex and sex only (with actors and actresses) The only factor is setup and atmosphere, avoid this one, and a lot of noise surrounds it, not worth the effort to find it, this indicates welcome to the grind house version, I hope it has some other movies that live up to Vampyres, oh, and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is what the noise carries.
