Much of Rohmer's digital technology has been used to "fill" the background. Sometimes, works well, the scene that Grace was and watched by a maid from a remote execution of the king is particularly spectacular. At other times, the film gives a strange, amateurish look, like a home video. However, the main drawback is that the phenomenal synthesis in the scene of Mise en creates a strange influence in the renderer. We know that what we see is not true, how do we feel personalities? To be frank, I never cared about what happened to the lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> Another major failure, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. In almost every scene, the success of the film depends on its performance. Well, she speaks a foreign language but is unable to express real feelings. Her emotional feeling in the scene speaks of her friend Mei de Miller (an excellent performance by the beginner Helena Dubail) and she sees the head on a column that caused some embarrassing laughter in the audience. Also, see her hands as she expresses feelings! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very disappointing, especially given the positive comments on this site.
