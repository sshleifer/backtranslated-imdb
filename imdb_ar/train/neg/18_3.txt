This artistic film was produced either in 1969 or 1972 (says the National Film Preservation Foundation 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the deadline, the film seems to be highly indicative of this general time period - with some of the artworks of the camera and Pop art dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of three simple images that are distorted by various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is no dialogue or plot of any kind. Obviously, the goal of this is to be like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it is interesting at first but it quickly becomes exhausting. The film, to put it more clearly, is a full bore and will attract no one, but perhaps those who made the film, their families, their friends, and perhaps very few people only in the hip and "with" to our understanding of humans.
