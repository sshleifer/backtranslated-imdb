If the novels of derived and predictable rape are the thing you prefer, you are rare ... do not really attract me, so I did not find anything to recover this strange story. It seems like something directly from the 1980s, in a different era, it could have been directly into the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work fine using a weak script and boring script. But what does Gillian Anderson do in such a film after starring her role as Lady Didok in commissioning BBC television at Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by the near-practical rape and his work on documentaries, but even this is not an excuse for the strange sight of a group of Dyer fishing dogs. I do not think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I do not understand is the participation of the companies behind this film - For Four Verve Pictures. Both have participated in some of the largest independent British films in recent years. Verve Distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads are not worth mentioning at the same time. Take FilmFour and Verve Note: Is this really the best you can do? What will independent British directors give you about your artistic judgment? It's a big splash on all of your reputation. Listen carefully: Can you hear thousands of independent British filmmakers crying in despair?
