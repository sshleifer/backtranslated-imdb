... which is not exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better film. Certainly, in this film, Matt Borlange played a full bag where he spent the entire film crying from eating his little brother by DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better. Here are the problems of "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer alligator looks like a small child with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. sank into an abandoned island, which faced a frenzied group of ugly Filipino citizens who were trying to impose themselves on women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crocodile time. There are two characteristics of replacing "Blood Surf" - very attractive actresses and Matt Borlenghi eaten by the crocodile at the end of the film. But if you're on a deathbed and you only have time to watch a crocodile and one dead Burlingy / Killer, skip this one and shoot "DinoCroc" instead.
