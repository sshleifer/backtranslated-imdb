"Gone with the Wind" is one of the most exaggerated films in history. It is a beloved film of mothers, grandmothers and sections that go to the cinema every five years. As a zombie film, blows. There is no shining body on the horizon, and it is terribly light in the section of injustice. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is great on exploding corpses and very generous with bloodshed - hence, it is better than "Gone With the Wind". Nor is it exaggerated. Most reviewers under any illusions that it is garbage. However, the trash is not boring. After a terrorist steals a virus, drops it while being followed by a helicopter, and leaks chemicals to the ground. The terrorist, who was in a bad mood, is hiding in a hotel room where he slowly turns into a zombie who eats meat. One of his first victims is the cleaning lady. As soon as it bites, the brand of Lucio Fulci collapses. As usual for the Fulci flick, the representation is awful, full of story with the holes of the plot, and abundant gore. It turned out that the film was directed by Folsi and Bruno Matte, which explains his somewhat schizophrenic nature. It was filmed very badly, badly edited, and flat sound design. Still, it is saved by adhering to the joyful ugliest pace murders. Definitely worth picking up if you complete the undead. Or do not like "Gone with the Wind", no doubt the worst zombie film of all time.
