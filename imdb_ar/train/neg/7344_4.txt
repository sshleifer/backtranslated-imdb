This is the story of a young woman who was seduced and then drowned by her older lover after her marriage; avenging herself against him, and all members of his family, through black magic? She is, disappointed, she does not do the same but has someone else doing her. Good production values ​​for Thai horror flick. But the nice scenario never gives rise to suspense, the director deals with the material quite traditionally, and the recent act loses viewers' empathy with the victims by casting the wind in the wind. At some point, the character has the ultimate chance of shooting at the evil dead, and instead gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. Bad writing ?? You are soaking it! <br /> <br /> Some effects of the fetus have exploded, including the body of the tasteless late embryo and the man who died due to the presence of hundreds of live snakes from his stomach. Recommended only to professionals of this type who simply have to see every horror film produced in Asia over the last 15 years.
