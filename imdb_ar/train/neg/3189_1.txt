I think this goes to prove that Joe Don Becker will do something for money. The concept of the film was not good at first. This movie contains a lot of bad things about it and I do not know where to start. Acting is terrible. Filming is marginal at best. The soundtrack was very bad. The result is terrible. There is a reason for this film to end on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I can not believe that 9 people really believe that the film is excellent. They must have loved the dancers. The final justice would be if they closed this stink in the movie cellar outside Wichita and did not let anyone see it again! Rated 1 out of 10 is much better than it is worth.
