Lame, vulgar hero film motion. I had high hopes in this film, and the kind of legitimate representatives in Hong Kong is one I do not despise, but I rarely see a story as trivial and funny as it was. This was tolerable, as always in these types of films, when the procedure is compensated, unfortunately, he did not. The procedure contains the brand surrealism and the upper nature of Hong Kong's work, but it does not involve much, and is very durable, and in fact often quite incoherent (perhaps due to the re-editing of the American version, it shows signs in many mixtures places). I was very disappointed.
