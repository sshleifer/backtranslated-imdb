It turns out that some of the films you have chosen for the pound are fairly good - the twenty-third century films have produced dozens of mysterious Italian and American films that were wonderful, but although Hardgore has released some Fulci movies among other films, Nonsense zombie records. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not in the vicinity of annoying unpleasant smelling. Other than that, it is an out-of-the-way film with Lego's technical efficiency built from husks. <br /> <br /> It has been noticed somewhere else, but you really have to worry about a movie that inserts work previews into its credit sequence, so by the time it hits the zombie attacks, you've seen everything already. <br /> <br /> Bad film fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 errors of continuity and the demonic representation of the cast (especially the park, which was so bad that made me laugh a bit), and the glory of Hardgour to get to the spirit of things by issuing a very bad version I felt like I was watching some home videos on a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Horrible things are terrible. We all made things like this when we got a camera, but common sense is that these films are in our own reservoirs somewhere. Avoid.
