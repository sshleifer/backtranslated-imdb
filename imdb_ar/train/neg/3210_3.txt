There is really no way to overcome the bush by saying this, Lady of Death: The animated image sucks only. Apart from the fact that the main character is a talented blonde about hell in a leather bikini with occasional transitions of graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with a cartoonist mentality of the 1980s based on a group of movement figures. The same bad guy speaks up like a wannabe skeleton man, has an incompetent follower, and lives in a bunker that looks like a plaid after the villain's field of blackstar cartoon on Saturday morning. Just do not expect any teaser other than the bad dialogue at times. At other times, it seems like a kind of anime tale most suitable for Hentai, yet there is no kind of sex, there is no deceitful rape (thank God!) And very sexual attraction, this despite the physical appearance of the character title. Simply put, there is no adult edge to this article, unless you return a half-naked heroine and bloody death. Basically, what we have here is a long ring of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with faded clothes and more dresses.
