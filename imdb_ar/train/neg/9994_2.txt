Hmmm, a sports team in a plane crash, gets on snowy mountain paths, and faces the difficult decision of eating the flesh of his dead comrades to survive. Does anyone seem familiar? I refer to "Alive" from 1993. The only major difference here, of course, is that the great white grappa of the Yeti shows a few times to draw the dead. I think humans taste better than the collar. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when searching for Yeti, and does not have a backup. <br /> <br /> The crash is quite fake. It would either explode in the air, or explode when it hits the ground, or becomes vivid. People will not have survived, but hey, it's a science fiction. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived, they are cold. It may be a good idea to harness some burnt debris nearby so as not to freeze to death. Fire is warm as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot forms around his face during frost and talk, but oddly enough, no one does it. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the players tells others to search for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the ON FIRE plane around them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They found coats and hats, but there are in the Himalayas, they fail to use the hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They stare at a pile of sticks when I repeat, there are parts of the plane burning. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are famous for their storms. It would make sense for them to collect debris in order to enhance their structure rather than sitting outdoors. There are a lot of pine trees around, which make their branches excellent. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use the dead man's arm as an adult. <br /> <br /> WTF: If the only person knows a lot about hibernation habits in squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, why not know enough to shelter him and put the traps straight from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When you try to trap wild animals, silent conversation always helps near the trap mentioned. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it is to cut a frozen corpse with a glass crust ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two stood there helplessly. Yeti ripped the man's heart and trampled the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So, there are two Yetis and an appropriate crash to bury the evidence forever .... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story goes on more stupidly, but most events occur in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Thinking nicely with the spear and chain, although this is some ingenuity (with a magic show series) they lacked at the beginning of the film when they could not shoot despite the fact that everything was around them. As usual in science fiction, the beloved couple finally accepted nothing like nothing terrible to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and did not brush their teeth in a few days). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is a lame quote.
