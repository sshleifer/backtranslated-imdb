I would have left the movie halfway if I had not been with people who were impressed. The film is based on real events, but ended up at the top and never felt it. I have a psychological background, sit with a lot of psychotherapists, and I knew crazy people very seriously, so I do not think such people do not exist. But in the film, the only characters who seemed to be a persistent human being were Augustine's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augustine (Jack Caiden). (Though Ivan Rachel Wood was an interesting leak - very exciting with a wicked sense of humor). There were a few amusing moments, but the general tone of the film was bleak, strange and sinister. What a wonderful waste! As I watched them pass through their roles, I felt like I was watching a line of acting. I was brought home during the credits, when a few people were just sitting there, not acting, not talking. Those few moments were more amusing than the previous two hours.
