This is one of the most irritating and annoying films I've ever had. Every time you start looking like it may be good, more memories come of the dark past, followed by the folly of paranoid masquerading as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulator, rebellious, living in a palace apparently without any religion or responsibility. Cast are all the most beloved and interesting, but unfortunately did not develop. We also do not really understand John Stanton's personality that is supposed to affect Maddox to commit rebellions. One time, I thought that "Aha! Maddox is just nuts, and it's a secret that all those contacts from mental patient Stanton escaped! Now we get somewhere! But of course, it does not end this way, and it turns out that the entire film makes no sense , Both from the Maddox perspective or the viewer.Where is Ferris Bueller when we need it?
