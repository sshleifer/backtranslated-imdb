It is hard to believe that David Duchovny in 1997 was at the top of his fame, where X-Files, one of the best science fiction series ever, was at the height of glory. After nearly nine years of forgetting him, and his attempts to make him on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain the reason, he is a fair actor, but perhaps his famous fame to an eternal role needs a great talent to get out of it. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was less famous, and was really lucky that a film like "Play God" did not lead her career to a standstill. Fortunately for her, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" were waiting behind the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> A movie. It's the only big screen film for Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. Everything is normal, and most of what happens on screen is expected in this story for a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar to find himself working with the mob. The sound outside the screen is very bad, with the moral text killing any shades of cinematic experience from the film. You may not meet the movie but at the DVD rental shops or on the TV. Try to look for something better.
