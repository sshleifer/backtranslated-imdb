The flick, made in the early 1980s, has a curse on him and anyone tried to end it. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film - as well as reviving the curse of the deadly films. A great idea for a movie, but sadly that "Cut" is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best record in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was as strange as "Holwing III" (1987), which was half a US film anyway. As for our invasions to comic horror, it is best to leave "Melting the Body" (1993) forgotten. The "Cut" problem lies in the fact that manufacturers are trying to create an intelligent horror satire "Do not Cry" (1996) but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. Although it sounds odd to say this about a slash film, what really lacks "Cut" really is "Heart." They certainly follow the basic "rules" set by the "cry", but they do not want to play with the formula, they even go for a copy of the cardboard earlier. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most wicked and uneducated villains in the history of horror movies. And an endless bound in an embarrassing way, would make the lovers associate the dialogue between two people who looked like Shakespeare. The cast never seems fully involved and seems to be waiting for the end of the shootout so they can collect their payment checks. The film feels like trying deliberately not to be creepy; it looks more like a ring of "neighbors" or "high heartbreak". By the way, those attempts appear in MTV style, and excessive cinema during the "search" sequence is just lame, dated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia has had a chance to frighten again (I hope we are still doing) perhaps we should take a paper from Mad Max (1979). Instead of trying to copy US, you should try to take our own kind.
