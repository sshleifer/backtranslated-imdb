Please do not rent or even consider buying this movie. They do not even have the red box for renting which will cost $ 1 and I think its worth less. The main reason I was hired to rent this movie was because Jenna Jameson in the movie Laughs between 2-5 minutes. I will give credit to the fact that the movie contained hot chicks and a little nudity but otherwise, you can also buy another horror movie with the same thing with no one you know. Ginger Lynne has more time in this film than Gina, and she is not even on the front cover of the film nor her name. I recommend people watching zombie strippers because you see Gina almost throughout the entire movie and most of the nude movie is a great disappointment and a waste of time.
