I will start apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms "filmmaker", "film" or "film" in relation to this, but "crime" and "crime against humanity" seem to be somewhat harsh. <br /> Writing: pathetic. Output: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Acting: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: Very incompetent for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to compile this savage action: Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> This lost part of the waste can not be called cinema. The majority of family home movies are close to earning this distinction from Revenge Quest. No, this is just a collection of 10 cars captured by video. <br /> <br /> We will skip this plot in this review, because there are a lot of holes to be covered at one time. Let's just say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. Calling one-dimensional representation is to give them credit. What is few there, is terrible at first, and made matters worse by video and terrible editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, despite the plot, must be the effects ... or rather the disturbing shortage of it. There are no blanks in the guns, there are no patches, and what are the few sound effects that were either "guns" sounds, or were created by mouth (yes, I've read it correctly). The director had the audacity to actually record the "shh" sound for elevator doors; I thought he felt it made them look more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in 2031, after all. This does not explain the sounds created by the mouth for fist battle scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's not bad enough, the sound quality will be awesome (use the microphone that was just installed on the camcorder, and it shows), the use of the gun sounds was worse than not using any sounds at all. Sound effects emerge from the rest of the soundtrack like Yak drunk in a herd of sheep, as she is clumsy. This photo: The bad guy enters the office building looking for his prey. The lady begins to fear. He raises his gun (Azi) and shakes it. We hear a clear voice that it is not uzi. The woman escapes the camera, and suddenly one (only) blood bag (on her back) (she looked like she was hit by paintball) exploded, falling on her face. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind that my description gives a lot of fairness to the inefficiency of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, which makes the movie - but not quite - makes the movie funny enough to watch it, is done in a drawer. The bad man chases the good man and the lady who protects her down the stairs, shakes his plastic clothes all the way. You may want to ducks. There are timeless sound effects flying everywhere. <br /> <br /> Alan DeHerrera can not possibly have been trapped by the collision of this train wreck, but he has followed all the way to release and launch it. If there is any justice, there must be some Karma with his name on it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this part of the industrial waste - and I strongly advise you not to see it - make sure you see it for the whole viewer almost literally lifted from the Bladerunner, AM radio which doubles as a wireless device. Try not to focus too heavily on the plot; it will not hurt you any more if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars of 10. This is a vineyard.
