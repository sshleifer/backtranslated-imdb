I work at the Blockbuster store and every week we have films that come with a few copies, these are the movies that Sci-Fi offers. This type of film that nobody wants at all, and only rent these idiots, when they return, ask them "Was it good?" , They say "No, we stopped it after 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible computer created, super monsters slapped, and the like, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> This is the same kind of movies that Grendel, and an absolute waste of time, if you reasonably want (and only reasonably) a good film based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who also starred 300 minutes into the game, such as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, later this year, we have another Beowulf film, with starred actors ranging from Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let that revive your hopes as we did with all of Aragon, or we are all in for another great disappointment. <br /> <br /> With regard to rents, here is a creative rule: if there is only one copy or two copies, do not hire it because it is a load of nonsense. (This is true 99.9 percent of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign or documentaries.)
