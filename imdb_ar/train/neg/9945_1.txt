After watching about half of this movie, I noticed something strange ... I found myself constantly moving across TV channels to see what was running - not exactly a good movie feature. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being performed in a number of species, and I must say that it has often failed miserably in each of them. 80% through the film turned to watch an old replay instead. Bottom line - the whole film felt as though those who made it did not know exactly what to make and end up cooking without a distinctive taste.
