While watching the movie, I'm not sure how calm it would take. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his actions and act in it too, you can not do everything. I felt that the story really suffered in this film because the director wore a large number of hats. Ms. McTeer is the film. To add to her amazing talents, she was photographed for this woman who is why I was engaged. Here is a British actress that can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes the drama and story fascinating. I felt that this film did not have it. Everything was fairly easy for the characters, and there were no real obstacles preventing hackers from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie to get the sweetness, but most of all is the wonderful performance of Ms. McTeer.
