With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most stupid movies ever produced. It is around a tourist ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wants to be a comedy on a cruise ship. First, there is no funny or clever line in the entire film frankly. It is very strange that it is pathetic. Not surprisingly, there is a lot of sexual or sexual humor, but the word "and" many. The budget is really low, and this spoils the film too. This is done on a cruise ship, but they seem to have only money to rent a small boat and have money for 10 additions to the ships, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are inexpensive cartoons, which are pathetic. I hate this movie and anyone else thinks that this will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. R rating for language.
