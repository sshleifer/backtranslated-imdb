This movie may have been silly like The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Example: <br /> <br /> 1. For the sake of forging her sinking Roberts is taking secret swimming lessons at YWCA. After her "death", YWCA asks her husband to work to offer their condolences. Hello how did they get their number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving town, her wedding ring falls in the toilet. After days or even weeks, Baal found her in John. Does this mean that the toilet has never been cleaned up? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation was given as to how she paid for her mother's care at the retirement home (because she did so behind their wealthy husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. Near the end of this boring film, Roberts suspects that her husband is at home. Instead of running for her life, she flees into the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly.
