This film lacks ... everything: story, representation, surprise, ingenuity and spirit. After 15 minutes, I was staring at the screen, saying, "How can all these guys meet and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" In the last fifteen minutes, I was praying to Amanda Pitt as much as possible. When a bad movie quietly raises its ugly head, the eye candy is a nice consolation. But there was not much of it! Trick on all fronts!
