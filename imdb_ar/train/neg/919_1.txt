Although I have to admit that I laughed at watching this movie more than the last few comedy films I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget must be a pocket change of representatives. Production values ​​are so low that they make it fun to watch. Robot Monster reminds me of a man wearing a gorilla suit wearing a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the unfortunate victim cuts off her arm and leg. Geez, hard to believe but the sight of the Black Knight of Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim did not start yelling "Nothing should pass" and "It's just a physical wound, I was worse." It was one of the scenes I saw last year. <br /> <br /> The "Gladiator / Devil" was also a mystery. Between the terrible terrible outfit and the look of the eccentric genius man in it the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> A movie is really bad enough to be a scene. It is somewhat like watching a slow auto accident in the movie. <br /> <br />
