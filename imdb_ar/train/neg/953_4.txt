"Happy Go Lovely" contains only two things. These two are Fira Elaine. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of the M-G-M musical complete with second-class stars. I imagine that Vera Elaine has taken this role, believing that it may finally push her to become a major musical star. But, I regret to say, Ms. Elaine's opportunity has not borne fruit. <br /> <br /> I opened with a horrifying Scotsman and stumbled into a terrifying dialogue with the next boring tone, this film looks heavy and dirty. The expected false identity plot is very weak, and with the exception of David Neven, Cesar Romero (who outperforms his role as producer) and Bobby Hughes (who is completely lost in the role of none) the rest of the cast is completely oblivious. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives it all. She was never as famous as most other musical stars (she should not have been because she could not sing but had a "dance" in many of her pictures.) But when she was dancing, it was just entraniting. It is very bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
