The Little Mosque is one of the most boring comedy films I have ever seen. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programs they can offer to the most easily insulted viewers, which for CBC means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and even deadly lame I can not believe it. The presentations are very complicated and end too much, but I do not blame the actors because this kind of stereotypical one-dimensional characters may be exactly what CBC and his students asked for. A very lame show with the bad jokes they tried to make well "controversial" is less controversial than other boring CBC comedy films like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer Report.
