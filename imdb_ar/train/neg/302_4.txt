I really wanted to like this movie. I love Kenny Hotz perfectly, and his Chinny rice aside his enchantment. I do not like Spinney at all. Spiny spoils this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend introduce the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a bit boring away from a scene with Roger Ebert. There are not many celebrities in this movie, and most of them seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would suggest watching it only if you got it with DVD 1 from kenny vs spenny (available for free on the third disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out Papel Chase.
