When I see that I hate reading long articles hoping to find a point and disappointment, I will tell everyone first that this movie was terrible. Definitely terrible. Not surprising for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I might agree with him, seeing that he had given the film his due rank, but was saddened to read what he said. I feel very ashamed to take the same side of someone who commented that the film "definitely lacks beautiful females." Let me be the first to say: "Wow, it was certainly a serious and in-depth review there." My mind can not understand the intellectual understanding of the philosophical reflections on this film. "Seriously, the absence of" beautiful females "should not be considered necessary for a film . If you really need "beautiful females," you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily in the science fiction category.
