"I did not want to believe them at first, but I think that's what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may be falling. After the interesting and surprising monster movie "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") of 2006 - which has already succeeded in making a sharp satire of B-movie class - successive Korean films have become more and more general, even though their budgets (which are spent mainly On special effects) are becoming more and more fascinating. South Korean filmmakers really want to squander all the viewers and investors' intentions, which have been built up since Chery / Swiri in 1999, by producing a whole series of large medium-sized films such as the Chinese mainland. ? {rant end} <br /> <br /> "The only reason" I can understand for making this film is to fool investors into financing the most detailed and smooth digital animation of the Korean / East Asian dragon I've seen so far, for final scenes. Now if they show this dragon at first and give it more personal and purpose, as in the 1996 film "Dragonheart", the film may have a few other amazing qualities other than owning a lot of animated digital dragons. Remember "Dungeons and Dragons" in 2000? Did not anyone know that trick is not how much special effects you use, but how do you use them? I hope there will be more (and better) Korean myths that they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international attention to the myths of the Korean dragon in the way they portrayed this story. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the negative reviews that have passed before and I wonder how the Koreans felt about the existence of the popular anthem "Arirang" in the end. As a creative feature, I would give it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or motion sequences are worth it, but I've seen many video games with better work for the camera and scripts (less Dragons).
