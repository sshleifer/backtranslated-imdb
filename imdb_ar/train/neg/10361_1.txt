This direct failure on ABC television never negates the brilliant fantasy novel Wrinkles in Time. Mrs. Madeleine Lingel brought both children and adults to a magical, imaginative and innovative world like any other author before. This novel, the first of its kind in the "time quartet" is a beautiful story about life, the universe and the same time. However it is easy for any child or teenager to understand. His unshakable morals prevail throughout the book. This film can not be considered a mockery of Ms. Lengel's work. Frankly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot funny and unequal, the dialogue elusive, and lost all the magical property of the novel. This was an awful attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one of the smart directors (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, and Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will one day try another to bring this book to the screen and understand what it is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to the boring, fake and cheap art that has no land and does not affect its audience at all.
