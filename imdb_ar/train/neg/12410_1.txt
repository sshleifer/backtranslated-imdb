This movie was horribly serious. Acting was the worst! It was worse than the student film. Super cheesy, I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, it's an old film. Then I remembered that this is no excuse! I've seen old movies in a better acting way. <br /> <br /> The music was awesome. He was really fickle. The editing was bad (most of the dialog box was asynchronous.) <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not worth even 1. I saw it only because I was so bored, and the movie I hardly enjoyed. It was just funny. My dead left grandmother Pinky toe can make a film better than this.
