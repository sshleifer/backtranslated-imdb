I have rented this thinking may be interesting, and perhaps the story was interesting only to be said in an interesting way. Difficult to follow, strange editing, crumbling crumbs, and mumbling characters, all a waste of time. I could not get into it and I did not care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this film. Unless you need a treat for insomnia, you skip it. 3/10, this being generous.
