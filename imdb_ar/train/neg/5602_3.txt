"Pandemonium" is a parody of a horror film that stems from stupidity rather than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially parody comics. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High An Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of the favorite comedies that displace a certain genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with those movies. Most of the scenes in this film made me sit there dumbfounded silence because the film was not funny. There is little laughter in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh more than a few times, and that's all this movie will get. Geez, "Screaming" was laughing more than this film was more than a horror film. How strange is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
