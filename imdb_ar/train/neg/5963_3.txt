This film begins with the execution of one of the sorcerers and his mistress. He was beheaded and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "the thing that will not die" right? Well, it looks pretty good, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the horrific deaths are done and the film moves very slowly. I mean the length of the film is only 88 minutes and I kept thinking, "When will it end?" The characters in the film are stupid for the most part and they deserve to die because they are really stupid. The villain is also very bad because he moves slowly and really I was wondering how he managed to do anything considering that he was afraid of jewelry. The only thing that makes you see after you install the head is the fact that there are lots of breasts being flashed so that you really start to lose track. I still want to see a horror film, not a soft porn flick and horror film, it's a way to slow motion with lots of slow stretches to be fairly fun. You do not read the back of the box because it shows that there is meat eating zombie attacking the town, there is not ... A small scene in which only three or four zombies attack a house and are easily repelled is not a factor in the film at all and their sight is useless. For the most part, I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it at a really cheap price.
