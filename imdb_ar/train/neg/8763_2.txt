I thought I read somewhere that this was Monogram's last production, but whether it was true or not, it would not matter, because if it was not, it would be. It is a deadly fatal case of John Carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself look like an older scientist trying to help his young trainee Robert Shane bring the dead back to life. Every time they revive their subjects, they seem to have a white face like marble because they lie at the laboratory table (big deal). Karadin manages to bring his faithful dog back to life after his death, and the buster has extraordinary ability to walk through the walls in a ghost-like way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all you write. <br /> <br /> For a very cheap Monogra, this thing uses at least a more fancy laboratory setup than the custom one. The most ridiculous joke in the film is that the "eldest" doctor Carradine consistently refers to his "young assistant" Shayne as a "m'boy" when, in fact, Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they made this!
