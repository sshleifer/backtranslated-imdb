Vulgar, creative dialogue and planning (the same kind of stuff we've seen throughout fantasy movies in the eighties), hokey music, figures of figure paint that eliminates this jogging for everyone but more fanatic hardcore> <br /> What saves this movie from the trash pile is a beautiful crutch From Bakshi's work, endoscopy, the fact that Frank Frazita taught animation how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. The stunning violence and artistic direction and animation do not resemble any other sword and witch film in this period. <br /> <br /> I like watching this sound while turning off the audio music of the first Conan movie instead.
