If you do not realize in the first 10 minutes of this film that the main character, who writes a column of life advice, will get tables consumed and learn some valuable life lessons by himself, then maybe something is wrong with you. The setup can be largely predicted to destroy the film, even if the rest of the movie is good (which is not so). <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the prospective clients, and Steve Karel embarrassing behavior, not funny. It is hard to believe that Pinochet's personality will take care of him. Then in the end, everything is very enjoyable, and everyone lives happily ever after. Is not this great America!
