I saw it at the UCSB pulley festival loudly and was shocked when he won the Golden Pulley Prize. I was not the only person, given that the audience had mixed reactions to the article. I thought there were many other good clicks, but I then learned that the referees were deeply rooted in film theory and other art crap. While cinematography and editing are on par with many short films there, the story's story is no more than the average student piece. "Serious" student films seem to need to include one of these categories: sex, interpersonal struggle, and eventual suicide - both Nick and Kate include all three categories. Please, be more authentic! <br /> <br /> Oh, my mind may be from the outside, but the guy from Monticeto seems a bit fake. Is there anything else?
