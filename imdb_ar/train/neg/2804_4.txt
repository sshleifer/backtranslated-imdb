I might be pissed off because I first saw the 1973 version with Michael Jaston and Sursha Kozak, so the 1983 amendment was a disappointment. I did not get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of representation in acting and acting does not do it for me, and it was all about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. The casting director was actually reading the book. Very strange! He is a good actor but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! Zila was just, well, strange, a combination of a pair of matched. In her favor, the support team was very good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best in adapting, but generally did not pick up any of the novel's charm. Certainly I will not ask anyone to see it as a true adaptation of the novel. Real disappoints!
