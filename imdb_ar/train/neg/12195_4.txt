The plot is not very original. If someone sees "L'ultimo Bacio" there is nothing new. A rich family in Rome lives a dull and boring daily life, where everyone asks others what they think. Really boring after half an hour because it is easy to understand where the story will end. This is because it is easy to see the moral view of Mocheno in this film, so the hardest parts look natural. To sum it up in the first and second minutes of the film, this will be enough and the film's goal has already been said. I saw the family 30 years ago, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality, but to be consistent with its ideas, you have to pay more than normal situations. Really good how to put muccino camera in the right place as it moves with the betters and that is the only reason why i do not sleep in the cinema even though I am always in the film screaming from the beginning. It may be good to see how the family actually is and not to blame something on them. Moranti was intense and great as usual but unfortunately in a bad movie!
