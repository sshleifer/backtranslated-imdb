A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the ability to ... be caught in flames! <br /> <br /> I really prepared for this film, with what Toby Hooper and the great Brad Dorf wild card brought out. Unfortunately, the film did not rise above the level of violent individual forces. Automatic combustion has an interesting hypothesis behind it, unfortunately does not seem to live up to its potential and lengthens its plots too much. Special effects are not bad although they help in moving the film to the finish. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, but Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> Everywhere, it's not a classic but it's not the worst of its kind either. <br /> <br /> ** Out of ****
