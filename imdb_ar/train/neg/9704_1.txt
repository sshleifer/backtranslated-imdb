Well, if you have a few hours to waste, or if you really dislike your life, I'll tell a witness this movie. If anything good for some laughter. Not only do you have obese, aboriginals, but also very bad special effects and may be prohibited in most states. Seriuosly, rating 'PG' is very funny, once you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I will not give this film to my underdeveloped nephew. You can not even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is superficial, clich√©, mute, and stupid. The acting is horrible, and the end is very painful to see that I have already started pumping the salt in my eyes just to take my mind out of the stupidity that fills my TV screen.
