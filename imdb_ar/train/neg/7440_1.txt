I will continue to register because the second person who, after years of using IMDb to search for movies, was motivated by the film Nacho, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. It was the worst film I've ever seen. The plot was almost nonexistent, and no "puzzles" were added in any way. The acting was funny and the writing was embarrassing. How I got support for this film came to be out of my will. The only grace she was able to find was the use of Anastasia Hill's imprecise and repetitive word f. (And a great sound design). If you face the option of watching this movie again or being bored by the wild boulders, I will have a difficult decision. I am disappointed because I cant give it 0 stars.
