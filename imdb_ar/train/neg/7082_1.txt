Well, I wrote a harsh review B / C movie is awful. As I was waiting for another review (for Derrida) for me to pop up, I decided to check out the old reviews of this awful movie. Take a look at all the positive reviews. All of them, I say, are contributors who have not edited any other film other than this one. Crimminy! Wait until you reach the "rosebud" review [sic]. <br /> <br /> Check out other movies reviewed by rosebud and its glowing recommendations. Oh, they shot! , They have encountered other films of the writer and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a book, and Tony, you can not get out of bad text. There are no jobs for you! <br /> <br /> Always check positive comments on a low rating film!
