Damn! What a terrible Spanish film terrible! I passed about four years and finally started the other night. I watched an hour or so before going to bed. I am very intrigued by everything. I finished the order last night and could not believe where I left off the night before. Literally, I stopped it in the second before the movie descended completely. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going, but I stopped it when Simon received the package in a bar. When you pick up the package to detect the laser gun then pick up the "threat" game of the laser marker. Whew! Then the big revelation is that everything is a terrorist plot by playing maniacal roles. Whew! You can say that the Spanish industry was certainly behind director Matthew Gill (a co-author of the two previous big hits). There is an excellent degree and wonderful photography. But this scenario fumes of absurdity. How anyone sat during the past forty minutes with a straight face is something beyond my control.
