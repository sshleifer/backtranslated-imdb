I like special effects and I'm seeing new techniques that make science fiction look real. The special effects of this film are very good. I have seen most of this movie, because it has been aired on HBO for the past two months. I must admit, I have missed some scenes, but I usually go to movies, and I've seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of the "hollow man", I feel depressed, like "Noir Movie" almost. I'm not sure why; maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it only shows how relentlessly it becomes evil. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts are moving slowly), but I do not recommend for young people under the age of 14 (maybe 12, if they are mature).
