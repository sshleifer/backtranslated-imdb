I was very disappointed by this show. After hearing and reading all the fuss about him, how was a "wonderful show" and all kinds of brutal promises if the quality, I tried to watch it. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment !! Representation was a forced and overrated method. The story is meaningless. For any hint of "looking at the lives of teenagers," I have only seen a trivial attempt that has been as real as it appears to be true. <br /> <br /> Some people wonder why many have negative comments about this offer. The reason for this is that it is not really good and that beating the drums on quality in this show only attracts attention to how poorly he performed.
