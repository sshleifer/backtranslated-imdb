Although I do not like to be someone who denies someone else's taste; if you love something, that's fine. But this film was terrible and there was no way to beat it. I do not like Annie DiFranco too much, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter, I can recognize her. But I can not admit that there are any substitutions for this film. Many people the way they are accurate picture of the issues facing high school students. Perhaps, but everything is filmed elusive. There seems to be an attempt at "Naked Gun" - a kind of esque comedy, but the timing is stalled; there's a lot of space between each actor, as if they were being held to laugh (there was not any). Both script writers were everywhere. They tried to put many controversial issues together in one film, and hardly any of them grew up (especially the girl who was vaccinated by a teacher). I did not laugh once throughout this entire film. I felt insulted by this attempt at humor and irony to do anything but roll my eyes on the screen.
