Now, please do not start calling me with names like "non-patriotic", "eccentric" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. No modification at all - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project so much. So Lagaan had a length of 4 hours - but he was fun and gave a message too. <br /> <br /> It depends on real events and real people. His glory, but were repeated scenes of war really required? Moreover, the focus shifts continuously from battalion / squadron to another and was impossible to follow. <br /> <br /> Between skirmishes, there were songs about loneliness, a sense of passion and related things. There were loud conversations. At first, I felt comfortable with the violence but it became so monotonous that one could correctly predict the nature of the next conversation. <br /> <br /> Why were the soldiers roaming around as if they were black in the forest, completely unaware that the enemy was lurking somewhere near? When they were shot, this sympathy aroused, but it seemed unbearable to be very smooth in the first place. <br /> <br /> The music was poor and the songs were affectionate but not suited to the film. It is better to listen to them on the soundtrack than in the film. <br /> <br /> Representation was the sincere grace: veteran veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to the relatively novice Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Khanna, everyone behaved like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention to relieve mood whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> The dialogues between ("Madhuri .. with Love !!") to "irrational" ("Pakistan se seyada" and "Hindu Hindustan Min Hain") ranged from an obscene speech spree consisting of all MCs and BCs The Cs and F-words were not really needed. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to give a good greeting to the brave Indian soldiers, but he tries hard and fails in the end.
