This film is pure nonsense for a film, shown in Japan about a dysfunctional family ending up with a violent stranger sitting behind him and watching the four family members at their worst. There is nothing sacred in this film, where sexual drugs and violence have spread to this extent, and I am surprised by censorship. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it will attract only those who should not be encouraging, rather than any presumed basic message to the rest of us to consider. A film that holds the worst element in society and in any case speaks ... the disappointment of a man who filmed dead or alive films and Odyssey.
