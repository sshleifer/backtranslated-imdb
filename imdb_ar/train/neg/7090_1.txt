I've been sleeping on my couch at 7:35 pm yesterday and I see Larry Sanders (usually I do DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3am (banker investments on the west coast) and were pleased to see it on HBO2. I was shocked at how bad this film was. seriously. I was shocked. I was so shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really really bad. Writing is tedious, but the output and editing are simply less than a beginner's reading at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, he was videotaped. Keep in mind that it was shot on video, not digital video. It looks like a soap opera. Clips from skateboard videos have a more "movie" feeling for them then this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the misdirection but frankly I can not remember anything. The shots and blocking stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid". Not unconventional, not bold, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know that people who review this review will say, "Give me a good example." I could not have been at three in the morning. But trust me, I know you will see it anyway, and it will attract you horrific comments. <br /> <br />
