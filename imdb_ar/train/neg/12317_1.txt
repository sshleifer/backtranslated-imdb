I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. It's a slow film, badly molded and badly behaved, it's trying to escape Romcoms defeated in recent years and failed! It seems that McDonald and Parker are unable to convey true feelings and are lifeless. They seem to be in this account for any paid checks they receive, not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is boring !! I love big chick movies as much as the next girl and this is not the one !! If you avoid one movie this year .... be it
