Since the beginning of this film, you soon realize that the name of the film has nothing to do with the film itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to maids running around in the worst clothes I've ever seen and all this in translation makes this kind of movies you should think about twice about Vision While the movie moves slowly while you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire you have to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film. A little bit of a feeling with Pierre and he is a father but when the film comes to its ridiculous end, you have to think about why the film ended this way and certainly they had a better ending if this movie is not only the viewer mainly
