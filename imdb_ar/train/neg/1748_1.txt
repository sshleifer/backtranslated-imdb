Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a complete crush in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, and soundtrack ... There was such a waste of performance by some very good actors. The film Parish Rawal, who may be one of the most talented actors in Bollywood, does not do justice. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, did a very bad job. John Ibrahim, What's wrong with him? Is this what you call acting? I mean he should thank God that he enjoys a beautiful face otherwise he will win the Razzie Awards in India if there are such prizes in Bollywood. Asrani is a wonderful talent, but he surpasses his ability as before. <br /> <br /> The film's scenario, which was not to mention the rupture of the Boeing company in 1965, was very badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood can not make something original. Moreover, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the film were exaggerated, and it was painful to sit on it. Bryadeshan may be a star in the south, but not suitable for a decent Indian film. Editing the sound is crappy and surprising. I can continue this, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be ashamed of producing such a film. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people seem to like this movie. What's wrong with you guys? That's why Bollywood is its place. Did you know that Bollywood produces more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the films have not been heard from abroad, because movies like this one. I am Indian and I am very ashamed of Bollywood for producing this piece of irritation. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were very impressive. They are world class movies immortal ... among the best in this decade. Garam Masala, however, is probably one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> Give it 1 out of 10.
