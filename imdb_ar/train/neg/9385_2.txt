The Trivia page on IMDb claims that filmmakers protested that the studio had rewritten its story to "streamline the scheme." If so, this effort was a complete failure, as it is one of the most incoherent stories I have ever seen in a film - I hated to see it before it was 'simplified'. <br /> It is sad to see Warren with a very small personality that he can not do anything with incompetent material. It is interesting to see Karon in the 1970s rather than her charming Hollywood costume and personality, but sad to see her husband wander miserably through this pair that works for him. She was actually chasing the filmmaker and marrying him, instead - who would notice that he never directed anything again, but he was quite working on television from here on. This tells you enough there. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic fascination with American films in this period, and this role adds a perspective to the wonderful output of Ots in 1971 (Two - Lin Blaktop, Hand Leased). But "the mabahith in the 1940s was out of the water in the 1970s." The layout, which is the only thing the film should really say, is sold in a very heavy way. A similar theme will be dealt with more effectively two years later in a long farewell. As much as Oates plays the role of a strong man on a failed mission, three years later, his final performance in the film "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" will be given. If you have not seen those, do not waste your time with this!
