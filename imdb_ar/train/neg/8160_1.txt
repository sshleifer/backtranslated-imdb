Not a fun way to watch. It's just bad. It is appalling that people are posting positive things about it here. Suck the story, bad representation, not scary, special effects are not special - Oh no! The blackboard has hands out of them! Hey Jie - turned the mirror into water! Hair, clothes and make-up in the fifties scenes is not accurate, they got a middle-aged man with a retarded hairline playing high school copy himself. This is like a nightmare later on Elm Street stuff. I enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror film like anyone else, but there are bad movies out there to choose from.
