Years after Alex Rayne (played by Olivier Groner in the first film), the terrible conspiracy involving the replacement of humans with machines, has since broken out between cyborgs and humans and has now become a supernatural kind of the daughter of the character of Olivier Greiner Half its minimal acting ability) which I think is a little related to the first, but when superheroes are created in 1980 while a hunter hides a grant from the future in this confusing science fiction clunker. Nemesis has become a successful hit, where I can see why people are impressed even though I was not a fan of the movie. Nemesis tried very ambitious to come up with different ideas and develop a beautiful appearance and save a lot of actions, I've almost succeeded. Nemesis 2 does not have this ambition; it is a cheap rupture with The Terminator with a young, low-acting woman who makes Olivier Gruner look like a major character, and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the basis of the original selling point. I will admit that I was not a parent lover but it deserves a better follow up from this. The original version also includes an impressive collection of actors such as Tim Thomerson, Carrie Hiroyuki Tagawa, Tom Matthews, Bryon James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earl Haley. This movie does not expose anyone, this time just a boring film with an amazing atmosphere. In fact after seeing it, I was inspired to add a half star to the original. <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
