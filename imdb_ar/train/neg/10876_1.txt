What the hell did De Film have that? Bad behavior, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / story I have ever come across. The only wonderful thing here was the Coolio, who had a beautiful veil as a terrifying policeman. However, the rest of the film is awful and boring. It's not too bad, you can laugh at it. Just plain crap. Anyone who compares this to Evil Dead Series may compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, well, at least Angelina Jolie was in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
