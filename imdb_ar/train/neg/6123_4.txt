When I was a teenager I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best films ever produced. Of course, the reason for this is that Derek Bo and her various cases of undress in this film. However, now that I have grown up, I can honestly say that this film is horrific. Keep in mind that Bo Derek is very beautiful and she and her husband John Derek make sure to see plenty of them. But when you take this side of the film, it becomes a big boring journey. And Tarzan, well, they are all like you, as you think it should be, but when Jane (this is Bo, of course) sees for the first time, he does not know what to think. This is despite the fact that Bo wears a shirt wet with his head, with the appearance of her chest prominently. Tarzan will be the only primitive man on the planet who will face this problem. If you are looking for a movie that is wearing a beautiful nude body, this ticket may be filled. If you're looking for a thoughtful, entertaining movie and worth it, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else!
