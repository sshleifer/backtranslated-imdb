no I'm not joking. If they have suggested a movie before, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are quite similar in every film, they consist only of traveling to foreign places, facing a problem that is easily solved, hoping to be popular, and getting new friends. think about it. If you've ever seen a movie with a different plot, call me and tell me his name. These "films" are bad excuses for television and go to other countries. There is a reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure they were when they were really young and they made some of O.K. Movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now, they, 17, can produce films in other countries when they want to use studio money. Let me advise you, stay away from Mary Kate and Ashley! It's for your own good!
