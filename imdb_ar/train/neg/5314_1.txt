The music that overwhelms the nerves like fingernails on the blackboard, which is very similar to the fact that it was a shame to miss actors by not producing a second film; portraying everyone as real zombies --- with the charming actress Sabrina the hero of the heroes ... A film so difficult that if the "jewelers" are still around it, they may be considered a cult film --- but, oh very amateur, the scripts may have been carried around by actors, read their lines and mingle slowly in the film --- Boolean style subdivisions Los Angeles, props directly from ToysRus! Was this movie ever that totally and completely incompetent ?? Logic moves to the wind in this weightlessness, meaningless and meaningless and with a stupid and uncoordinated "monster" so much that it can not be hit by a turtle in an icebox --- lowcut, long legs --- and Amazon! Keep my attention all the way through; the way that a terrible and continuous series of accidents in a fog that includes multiple vehicles keeps one watching until the end ... as after a silly gun battle in a prison on another planet, Sexy warhead and mentally imbalanced chasing evaders from the fugitive land --- to the ground! Do not let anyone on popcorn, you might enjoy watching this game. This is bad!
