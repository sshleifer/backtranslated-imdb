"Meatball Machine" should be one of the most ridiculous, horrifying and outrageous horror films I have ever encountered. It is a good idea of ​​evil and an upcoming tale, with the aim of entertaining with bloody context, corruption and humor. Because of that, the violence is not particularly outrageous and does not make you feel bad, but the unjustified bloodshed and nudity is working freely. The performance of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst I've ever seen. If that's not enough, it's also directed by an unnamed director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie contains just about everything, it's bad for the bone! , You should watch it for every maniac with b-movie !!! ... Simply put: a fun and rare gem.
