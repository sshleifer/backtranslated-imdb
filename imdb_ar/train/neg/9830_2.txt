I am afraid to find that the vast majority of people who classify this film as 10 people are very Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll need to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> You have been disturbed by characters and their irrational behavior. The premise of the film is that teaching morality without teaching that Jesus is the basis of morality is the same mistake. One of the main scenes of the child tells us that it is wrong to steal, and the character continues to say that Jesus taught us that. I find this attack: do we believe that "you do not steal" came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? The theft was acceptable before that? I have rented the movie from Netflix. The nature of the film should have been recognized by the comments. Oh, okay.
