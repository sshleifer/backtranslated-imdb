I present the student was forced to watch this movie in the chapter, and what came out of him was the blatant bias involved in the film. The film is clearly tilted toward P.O.V. Of their "shared deaf perception" is not a middle ground. Also, the film is not mentioned or takes into account other positions that are also under discussion in this topic. Which. Deaf people who were born and heard and then deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? The film is biased and almost all in the opinion of the deaf with the capital "D". This is not a bad thing, but to be a real documentary is to try to be a little biased.
