I'm sorry for Jan, having a good original movie to be followed is probably his worst film in his career. This movie was dropped terribly because of the horrible acting functions performed by Goldbeg (Romeo) and whatever the name of this computer. Also, some scenes may be just a little immoral. Really, a bad film.
