The first one was a giant rat mainly, but there were some wasps and giant chicken too. This one, however, is only a period of giant mice, as well as giant mice and a really small growing boy. This person revolves around this growing boy and the world who is trying to help him create giant killer mice ... you know how she is. This film contains some murders and moments, but I find it on the same level as the original film, but I prefer somewhat in the films of the giant creatures. Well, that's not true ... I really like "Empire of the Ants", maybe I do not care about giant rodents. All in all a fairly awesome movie even though it contains one strange twist to the events in this dream sequence really strange. I just can not recommend this.
