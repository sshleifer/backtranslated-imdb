... There is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to see him last night. It's just a small theater, but usually there are quite a few people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The film was one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. Representation, texts, dialogue, guidance, editing, etc. Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the film. That is, we talked about how bad it was, and reminded us of the powerful morphine forces of Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal and the Lord of the Rings. It was as if we expected to see Rita and Lord Zeid portraying the commanders of the Suron Army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were silly. You can not only offer hordes of dino / dragon / lizard objects loaded with guns without explanation. The Lord of the Rings contains a wide range of characters, but it presents and develops on 3 films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The landscape shifts are horrific. I was not asleep during the film, but although it was a very simple plot, I found myself being lost in the plot openings. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but I spoke with almost broken English because of the poorly written dialogue box. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have restored the movie's value failed ... Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... although he did not know her for a long time during this life anyway. He did not look very upset about his leaving at the "Murdor" and did not know where he was or how he came back. We could not love God to see where he was or how he got there too, but if he was not upset, we would not be. <br /> <br /> Oh, why did the dress wear that Sarah's soul was wearing as if borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One last thing ... All three main characters of the hero are the reincarnation that was brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her mission and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this too. Then why is Ethan getting drunk? I have left a lonely, without girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him return. What was he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? If he returned home, did he return to his job? He should have received the same mercy of the murder of the film as other heroes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money in this movie. We stayed up to the end because we paid for it, but once the credits arrived, we were out the door.
