A common horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn hides the gates to hell. It reminds us of the "tenant" in Polanski (released a year ago "The Sentinel"), but far from the Polish director's film in any possible way. The "tenant" was very troublesome, while the "guard" was not at all. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising than this film is the crew: it is full of wonderful names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Walach), veteran actors acting for food (I think). <br /> <br /> Judgment: It's hardly amusing. My rate: 4/10
