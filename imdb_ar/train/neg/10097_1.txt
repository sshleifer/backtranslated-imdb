I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie clicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheese, the representation will be substandard, and the collections will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But it must be at least a story. The stories cost nothing but time ... Apparently, they did not have any time either. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had a zombie 5 appeared near the end of the movie, all resembling new wave prostitutes. The zombie image appears on the front cover of NEVER in the film. It was very painful to watch and he had nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> Running time is only 81 minutes but it sounds like two hours. According to my wife (who only heard the movie because it was on the computer in another room), it looked like a pornographic zombie .... if you think about it, it looks kinda gross ..... but it was not even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that perhaps the author tried to do a lot of things and ended up with an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I have classified it as one out of 10 because IMDb will not allow me to use decimal fractions.
