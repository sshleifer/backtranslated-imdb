There are two points I need to clarify at first. First of all, we all know what Oscar this year really was all about this year. It was the academy's way of showing people that they were not racists, and they had not done it before. They wanted to erase all the prejudices about themselves. Second, it makes no sense to make observations about the offer, because in fact, what difference will it make? But, it's fun to write about. This is the year when Oscar is fed up! I will not see the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crow wins "Gladador" when the real winner is Ralph Finis for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, review and approve it. "Wide eyes shut down" when no nominations received. As far as this year goes, well, the bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lorman does not get the best director! are you kidding!! "Beautiful Mind" is up to the "best make-up" ??? "Training Day" gets nominated ?? The film was terrible, and it seems that Washington has not performed, as it has proved, it knows how to use four words! This is what won the prize for! Take away the language and bet it was almost playing! I liked the "Gosford Park", I've already done, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth they could not give it Altman too! I mean, come on, if there's only giving the prize to people to explain any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and not Oscar! There were so many things that bothered me about the Oscars this year, but I'll live with them, as long as I do not have to watch another show again! The highest point (and only one) of the show was when Woody Allen appeared for the first time ever to the awards exhibition. This will go down as one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
