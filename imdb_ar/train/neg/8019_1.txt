Read half a dozen of other users' comments in this forum, and opinions seem to vary greatly. I must agree with those who found that this film is very bad. It hurts me to write that since I wished it was great, or it would not bother me to see it that day. I like to support independent cinema, especially if its theme is gay, but this film is almost possible. Those who came out, as I was thinking of doing so after about three minutes, probably did not mind shelling $ 11.00, or thought it was not anywhere, quickly, and would not improve. Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic than they are ... either this or not paying for entry in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan feels bored. It's Clutz. He's gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that the main character in the movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the film about it must be boring too! There are endless scenes for this child who walks around like a load of laundry, re-establishing all that I have already learned in the first scene, the second scene, etc., etc ... None or no one goes anywhere. No one says anything even remotely insightful, funny or interesting. Perhaps the most shocking thing is that I did not feel the slightest sympathy for Logan. This in itself is a great achievement. Did not grow, did not change, did not learn (no one knows him anything), did nothing, did not do the film! The scene after a scene is the same as a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title makes no sense at all. 10/01.
