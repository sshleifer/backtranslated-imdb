I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of nonsense. This film is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid, the representation is modest and the film is boring. I do not know why Wes hated Craven for the first time "Another House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of this kind and he likes (maybe) this turkey. Do not get me wrong, I really like some of his movies, but it was real torture while sitting and watching these.
