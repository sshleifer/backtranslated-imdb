Rarely moved to comment online about a movie. But I do not understand how I got this one. Who made it? How can they think they can produce a feature film? Did they take a weekend course at a movie school, got a big check from the father and kidnapped the David Bedell family one after the other until he agreed to be there? Or was he in any case a friend of a distant family / relationship far away doing so with the excuse of misplaced pity? I do not care, do not want to know. He even seems quite embarrassed by his presence, as he lines the lines and hides his face from the camera. At the same time, DOP must be dirty from neighbors, and there seems to be no sound design at all, and the text, direction, and editing were all very bad, and quite frankly, the indifference that now engulfs me means I can not bother Most of my life is thinking about this film.
