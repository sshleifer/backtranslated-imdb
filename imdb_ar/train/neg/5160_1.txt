You get a gift. It's beautifully wrapped. The box is hand-made from the finest wood and shows skill even to the smallest detail. Then it is wrapped in exquisite paper, handmade and hand-painted by most talented artists. Everything is wrapped in ribbons made of fine lace and silk. It's a sight to see. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the tape, tear the paper, open the box, and search for ... nothing. This is playing. You can enjoy packing or forgetting. <br /> <br /> The film is not without its purpose and purpose: war is not good. Well, is not this the original! The moral is so obvious that it is embarrassing to point out. Even that weak insight is undermined by a story in which the elements of war - war games in particular - are clearly bad, until you need an exciting climax and the film simulates war using innocent games. It seems like someone preaching a strict sermon, just to end up saying "just joking." <br /> <br /> But even when the box is empty, the film fails to scrutinize. Yes, it is a scene that can be seen with some wonderful and amazing images. Creative groups and cinemas are cleverly catching colorful scenes. But the pictures are cool and emotionally emotional. Like the film's screenplay, the film's appearance is happy, sometimes barren and surreal. It's a film that wants to praise games as great and special, but it shows that they are creations for an empty and cool world. The film seeks to be funny, in a misguided manner, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the heir to the empire of the game industry, is thinking in his mind, which seems strange only to the strange and orderly world of the cold he inhabits. In fact, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendos that are spreading all over are dangerously contradictory with the childish myth the film tries to obscure. In order for this movie to work, or be logical, it must be set in being your own, which is Oz away from Kansas. Every time jokes bring us back to the ground, the land of the film is increasingly a clear bluff. <br /> <br /> It is said that this was Barry Levinson's pet project, a project he was trying to get for 10 years. It is obviously sad why he had a problem getting support. Like most recent pet projects (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: being a great example on earth), it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's vision. Perhaps Levinson directed Toyz and often redirected him in the head so that he did not have a new vision when he finally reached the acoustic stage. He had already mastered him to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the games shown in the movie are clumsy, mechanical and arduous monsters. So is the film itself.
