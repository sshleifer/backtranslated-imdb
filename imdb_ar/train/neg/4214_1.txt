After having wasted only two hours watching this and 80% of that time in total disbelief, I can give this rubbish Turkey's award for the year, no problem. To say that the plot was unbelievable is some great understatement. Frankly I am lost to words to describe such absolute ideals. It's not just characters and no similarity to originality (this kind of thing was much better in dozens of "serial killers") but the acting was terrible. For those who pay for it, I hope you recover your money, and those who have been paid to do so, hope to recover your money. Believe me there are many new versions that there are much better. Go to see.
