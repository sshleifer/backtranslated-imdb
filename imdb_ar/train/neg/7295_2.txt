First of all, the reason I give this movie two stars instead of 1 is that Peter Falk has at least made his usual remarkable performance as a Lieutenant Colombo. He can only get 10 stars to try and save this useless attempt at all to make a movie. <br /> <br /> I was initially driven by reading a poster comment that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "his career performance." To me, it was the bad performance of Stevens that completely destroyed this film, so I was all ready to throw All kinds of insults to the person who made the said comment. Then I thought to myself, What did Stevens do? So I checked, you know, that this person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since the production of this Colombo film, each of the 33 projects where Stevens has been working since then seems to have been completely bullshit, so it is doubtful that anyone has seen the rest of his career. <br /> If you like Colombo, check out all 69 other titles before watching this title. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for another.
