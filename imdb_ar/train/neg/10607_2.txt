Jean-Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by completing the World Soldier. But did this film save him? I think he goes to hell, after his death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see inside the facility, where you can see the bad guy in the movie. Scary, huh? But not as scary as acting (details below). <br /> <br /> Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (do not remember the name ... well, it does not matter anyway), try to escape some muscle men. Of course they are the new world soldiers. More muscle, less brain (just like the film). After a while, van Dam Goldberg fights but then the "mission" is thwarted. It was just a test (does this film test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government in the new Universal Soldier project (who saw the first film might think that was the most irrational thing, the character yould Van Dammes could do). But it is a sequel The "story" must come. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about shutting down and abandoning the project. Of course the cube is angry and all the soldiers are active to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers to look for him (wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). Guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who has always been a silly penalty to the public before being harassed. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "story", Van Dam tries to rescue his wife (his wife - the reporter in the first film). It's about a final show where Van Damme fights Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene from the entire movie (see yourself, it's very funny to tell). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So you do not see it. But if you do, keep a sixpack with you!
