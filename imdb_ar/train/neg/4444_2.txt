Dr. K (David H Hickey) tries to master a formula that ends all diseases and disabilities, but he needs live donors to complete his work. His brother, Doctor Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Phillips) and is acceptable in medical school. Eddie has a friend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is before the law and plans to attend the same law school next fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sara calls things up with her current friend, who also hates Lady Walt (Bill Sebastian; Eddie's best friend who recently paid for the usual job of his girlfriend Cheating). Eddie accidentally bumps into a car and shows the pain of death when Dr. K presents a proposal to Richard ... to "recover" Eddie using his illegal methods. When Dr. K applied his serum to Eddie, he had terrible consequences. Eddie's face leads to the bulging of large warts while also gaining a taste for human flesh. Many will die so Eddie can feed this appetite that is uncontrollable and can not extinguish it. Soon he may pose a threat to his father and girlfriend .. You must stop Eddie Munster. <br /> <br /> The immediate horror of the video is a severe lack of budget, representation and overall talent. The premise, which looks like an interesting fear, fails to deliver even in the form of a coma. The bull is limited to some chewing scenes but most of the violence occurs outside the camera. Using time to move the story can be really annoying.
