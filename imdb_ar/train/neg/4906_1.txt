Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously this was a film-making, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but it seems that anything before or after it was a painting by the type of film. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry among investigators of lovebirds. .. <br /> <br /> I would like to dig deeper, but this film does not really deserve it. Class: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
