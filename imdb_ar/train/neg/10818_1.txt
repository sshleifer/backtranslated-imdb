After reading the novel before watching this film, I was very disappointed by the wooden representation and the vanity of the producers in their blatant disregard of the scheme. I feel that this film does not in any way reflect Bronte's brilliance, but gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the intensification of the film for two short hours, the film has several key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a fairly fast plot with little grounding. There is no correlation between romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it seems surprising and unfounded because the two people have frequent interactions that you can not help but imagine that their "love" is superficial. This is unfair in Bronte's novel; you do not leave an impression of the exotic cheek and gin that attracts Rochester to her, and of her arrogance that attracts Jean to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the weakness of scripting that a few very cool characters were filmed, namely Ms. Fairfax and Grace Paul, but the production was generally bad. In the light of writing better, the film may have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zila Clarke and Timothy Dalton for a terrific production.
