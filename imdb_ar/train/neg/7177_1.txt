Since I liked the original "Caligula" even with all its flaws, I must say that the new reproduction clip was poor. <br /> <br /> Listen to Jovovich say in that broken American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I feel sick. The group does not look Roman at all ... looks like the courtyard of the Hollywood Palace of the rich actor, Roman fashion looks like cheap crap you buy at a suburban fashion shop. <br /> <br /> This "magician" Adriana Asti looks like a 50-year-old Hispanic woman completely terrified of her mind, as if she does not know it's a movie. <br /> <br /> Representation must be the worst I've ever seen, with most lines I hear being random actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" Loud and as far as possible. <br /> <br /> Random sex has also filled a good 40% or 50% of the trailer, and viewers with prominent actors / actors such as Gerard Butler (who oversees the screen in the shadows every three and a half seconds) do nothing but search for Rest or move to the top with its lower lines, just drag it down with the absurdity of its delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney's Love part consists of her looks like a whore having a bitch crack leaning against the door buzzing around the moon or something. You can not tell if they are drunk, high or just giddy. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is annoying ... laughs randomly and screams in a way that bothers you. <br /> <br /> Helen Mirren ... Originally, her return to Caligula was composed of ... I especially "love" (and love, I mean hatred) line Ennia, "Caligola ... j00 no maki me * something incoherent * * something that looks like j00nalo * "as he is too arrogant to say four Caligula was a year larger than the birth of Jesus and his death. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this must be the worst, most exploitative, and stupid part of the stupidity called "art" that I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not appear or give his name in exchange for this meager heap, no matter how much they paid him (unless 1 trillion yen). Worst trailer ever.
