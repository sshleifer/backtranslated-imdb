Two older men sit on a lawn bench. I do not really have a problem with this scene - the only problem is that it's not a scene, it's the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Yup did not get a low concept of this. They are no longer duller than this either, but there is something to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Nate Muir, a Yediothian, and the other is Midge Carter, a former gold glove champion, also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a lawn bench go well. Well, I think this is possible, although it is unlikely, but if this film has a non-aggressive scenario, why play the stereotype of Judaism? Why do we make them wear loud pastoral trousers that divide the Hebrew right? Ironically, the Jews who were seen at the beginning of the film are exactly the kind of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The stereotypes set aside by Moi Dyers in the "I'm not Rapaport" problem are that " s written for the meduim quite different from the cinema, it 's based on a play and shows Walter Mattau walks through his role as a Nat child while sleeping this suspense in almost the entire film
