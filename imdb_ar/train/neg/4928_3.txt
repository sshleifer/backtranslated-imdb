This romantic adventure must have seemed devastating in its day. A wealthy woman of the English upper class conspires and plans and manipulates all around her for her satisfaction. It uses its privileged location to embark on covert anti-social activities. There is an intelligent reflection of the role of sex because its activities have proved to be bolder and more disruptive than most male characters. But it is normal to have a long dark handsome handsome man to keep the interest of love, this evil lady is not lagging behind in progress when you meet the right man. All other characters make the plot unconvincing at the extreme, but those who crave romance will ignore it.
