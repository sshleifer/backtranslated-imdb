First viewing 12/7/2002 - 3 of 10 (Abbey Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with some kisses. It seems to me that the girls are fed up with these things and it would be interesting to see what happens to them if they decide to break up and go there in special ways. In this episode of their adventures, they are trained in Rome for a "fashion" designer who puts them right in the post room to find out about the hard work (I think ..). In addition to the usual spinners with the boys, there is nothing other than the Rome scenario until the film is finally reached when it is finally revealed why they were released, then reassigned, then released again, then reassigned. This is certainly done by people who do not understand the corporate world and this is reflected in their interpretation of it. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure (if there is an adventure). Even my children do not seem to care about this boring "adventure" in making ideas. Let's see they probably only have a few years until legitimate adults. We will see what happens next.
