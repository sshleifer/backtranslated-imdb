I had great hopes for this film. The theater monologue is wonderful and Nic Balthazar is a very sexy man, and he has a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I admire a lot of Belgian films, but this is a bad film. It is inconceivable that the 34-year-old actors play the role of teenagers suddenly. The "language games" were abhorrent and on top. Nothing about the film seemed real to me. The end was a very bad way for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think I have wasted an hour and a half of my life.
