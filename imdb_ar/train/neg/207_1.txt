This is a 90-minute Ramon concert with short periods of stupidity and sheer boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of the main Ramones, do not repeat and do not waste your time as you did. This can not be accessed from start to finish. This film should be called the Ramon fever. Everyone seems to like them in this film. There is no plot to be found in this flick. As far as you go teen comedy, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.
