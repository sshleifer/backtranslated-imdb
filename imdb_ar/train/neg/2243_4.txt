They are not even worth a review, other than warning potential viewers. It is a fairly general ghost story about an actress chasing Estudoa while filming World War II drama. There is no fear of participation, no suspense at all, no surprises. One dreadful moment looks a little silly so do not be shocked. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there are some really wonderful adjustments one by one. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a full statue. 10/04.
