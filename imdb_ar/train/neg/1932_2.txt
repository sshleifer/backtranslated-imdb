If the Atlantis makers have what you say in this film, its theme (literally) has drowned by focusing on "special effects" on the characterization. Almost as if to try to "keep up" with the rest of the summer motion films, Disney abandoned the film-driven style with a message in favor of "Star Wars" with protagonists of stereotypes and villains. <br /> <br /> Art is a carton and producers believe they can count on computer generated images (CGI) for a fishing plane and submarines to bridge the gap. They are wrong, and the beautiful cartoon days fly quickly from the window to the CGI assembly line. <br /> <br /> This movie is heartless. Sometimes the film is close to being a good and interesting film, but it disappoints many times by stopping talking about something meaningful and choosing instead to go to the front. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the movie is speed. It starts confusingly and then begins to fire the missile with the method of editing an unpredictable and volatile story. The scenes were moved from the door alongside Milo Thatch (well expressed by Michael J. Fox) and left him thinking "There must be a lot of things to happen as soon as we get to Atlantis." Unfortunately, not much happens. Atlantis secret remains secret with storytellers who do not really know how to interpret the legendary island / continent. They are afraid to speak of the place of Atlantis, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean? Who do you know? Nothing is assumed, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theater and ask himself, "Now what was everything?" What was the point of view of the film? Why could not the surviving Atlas remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster until the present day and why Atlantis sinks? Forgetting what they saw ... there is nothing left to think about or overcome ... except for the loss of money in their wallets. <br /> <br /> The characters and their motives can not be understood alike: from the eccentric billionaire who founded the campaign with more money than what It seems to have existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the collective consciousness (spoiler) which enters KIDA and VOLUNTARILY corrects the Poet The crew is a group of twisted two-dimensional people from an anachronism (1914) PC race and sex The demolition expert talks like he came out of Warner Bros. Short Bunny. It's hard to believe the way these players support moral transformation near the end of the film. <br /> <br /> While we salute Disney for trying to create adult movies - this is Disney's first game Do not have nice animals or things to talk about - they fail to move. Young children will be afraid of some movement scenes and left in the dark because of the large number of translations (when the characters speak of the Atlantic). In the first five minutes of the campaign, nearly 200 people were killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you do not know who these people are, why should you care? Again, the film has no feelings at any level. <br /> <br /> Mulan and Tarzan were Disney's latest animated films, which were very well executed. Unfortunately, Atlantis returns to those failed attempts in the past, such as the black boiler and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to return to their roots. Peter Pan is coming up soon but nobody knows what the results will be until you see them yourself. Now that Disney has discovered science fiction, one hopes to realize that this genre has to be more than a spectacle. We also hope that Treasure Planet, a scientific adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson's Treasure Island, is more passionate about Atlantis: The Lost Empire.
