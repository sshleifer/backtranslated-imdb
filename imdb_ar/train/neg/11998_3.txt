This is a terrible terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all TOOO. The longest film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> All the stories were "too damn" !! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many stories in the story. The line is devastating. <br /> <br /> comedy was not comedy !!!!! It was not funny at all .... <br /> <br /> The story was disgusting and badly written so it did not matter whether the characters were living or dying. I had some expectations of this movie ......... but my expectations were completely stopped in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is music .... .. It is clear Vidya Palan. It offers the best performance and stands out among all the great actors ... It is just a newcomer yet it shines and makes the rest of the team members look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the Blonde, who plays his love, also helps save this disastrous film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of taxi driver. And The Blonde also offers hidden and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> Another talented actress Aisha Taqiya is totally lost in this movie !!!! So Priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay performs well but looks too much !! Anil and my soul are totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only person who has not lost is Salman because he has no talent and never gets lost !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> All in all this is a very impossible film with Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar that the story is formed according to stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 It's four hours long !!!! Think and rethink before going to the cinemas !!!!! Best avoid it !!!!!
