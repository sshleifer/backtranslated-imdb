What an absolute pile of pants. After reading Chris Brockmeer's books since she came across a book "Very Ugly ...", I was thrilled to discover that this drama was commissioned. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I have a lot of faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing about this show - and it's not quite right. How anyone can read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of slag is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Entire characters have been changed, positions are dropped, watching Parlablane's dramatic intrusion into Nesbitt's quick chin and sliding open bay window ... brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> You are scared to think about what will happen with the "blind country" if this is the standard ... <br /> <br /> Please, just avoid it ...
