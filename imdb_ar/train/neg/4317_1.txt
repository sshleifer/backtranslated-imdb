My wife & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started good, but soon got incredible and silly. Most of the acting was poor, except for the little girl Abby who was really wonderful. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, The Angel's. Also, without giving up anything, when a character has a tragedy, they seem almost indifferent. At first we thought it was a "shock", but then we realized it was just a terrible scenario. We love almost all of Hallmark's films and hot stories, but this film does not amount to being one. There are so many wonderful things - do not waste your time with this terrible movie.
