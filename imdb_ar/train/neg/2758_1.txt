I give this movie number 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. This movie was terrible. It was a very bad behavior, the story was poorly written, and the procedure was incredible. I doubt that the Salvation Army might be in a bad fight as the troops did in this film. I will not write any spoilers because the film is not good enough for the spoilers of the plot. Writing comments on the plot would be meaningless. If I compare this film, I will have to compare it to "Rain of Fire", but although I did not like "Rain of Fire" too, at least this film was better than this film. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater left before the movie ended. The only reason I did not do it was that I simply did not think about doing it. I was hoping for a CGI day and fighting brilliantly, but that's not what happened. Martial arts continued every 30 seconds and this was done through an exercise done during the rear flash scene, which is very disappointing. CGI was not too good. One scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank battles, the troops fired at ... ... nothing. Someone forgot to refer to the youth of animation on this part of the film, so the street was completely empty of bad guys. I also think that the bad guy's voice was called Imotep from The Mummy. This same thing was repeating a conflict going on. (Someone deserves some royalties, here?) Ever since I mentioned the scene of fighting, I would say yes can be considered a spoiler, but only to the extremists I suppose. <br /> <br /> Do not go to watch it, do not buy a DVD when it comes out as well. You have been warned.
