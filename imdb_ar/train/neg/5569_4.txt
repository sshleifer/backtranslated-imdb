I've tried to love this movie, really. In watching him, all I can think of is: "This guy gives me creeps, I'd get a restraining order." It also calls the code in uppercase letters. Was this conversation really before the film was made? "Let's make a film that puts two people with chronic depression and social incompetence in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" What I have seen in life is that the last thing on Earth we find in a potential companion is the constant compassion on the soul. The mood of the film is clearly 80. The brood is slow, do not make mistakes, the film has moments, only a few of them.
