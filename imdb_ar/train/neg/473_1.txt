This is what my friend Brian said about this film about an hour later. He could not keep away from the drought. I was annoyed about how wonderful this was and finally I started playing it, after I ran out of "boring" status. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you like, peak penetration action. Nothing too inspiring, so terrible, so that all you want to do after watching it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this film is movable. Not so, not under any form of drug or brain damage. I would only recommend this to someone in order to help him understand how truly unbearable. Do not believe me gathered. <br /> <br /> As a country, we in America have not always portrayed the peoples of the Middle East in a delicious way. But what about a child in an old-fashioned robe kneeling peacefully into a pile of Castrol oil bottles? You'll find it here. Get it? Arab worship oils. I could not believe what I was seeing. Making a child fly in a skyscraper would be more convenient. Who in their right mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "smart attack". It just sucks and makes you want to hit the push to write this thing in your face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of five men called "Landmines" took the stage in the Officers' Ball. Well, are you ready? The humor is that she sings terribly and externally. Why did you write this in hats too? Because the joke is a pound, pound, it's rolled into your head with a marathon of terrible gags. They start from average enough. Cracking glasses, punch tumblers crashing ... then there, I'm 100% serious, sequence stop motion two frame for woman SHOES OFFING OFF. You read it properly - the music was so bad, under one, my feet were on the woman's shoes. In the next shoe - the boots are extinguisher !!! Get it, because the music was so bad, I got out of my shoes! What is F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless montage of stock shots to push the house to the point where the BAD sings. If anyone actually suffers through this scene in the theater without jogging like hell, I would be surprised. This film is frankly like a practical joke to see how quickly people get out of doors. Robert Downey's father directs comedy in the way his son is respected by staying drug-free. in a bad manner. Other things to watch out for: 1. Popular music that has been crammed anywhere. Each time the Liceman appears, the Iggy Pop song is played really indecent. In addition to that all actors are doing their best to act as if they were really cool for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbra Bach's criminal tone is awful. She looks as if she is trying to talk like a child while rolling on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are many scenes where children moan and write a glimpse of their schism, as if they were in a classroom in a community school, and they were directed to act like frightened retarded people. <br /> <br /> 3. Litman feeds his sexy condom. Remember, when this movie came out he was throwing "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "agitated". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Boston is an idiot of hungry young children, when Hollywood thought that "pedophiles" and "homosexuals" were identical. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the end. There is nothing wrong with your VCR. This is indeed the end. Tell me that this does not make you want to blow up anyone making any movie at all. <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk. It is known that Up Academy is already making other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, which are less funny simply by putting the video near them.
