"Friend", clearly without taste or class, suggested to look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his boss, I do not want to see anything else before him. It's amateurish, self-indulgent, shaky, poor and self-mad. "The Desperate Whore" is an angry, low-budget filmmaker who kills a handful of prostitutes. There is little nudity and some erections, but there is no single element that can save this from the hangman's rope. The lighting is appalling, the childish dialog box is often screaming, and the direction is clueless. I saw a document about the American exploiters during the last Fangoria conference. Atkins was one of those distinguished. He spoke as if there was something important about his work, but after showing this, I see nothing at all. There is no style either, and the terrible video effects (like sunbathing) only increase the strength of the amateur. Not so bad it's fun. Avoid.
