Seeing all the negative reviews of this film, I thought it could be another comic masterpiece that was not supposed to be. I saw the first scenes of fighting, listened to the public dialogue that was terrible by Lungren, and all the other eastern actors, and found the film so awful that it was fun. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the contestants begin to fly, the plot collapses, the scriptwriter starts drinking, and the film ends with a welcome, because it turns into the worst film ever. <br /> <br /> Lungren has surpassed his previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all Van Damme films, Seagal movies and Stallone non-rock movies, for this outstanding honor. This film has the worst representation (see Tia Carrere when in any scene with Dolph, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment about Little Dolph is the worst line ever in a movie) Dolph in full Japanese costume). The picture "Tango and Cash" with the worst representation, meets with "Commando" and meets "Friday 13th" (due to the nudity and meaningless performance of Lungren is very similar to Jason Voorhees), in an hour-and-fifteen minute joke of the film. Good performances (what about not terrible) go to the bad guy (who still seems to be holding through his entire performance) and Carriere (who tells her somehow five lines without laughing). Brandon Lee is just my friend Lungren, and he does a very terrible job at it. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. I fear and avoid it. If you're watching it, ask yourself why underwater shots are as clear as most non-submerged shots. Talk about underwater shots and check out a lame water battle scene with the worst fighting scene ever ending. This film contains every version of a bad fight scene for those who span their attention briefly and fill up between nudity flashes. <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
