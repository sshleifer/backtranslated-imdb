I read James Hawes' book. It was very stylish, not great, but amusing enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea what was going on and were still with that knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally, every element of this film is very sad in ways I do not do. They have the ability to describe. Half-digested fish could have made a better film using matches and soft lipstick. <br /> <br /> I've never been angry about a film like that. The rank ranks approached, but they never reached these depths of sudden panic just as this age did. <br /> <br /> Since wasting 90 minutes of my life I have seen this plague on a human kind, I can not yet see any book of James Hughes without feeling angry. This is the depth of my hatred for this piece of sh * t. No, this is unfair. Let me apologize for every fecal issue of your comparison with the other earthly evil of Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple cancer in the world of cinema.
