The film contains only one flaw, and unfortunately this defect hurts all credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> He begins by condemning the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. He failed to address the reason for the Israelis' existence. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. For this reason, Israel "occupies" its territory, because those countries lost it in a war that began. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel defied the United Nations in its non-compliance with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was immediately rejected from its inception by the Palestinians, making it null and void. <br /> <br /> Many movies are put together well, and they can really show mind-altering footage, but remember, when you see anything, do not believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film are known to be critics of Israel, some of whom have made public anti-Semitic comments, removing any possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants need a real historical lesson that is being taught objectively, not by some Palestinian sympathizers.
