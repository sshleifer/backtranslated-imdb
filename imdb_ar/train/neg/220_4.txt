"The Crush" is a romantic chick enough for 40 friends, for the first two thirds or so, because he tries to be Brit "Sex and the City." <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed playing a large piece of young cups that did not embody her personality much (think to you, we have not seen all that physical body of him, and Kenny Dutty is worth seeing more of). <br /> <br /> It certainly makes a lot of young people / older women bigger than the opposite in any version of Sabrina (I do not like the movie) or in this regard with Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Svengalis nuptials. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell is surrounded by his former compatriots, but is accepted by British drama and comedies, such as Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot leading to the end runs very, very fast. But it only came to fruition, I realized what might be wrong. As with Sex and the City, the writer / director mentioned here for the first time Scott John McKay, and I think he really wants to make a screenplay about three gay men, maybe they go out with respect to their fans and work (characters are school principal, policeman and doctor) It could have been a better and more interesting film. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would have made the parallels with the "Broken Hearts Club" gay. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 4/6/2002)
