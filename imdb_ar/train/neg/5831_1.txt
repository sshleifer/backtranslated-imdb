This film is boring on a large scale and boring. There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr. Barney (think of pretending to be the least purple dinosaur). Music is relentlessly tireless - it is sad that Bj√∂rk, a person with a great inner beauty, has been subjected to false falsification in her art. Pompous tea service makes a beautiful rite look vapid. Do not respect the myths and culture in this film is lifted. Not only from Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (watch out) At the moment of "art imitates life" - the ship's crew finds a giant piece of sh * t. Which is what the audience found in the theater. There are some pieces made up of cut and heartless souls --- then? Prepare for the spoilers - I'm talking to you, Mr. Barney. <br /> <br /> Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you've exceeded! I saw the sacred mountain of Godorowski. Your thin and fake veil was lifted from BS. Your photos and your artistic style have been completely stolen from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has finally been released, let us hope that you stop funding the World Arts Councils! Poor Godorowski lost a financial battle with the Beatles' lawyer when Lennon / McCartney was a filmmaker. And btw while Jodorowsky is the Beatles, you monkeys! A paper without a cheap spirit is loved only by the easiest Keithi college student. Btw i am a movie maker. If you're interested in making a realistic film - I'll fight you legally in a Jodorowsky-you defense ring, defending the obvious theft.
