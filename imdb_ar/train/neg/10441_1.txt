I stopped watching these POSs as soon as the snakes started to "grab" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought she probably should get "one" for comic comfort. But then I realized that I could watch the three free gigglers and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever respect I have for Samuel Jackson, he has been irrevocably destroyed. Hollywood again shows how far removed from reality. As a child we used to pick up snakes for fun. The only thing the snakes will do is to gather at the bottom of the container. No amount of Hollywood feeble snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be careful: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your dumb ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest going down. If you want humor, go to the local comedy club. Their worst performance would be a million times better than this garbage.
