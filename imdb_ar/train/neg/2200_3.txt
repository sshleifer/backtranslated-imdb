I love bad shark movies. I really. I laughed hysterically at them. And the Sci-Fi channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the prime for its original new image, Hammer: Sharks Frenzy. Based on reviews, it looked like it would be very entertaining. Basically a remake of the Benchley creature, really. The show premiered with Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, a Farhan Shark movie at its best. You're in the mood. You're ready to go. Bring him, Crazy Hammer Man - World! Oh my God, this was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Error, Error, Error. <br /> <br /> Patient. Twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is theoretical reproduction at its worst, my friends. When a narcotic girl is taken out of a cartoon hanging and tethered to a table screaming her head because a human hybrid fetus shark "World" deliberately insane deliberately in her womb wants to go out ... the monkeys of Jesus. This is what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is how the plot works: Hmmm, the crazy world thinks. My son died because of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with the hammer shark, because the sharks do not succumb to cancer and multiply the hammer heads across the placenta. Look! An amphibious object is ideal! I have created the next evolution of mankind! I know! Let's make it multiply! But he dared if all these shark genes did not make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping the children I kept sending to his small jungle, he continued to eat it. But check it out! Among the random people who ended up on my island of search, through some unimportant distortions of the scheme, is the woman in which my son was engaged before his death! I bet he'll do it! All this leads to a very influential and sincere reunion: Woman: Will you drink me? Crazy world: no. he is. (Refers to crushing a shark in the tank) How sweet. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie. Start.
