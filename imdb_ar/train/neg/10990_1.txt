I ended up watching this entire film (too long) because I was fascinated by stupidity and stupidity. It seems hard to believe that many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Laurence Olivier, John Gilgold, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) willingly participated in this farce. But perhaps in 1968 people were really * very naive? The plot appears to have been written by some Marxist priests in Latin America who are confused with an agenda. There is a conflict between the superpowers and the Russians. They are in fact the good people. With the Communist Party Secretary General a pleasant and spiritual man, suddenly, 20 years later, he sees himself and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner from Gulaj Siberia. The priest then becomes pope immediately through a series of coincidences. Allows us to see the papal secret process in the Vatican, which depicts the most receptive forms you might imagine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Communists in China have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of half starving a country to death. To solve this minor mess on the bright path toward communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to distribute the wealth of Western capitalism to poor Chinese workers). <br /> <br /> We have a good old comrade. The secretary feels a little worried and calls the Pope just before the coronation to ask him to mediate peace. They meet with Chinese leader Comrade Ping who acts and acts like a 15-year-old boy. She would roll on the ground laughing at what people thought in 1968 that the Chinese had come to him. Comrade Ping demands that Western capitalists (which is perfectly reasonable, should not always have to pay the price of the madness of the Socialists) and that the Pope should sacrifice something, too, for the cause of common altruism. Equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the Pope climbs in Rome, he pledges the full wealth of the Catholic Church all over the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. Thus saving the world from the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there are also some secondary sub-plots, which, unfortunately, provide little to retrieve this extremely bad movie. I will give her three Oscars for the stupid. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn seems unlikely as Kababa. Is more acceptable as is the Greek Zorba.
