With an address like this you know you get a lot of garbage. Acting badly. Bad script. Bad manager. Grammar is bad. <br /> <br /> The film makes a lot of noise that does not hear music and many people do not shout. The film made the ethnic stereotype bad. Why does every movie come with a black hero addicted to drugs? Why does the hero always come to dance to be a success? Why does the famous rapper always come in the dance movie? Why can not the letter "s" be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to stop the stupidity of the public and the film industry, which includes people with brains who know how to speak English correctly. <br /> <br /> Do good yourself and do not go see.
