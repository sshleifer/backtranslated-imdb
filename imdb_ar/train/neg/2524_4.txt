Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stewart Gordon <br /> <br /> Actors: Gary Graham, Ann Mary Johnson, Paul Coslow <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon Which we often associate with very evil horror films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a small turn here and did some science fiction. I stress the word "little" because this flick in the budget is very little, and there lies its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which great superpowers (according to this film about the United States and Russia) have abandoned their differences not by waging a whole world war ... but by waging wrestling battles with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must climb up against the evil Russian robot fighter named Alexander. A lot of cheap motion animation animation entails it. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is wonderful as I think. Major countries settle regional disputes with giant robots? An interesting hypothesis and one that can be handled properly if the appropriate budget is available. Unfortunately, what could have been a fun film ends up embarrassing a great director. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie as a child and I think if you want to enjoy this movie, you'll have to go back to putting a little kid to have some fun with it. "What the hell is this piece of nonsense?" And I'm fine, this film is a science fiction film by one of my favorite directors, Stewart Gordon? "But as the film progressed into an area full of feeling, I felt as though I had stopped pushing and not to make them They are engaged in this torture. The reason, because I loved this movie as a child, and there is still a little nostalgia associated with watching it, but everyone could not see it. <br /> <br /> I realized that the film was not "that's really good. First, the film revolves around giant robots that drive hell out of each other. To do this in a reliable way, you have to use some good damn good effects to make them work, This would help the public to suspend disbelief, but unfortunately, this small-size film, from a small-size company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!) The effects only help us laugh and laugh at them. Incomplete or half-red. <br /> <br /> Well, once you've accepted a mix of graphics, you're awarded You can surrender to the movie and even enjoy the great robots that drive the hell out of each other There are some scenes where the robots fight and they are a bit fantastic and made me go "That's why I liked my favorite movie!" But everyone knows it, Crazy will take you directly from that small protective cocoon that you are trying to hide.Even prosperity, the apparent return to the right to achieve this film just does not live up to its hypothesis. <br /> <br /> Heres something else that bothered me a bit about the film. This film is basically a children's film. You know, giant robots dukes out? Stop motion cartoons? Hi? But this film dialogue had a lot of sexual connotations and bloody violence. So I kept asking myself, Is this a children's movie or not? Soon after I came to the conclusion that it was basically a film for children with adult sensibilities, which is really not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel naively certain childlike charm to watch a robot fight each other, and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie (as I do) Well, I suggest ID to stay away from this robot. Gordons is a great director, but this film he made did not do that for me. Well, at least not now that she's grown up. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
