This is the kind of film that wants to be good but absorb it. First thing, what the hell are these villains trying to do at school? I think children do not seem to realize the seriousness of the situation. Deker tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when they ask why he wants to return for them, but then, he gave a gun on the dude's wheelchair and wanted him to go alone to fix the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors must pay their food, but why not give them the money it takes to produce such a stupid movie or make the money to a charity. Oh yes and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid villain shoots at the cafeteria anywhere like madness. They all want to look professional but they all suck. Something else I do not think there is no emergency exit at the school where the children are trying several doors but they are all closed. What happens if there is a fire and died dumass security guard? It is illegal to have no emergency exit at school. In any case, there is much to be said but it will be long. I spent some time in my life watching the crap.
