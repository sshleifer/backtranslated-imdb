Please, for the love of God, do not see him. Now I say so, I know what you think, can not be so bad can? If everyone said it was as bad as they say, I should watch it! Do not do it! It would be like looking at an appalling accident involving young children and a petrol tanker! You will be scolded for life ... The picture will never leave you! I can only see half an hour before I get sick. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk ripping your eyes and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the story are a trap !! zombies? spelling? The dead Shaun was great! This movie must be the same .... right? No!! Writing = Faulty guidance = Trash representation = No work. Still not convinced? Then forever will torment your soul!
