I just logged in to comment on how stupid this movie is. Besides being part of the Executive Resolution, Air Force One or any other type of terrorist story, this is the kind of film that makes you watch a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It is hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid, vulgar text to work with. This is a bad thing if you once perish in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself swinging again and again, you must conclude that the director is also not the brightest lamp in the film business, nor are the producers to decide to bring this story to the screen the first. Low-rent actors that you can excuse to do the job, because they most likely came to get the money and exposure, not being part of the joke of this movie will win any awards or recognition. They may end up embarrassed by their misjudgment, such as getting involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even giving any examples to prove my case, because doing so would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one can take part in this catastrophe to bear. Studying well-made films can inspire you to make a fine art and craftsmanship. The only thing you can learn from watching this monster is what you should not do or do not do! be cerfull.
