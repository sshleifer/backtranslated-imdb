I, like so many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first appeared in 97. The film was below average at best, and with no challenge to the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans like to make it. First, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter how you look at it. People love it because of its appearance. His "skills" in acting consists of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act in dramatic ways. Second, the film itself had a simple and somewhat boring plot: the girl fell in love with the guy, shipped to the banks, and a lot of crazy love scenes afterwards. Anyone with a IQ higher than 50 will realize that this is not a genius in any way. Nor is it original. In addition, the director felt the need to drag it for 3 hours. I could squeeze it in a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most exaggerated film yet. Why I got so much attention and money is beyond me.
