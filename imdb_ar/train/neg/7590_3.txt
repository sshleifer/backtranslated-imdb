Wonderful bodies, gorgeous colors and camera action, buzz dialogue, ordinary plot. The name of Prima Donna, Camilla, and the flowers with a great name, suffice to remind us of the similarities in the conspiracy of the novel La Dame aux Camelias, Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, the last but not least La Verdi La Traviata. Beautiful young ladies who do not enjoy virtue, social ostracism for one reason or another, loved, separated, reunited in time to die of TB in the last scene ... forgive one of the vile plots and unrealistic dialogue in the opera, but why waste your life, Don Sutherland, a wonderful transfer of the Los Angeles Society in the thirties, an earthquake of machines that killed other women comfortably, all this beauty on this average turkey where there is no beautiful singing?
