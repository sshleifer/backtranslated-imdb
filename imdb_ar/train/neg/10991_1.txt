Brother DVD Collector. He took one look at the cover (two toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to see what turned out to be the most fragile film (I used the term loosely) I felt compelled to sit down. I did not dare make contact with my brother, and certainly he should curse the receipt in his tight grip. The biggest name in the entire film is Michael Clarke Duncan who appears in one scene, which the filmmaker decided to show him in every film (about four total) during the film. In fact, the entire film follows this suit. The fact that the DVD contains deleted footage was shocking. (I went to bed without watching it). No surprise at all, I found this disc without its cover behind the TV after almost a week.
