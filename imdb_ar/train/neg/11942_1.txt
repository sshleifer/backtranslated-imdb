Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and only deteriorates. Katharine Hegel is disappointing in the role of Lolita and wrestling with Leo Grillo bravely with what is essentially a cardboard character. Tom Sesemore is the only member who casts all his enthusiasm, which he describes as evil and fully exercised. The script is awesome, behaves horribly and contains plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus! It's also the sexiest movie I have ever seen! The character of Katharine Hegel is not entirely sympathetic. She looked at her as seductive and wicked and seductive and enticed the innocent married poor man to deceive his wife. It is implied throughout the film that they are below the legal age, and the message that accompanies the beggar scheme is just a belief! In the end, she could not even recover herself by shooting a man who obviously (ha!) Became angry and guilty, but the script allowed him to kill himself and thus recover himself in the eyes of males everywhere. terrible. do not waste your time.
