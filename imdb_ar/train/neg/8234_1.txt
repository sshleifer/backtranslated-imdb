The authors and producers of this small journey have fallen into new depths of corruption. Whether the author's block is too strong, or the thoughts have dried up so much that she has had to include a disgusting scene where a young woman dashes in the back seat of a car and immediately dumps the feces in the car behind your mind. At least this sums up what the film deserves. We have already been treated with one of the other women who urinated on one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as many episodes of graphic vomiting; once was enough ... we received the message! This is really taking toilet humor to another level! If the script and acting were better, I would easily forget that I was watching a full movie on a low-budget video. This was a fairly authentic story, with an intelligent (only) direction from where we could not take the view from inside the truck except ever; making it feel more real. We could not see anywhere else in the store, like the store or the field where many women had disappeared, and that could have added to the much-needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script was bad. Lines like: "I do not feel very good ... I want to go home" after a girl has been pursued by a mentally ill; raped by a screwdriver and shot him, looks a little uncooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was demonic (away from obsession). Have you learned all 5 actresses in this representation by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seemed to have an easy task in this. It seems that the only direction he should have given is: "Girls scream." <br /> <br /> As for the screaming ...... If you see this, make sure you have some paracetamol when you are ready!
