Famous writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allan-Bo) tries to overcome old addiction and start a new life for himself, as a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland. However, power cuts, delirium and refusal threaten to thwart his efforts. He also wishes to revive romance with his old sweetheart, a pretty flawed prospect, as things turn out. Mr. Redfield also directed this drama of the mysterious final days of Edgar Allen Bo. Redfield uses lots of black and white photographs, colors and tricks to create a mood. Kevin G. Shenek (like Dr. John Moran) performs well, relatively. It is not enough.
