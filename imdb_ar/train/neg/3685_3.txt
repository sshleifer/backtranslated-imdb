The main reasons for seeing the "red eye" are Rachel McAdams, who performs great, and Jaime Mays, who is wonderful as a hotel manager. On the other hand, Celian Murphy is too bad to become a cartoonist. The rest of the film is full of holes in the plot, which I will explain in detail. <br /> <br /> Please do not read more if you do not want to know what's going on! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the plot. Risa McAdams (Lisa) is running a hotel where the new high-level internal security director plans to stay that night. Rachel returned to Miami from a funeral, but sent calls from her assistant until the plane left. Meanwhile, someone is stationed outside the home of her father, Joe (played by Brian Cox), and is ready to kill him if she contacts Celian Murphy (Jackson). All Lisa has to do is contact the hotel and move the director's suite to one where the Jackson groups are planning to launch a rocket (from a fishing boat) to kill the manager and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some silly conspiracy holes or coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Finally, Jackson persuaded Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the plane's phones lost contact. Lisa falsely tries to make the call, but by chance, a man across the aisle from Jackson also makes a call and begins to knock his phone to indicate his death. Jackson grabbed the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson beat Lisa and, of course, only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson grabs Lisa by typing a note on the mirror in a lavatory (unusually large), and hits her around a bit. Miraculously, the only girl who hears anything is an 11 year old girl, and her words, of course, are discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa Jackson stabbed by the throat while landing the plane, stealing his cell phone, making a mad dash out, putting the corridor between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite being aware of the presence of a passenger who is rarely stuck in his throat, the flight attendants force Lisa by opening the door to the highway. 5. Well, all of these things are reasonable (if not impossible). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no signal on the cell phone (every major airport in America has a great reception for mobile phones). <br /> <br /> 6. She passes through the airport with Jackson in a hot pursuit, not even security officers delay them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport while the train from the gates had withdrawn to the station, lost some of his voice from a penalty in his throat, but still can be understood to some extent. However, he does not bother contacting his man outside Joe's house. (Note: there is no train at Miami airport, but the train they showed looked a lot like Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and rides away. Of course this time, when you go to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery" and soon it is turned off (when will they stop using this indirect plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone still says "Battery is low", Lisa has reached her assistant in time to save the manager and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor the manager had arrived at he moved. Of course, expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded by three sides of the ocean, so perhaps the missile was launched in the first wing, eliminating the need for the entire outline of Lisa Jackson. What is the story here? Was the original exit room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a poor view? However, everyone comes out before the rocket hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa leads Joe's house to save her father just to see the killer outside. Although she was run over by a jeep in the house, no one in the neighborhood seemed to notice or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and expels him (we do not see how ... maybe the butt of another head). Then he explains to Lisa that he has not killed my father yet because he wanted to see my father die first Lisa (give me a break. <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the film (about 20 minutes), Jackson stalks Lisa around the house and fights him brilliantly. Of course a real killer (that is, perhaps Jason Statham) would have removed Lisa (or anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this chase, Jackson Joe passes at least once without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson reigns, and he is about to kill Lisa when he is shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So, here's my suggestion ... Tell Wes Craven of the commitment to horror. Or perhaps he should meet with Michael Bay (who made the equally stupid "Island" movie) and make "The Red Island".
