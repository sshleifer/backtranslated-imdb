How difficult is it to write a famous film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Jiamati and Kevin Spacey? Apparently, it is very hard to book here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how young Santa is and look older than 20 years from Vince (who plays Big Brother). I have to miss this part of the story but in fact, it was not really important. Many of the scenes seemed to be misplaced; the kind of "funny idea" that was thrown out of the WAY was far from where any sense of comedy was lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go to the "tear jerker" at the end, which would have led to it being suitable if anything leading to this point was worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> Ugh, very disappointed. I can see how some people can enjoy this "OK", since many people will take any of the trash they feed on, but I strongly encourage DVD waiting on this file. Not worth the $ 23,978 you need to connect your family with movies these days.
