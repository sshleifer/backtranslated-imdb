I was browsing Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. After beautiful memories of the book when I was a kid, I decided to check it out. It's a movie you really have to move. <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel it will be this way for young children. He does not have the magic of the book. This movie is not terrible, but you will not find yourself interested in it after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments. Charming personality is not very good. The family behaves as though these strange things are not great. I know this is a children's film, so we should not look at an older audience, but the whole film feels like it was written and produced by people who have never tried to make films before. <br /> A DVD that you started to skip in the final moments of the movie, instead of trying to fix it, you shut it down and sent it back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
