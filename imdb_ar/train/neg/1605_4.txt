I recently watched the documentary "No Television Will Be Broadcasted", also known as "Chavez: Inside the Coup". At first I thought it showed a real inner vision of events during Venezuela's coup in April 2002. What bothered me was the fact that the tone of the narration and accompanying music was suggestive, and that no criticism was ever expressed at any time by Hugo Chávez. This is strange because if the documentary provides an unbiased account of what happened, there must be some. After all, Chavez certainly is not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, much more information is available on the Internet at present, and it has not been difficult to find, for example, the " Blatant rhetoric about Venezuela. " Lists many errors and falsifications intended or unintended in the documentary. (Just use the title as a Google search string, you'll find it). Another interesting document was the video recording to display the results of several errors in this documentary, "X-ray Lying". To me it seems to be a good budget for "Chavez: Inside the Coup" which is available on video.google. I strongly recommend you after watching "Chávez: Inside the Coup" to look at "x-ray lied" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donacha O'Brien were (intentionally or not) part of Chavez's propaganda.
