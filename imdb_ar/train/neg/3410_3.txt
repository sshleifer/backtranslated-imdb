Yes, there are children in this movie who go to the space camp and start fine enough where the children meet each other and learn the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986 because they have nothing with this kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes a friend of the robot and the robot rekindles the child by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp into outer space using a very limited amount of oxygen and radios that have no signal to reach space. The camp is not very enjoyable as these children are trained in real training and teachers excel on failed missions or do not do the right things. Give them some rest, there for fun, so as not to become astronauts yet, just give them the experience of space flight and not military camp. However, you can see Phoenix Joaquin in a fairly early role. So in the end a film tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you may have children fighting aliens on space space above everything else that was happening in the movie as if the movie was a little more fun at least for me. Maybe for a few other people too, who would like to see Kate Cabshaw's face torn by some exotic alien beings.
