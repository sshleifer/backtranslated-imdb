Yes, the subject is a direct quote from the film and I think it is very accurate. I was bored by death because of this futile effort. All the flashes and the meaningless after the first 20 minutes are just a bad movie making + If you have epilepsy, you may have already died at least five times. Of course, all fans of David Lynch raise this kind of turkey to be "the best film ever made" because it makes no sense and when it has no meaning, art and art must always be a good film. right? I say wrong. This kind of artificial art grabbing is just a pathetic way to try to show that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor must continue acting.
