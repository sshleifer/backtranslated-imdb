Well ... the movie was a pleasant hour. The main problem in this film is the fact that it conflicts with everything that is committed to most bats superstitions. Like vampires walking in the sunlight. Although there are parts that make you enjoy the way the community makes movies. A scene where a vampire stabs and screams "This is painful ... it's really stuck." Then there seem to be missing scenes but you get used to it after a while. A random dream sequences do not really help in this plot. Come to think about it, nothing really logical, but I got a group of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think about it, the fighting scenes were awesome, and the zombie was just fun to watch. I wish I write more than this I like this movie more. But as you know, it's all you can not expect from the Schindlers list but it's an enjoyable hour.
