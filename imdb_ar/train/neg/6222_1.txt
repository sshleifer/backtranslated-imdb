I'm not sure whether users should be allowed to review the movies after sitting for only two halves, but I'm afraid I could not stand for another minute. <br /> <br /> If this is not a great excuse for a film we have a late GP player, like spinning in the wheel of his grave, then I doubt anything. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above "is not a movie for Parsons fans that sums up most of my feelings, how the director and the writer (second class) dare to try something they can not deliver clearly. <br /> text: I thought I would get a slice of bittersweet ... What I got was done badly with a jerk without leaving clich√©s unchanged. The characters are written awkwardly female? Make sure twice ... Completely ignore the story you are trying to photograph? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you see is soap and not soap The scene with Knoxville, the scene with his ex-girlfriend, the scene with Knoxville, who did not move much ... The scene with his ex-girlfriend who was like the last one ... so ... <br /> <br /> The trend: I and my friends , After some considerations, that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy, or maybe the Dukes of Hazzard in particular poor.This is how bad the direction was.Credible jump cuts, awful camera work, ins and outs to the viewer.Allah, it was meager. I discovered that the director was an Irishman, and his most recent work was the BBC drama on a bad Sunday night called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the lowest common denominator on television). Then it became logical ... <br /> <br /> Representation: Are we now so important that when a random person from TV decides to give acting, if not very bad, stinks, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville just managed to get every scene. Poor Christina A. He has no such luck. Their performance is a car accident (although what you do with these lines, do not know). "Hippie" in the heart: Dear, dear, dear. Have not we advanced since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could have gone ahead, but I think you got drifting. What I would like to say is that, as other reviews have mentioned, it is clear that no one in this film gives a flying curse to the works of Birds or the Flying Burrito Brothers or individual grams. They did not know anything about the American road movie, and they certainly give the curse of trying to do anything through a recognized story of rocky mythology. This film was shallow, and failed to explore anything, and the jaw was lavish from the beginning to ... Oh wait, I did not finish the end. I suggest you stay away too.
