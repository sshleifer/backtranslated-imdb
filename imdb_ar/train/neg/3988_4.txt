In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee obviously has a lot in mind. He thinks about the color of racism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sex discrimination, "discrimination against sex", drug war policy, etc. <br /> <br /> This level of awareness is private big. I think it is a blessing chosen by more and more people to study the essential aspects of our daily lives in a critical way; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because I make controversial films does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What appears in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these social and political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, I simply try with all difficulty. He seems to be desperately trying to absorb every political / social statement he can think of in the 1990s. As such, the end result seems confused and futile because it does not allow itself time to develop characters that can fully reflect the ideas it hopes to deliver. So it exhausts stereotypes and leaves us with hasty testimonials and highly loaded dialogue boxes. The end result is very unrealistic. Second, by trying to make statements on this wide range of social functions, it seems that it has no real or genuine explanation for the social / political issues presented. What comes across is a pond of non-volatile belief. He feels he bought a book in sociology at the elementary level and put all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are very problematic features because the art of the film is sacrificed and the work becomes a loudspeaker for the sound of the director's voice. He is unable to keep himself away from work, and let him talk about himself. <br /> <br /> It does not work as an art or a sound political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate me putting up these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Thumb is down.
