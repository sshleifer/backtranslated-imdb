For the rest of my life I can not explain how popular the children's television program is. <br /> <br /> I have never understood why unsuspecting children like this offer in the first place, since the characters seem stupid and unworthy of attention at all. <br /> <br /> Fashion looks absolutely awful, like the multicolored spandex worn by people to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this show anyway, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What's up with the dreadful hairstyles, the clothes in this show anyway? Not to mention that this show is still playing on cable TV, just to make money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree about a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for today's children, and hope they are not as naive as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what's up with the phantom sexual tension between the red and green guards anyway?
