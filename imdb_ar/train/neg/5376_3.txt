THE CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slash product that is supposed to be a live movie to a DVD. I say "supposed" because the title of the movie does not contain "V" brackets to indicate that it was made from a DVD movie (although it has one appearance). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple ?? A band stuck in a former meat packing factory and killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most of them agree that the film will never be a masterpiece, but that does not excuse the faults here. Even direct-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which have a very low IMDb rating) have many qualities that restore their value, and are sometimes one of "Too Bad, It's Good." However, the CHOKE is much less than either a serious tilt (like HALLOWEEN) or a "very bad good" movie (like The Nail Gun MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a good character killed using exercises. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable due to the very low budget. But, from there onward, the road became a downward one along the way. <br /> <br /> There are so many disadvantages of suffocation that I can spend all day talking about it. But, a few are clear and I will go to them. <br /> <br /> The party above seems to start with about 50 people but after the music stops, there seem to be only about 8 people (yet they are all supposed to be believers!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are not popular at all. Most of the band members are foul-mouthed or totally bizarre idiots. No one cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about it when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to consider the meat packing plant as a sort of church (seriously!). It pops up some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately, even his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are lots of scenes for people walking and talking without any description. Spend about 65 minutes watching movie characters walking around in conversation. The characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in direct-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, characters spend a lot of time swearing with each other without any provocation at all. There is a lot of explosive ferment (mainly from male characters) and produces almost one full fight. In fact, it can be said that the coordination is as follows: characters roaming around - killing happens - the characters wandering around - killing happens. You can get the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and there seem to be a few lines being spoken without using the word f. Maybe this was supposed to be funny, but very sad. And more, we have all seen that this is done a thousand times (usually to a much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The movie is completely free of any suspense at all. Dead bodies work to provide the only evidence that the characters are at risk. The maniac runs loose but the characters behave just like full nonsense. Do not try to get out of the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves by. Often, they do not demonstrate fear. <br /> <br /> In the same context as the DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer does not appear at the time of the murder (with the exception of the final killing when the identity of the murderer is revealed). A random weapon emerges from anywhere to kill the victim concerned. There is no one chasing the characters at any time. At DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this made the film funny (unintentionally of course), but here it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer has pointed out, soundtracks include music that is very bad, even for those who love the evil rock. The extras seem to dance so uncomfortable. The result (in the end, no music at first!) Consists of a band from Sugarbabe wannabes singing a very bad song that has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like The NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) such as classic movies (like HALLOWEEN and Friday The 13th). However, it seems that the CHOKE tried hard to place it in one of those categories without fitting either. Even as DVDs continue to play DVDs directly, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, the film contains some of the great scenes of killing. But when the remaining characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly, as the intensity of their disappearance disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of traditional movie smugglers in the 1980s should take steps to avoid this film. Classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th should do their best to avoid it!
