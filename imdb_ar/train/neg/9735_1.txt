I tried as hard as I could to sit through this annoying mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dove sucked just as lead and all the cast support were marginally worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is ridiculous, from bad representation to funny FX to the stupid plot. Do not care. Root canal treatment will be more enjoyable. Bamboo fragments under fingernails will be more fun. <br /> <br /> Watching Uwe Boll will be a bit worse. Get an idea?
