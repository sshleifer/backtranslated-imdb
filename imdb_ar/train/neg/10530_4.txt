A disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and Malik Siam", filmed in 1946 with Erin Dunn and Rex Harrison, Deborah Keir as a widow teacher and mother traveling from England to Siam in 1862 to accept the job many of the king's children - One or two things in the process! The rotting image begins well, but loses energy and concentration quickly. Jules Brenner, who returns his victory to his victory as king, is a leading presence, but uses - in the mixed story - as a geek. Kerr keeps her dignity cool and her prices better, although she has to sync up with Marnie Nixon's singing. Perhaps after this part has already been played to death, Brenner seems to have had nothing left to translate on the screen except the bombast. The second half, with Ana's show and the musicians a musical version of "Uncle Tom Tom", is ridiculous, and the songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein are two. Brenner won Best Actor Oscar, but it is Kerr the geek who keeps the ornament on top of the water. Long, heavy, and "old" in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****
