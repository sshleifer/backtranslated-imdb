This is a new production of Steele's novel in which two people succumbed to a tragedy that managed to gather together despite difficulties. I will not call this spoiler because anyone who has read Steel's story knows how it all ends. If you do not want to know a lot about the plot, do not keep reading. <br /> <br /> The character of Gilbert, Ophelia, is a decent French woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making films where she is asked to speak with an accent because, unlike a good actress, she can not actually pull any kind of tone. Brad Johnson, an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a fairly bad divorce. It is nice, gentle and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach through her daughter Pip. At first, Ophelia Matt is accused of being a harassing child just because he talked about art with the child. . They all became friends after this episode and then the couple fell in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leads is not great, although the talent of these two individuals is not in my opinion a question. They have done their best through a predictable plot and text that borders on stereotypes. Two people meet, a tragedy, a greater tragedy, a mystery is revealed, another tragedy, then they meet. I wish there would be more, but there is a short. <br /> <br /> I wanted to entertain meaninglessly, and I got it. As for the genre of romantic films, this film can not be remembered. "Secret Relationship" with Janine Turner is much higher (not Steele's book), as some of Steele's earlier books turned into a film.
