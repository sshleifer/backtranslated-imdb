Unfortunately, many times in this monotonous game, we pulled out pieces of the plot and we thought "Well ... finally, we'll discover something more about why this scene happened .. ... or who is this person ... or maybe we will finally learn and appreciate this personality more ... or understand it M and shared more with this relationship between characters ... etc. "But no such luck! On the contrary, I often tended to turn it off more than once but was stopped when the carrot was hanging, only to find that any small piece inside W The mini-hatever plot (which made a bad one) was just a trick, why I stayed with it until the end of the puzzle, unlike IFC usually had better choices and gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another puzzle). What, or you can not identify with it or its humanity at all ... It is just something that can be much better with a little more effort.
