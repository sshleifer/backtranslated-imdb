I will be frank. I'm not one of the politically correct movies where a woman plays a bad ass who will not take any crap from anyone. If any of the team members wanted it, they could have taken it out in a heartbeat. The MST was fun on 3K, but did not rent the real version. Trust me. Have you lied to you?
