This is one of those last films that could have been wonderful. The basic premise is good - the immortal cat people who are killed to live, etc. - a kind of difference in the concept of vampires. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes everything break down is the complete recklessness of the main characters. Even sociologists know that you need to keep a low image if you want to survive - see how long it took to catch the Unibomber, because a family member discovered it. <br /> <br /> The boy (and to a lesser extent, the mother) acts as if they are not touching. The child is killed without thinking because he did not leave any evidence or impact or live witness. The way these people survived and not discovered for a month is unbelievable, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful - it could have been much more reasonably written, that is to give the main characters the common sense they needed to get them for a long time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not a bad offer. I liked the thing at the end, where every cat in the city meets at home - every time I turn off the food on the balcony and see our cat suddenly rushing from anywhere it was before, I think about this scene.
