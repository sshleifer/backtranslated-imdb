One of them had a great idea: Let Misty Mundae release Lara Croft from Rara, firing guns not only in tight clothes, but also naked. It's really a great idea. The problem is that people who have this have not been able to come up with any kind of text or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "film" barely reaching the average length by restarting many of its parts (often in slow motion), and it seems to have been completely filmed inside the garage. The attraction of Misty Mundae is still clear: they are incredibly attractive and have a natural beauty next to the girl. However, there is nowhere near her patrol with her two star assistants, who share a long sight of lesbians. If "Mummy Raider" is rendered as a video on Youtube, I will classify it as a higher, but "movie" dedicated to DVD consumption, can not get more than 1/2 a * of 4.
