While Santa Claus beats the Mariners is often cited as one of the worst films ever produced, this Mexican-made 1959 film is so bad that it makes SCCM look like "it's a wonderful life." You have to wonder about the opinion of the people who made this film. Perhaps they meant it as a symbolic story in the Third World about capitalist greed and obvious consumption. Nah. . They were not very good. The production company itself made a more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the wolf mania with our heroine has unambiguous hints of sexual exploitation of children. (Perhaps this is the inspiration for the "highway.") Return to Santa Claus: Instead of the Arctic, Jolie Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in Earth-synchronous earth orbit (shades of "MST3K"); His game was made by selected children from all over the world; he had sophisticated spy equipment to check out children who were naughty and cute. The result is like a sweat shop in Orwell's outer space. It's enough to stop your birthday forever. These films and other Mexican low-rent children's films were named in English and widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s. No wonder the 1960s became such a turbulent period in American history. Children born to be forced to bear these "family" films when children are too excited to be revolutionary.
