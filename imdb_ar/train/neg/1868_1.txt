This terrible film is stolen every line of 8mm (italian version dubbed, at least). If you like trash ... real trash, try it; but beware: this is not a kind of "very bad it's good". At a low price, it may sound really like a porno, but believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", or SMS, hardcore, or soft, or even exciting excitement, look for something else in the store! I tell you this, because the unprovoked and unconvincing shooting, the dialogues, the plot, the dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are stolen from Joel Schumacher 8mm!) Will make you cry in a few minutes and the happy ending is disgusting! I will give her one star: half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after the "victim's eyes" monologue (stolen from 8mm too) and half for the erotic objects of my mother and daughter (which did not succeed to keep me awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
