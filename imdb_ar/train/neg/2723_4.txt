Claire Dennis's films appear to fall into one of two categories: violence, bloody, calm, and intimate. L'Intrus is definitely in the first category, but it's not too bad like "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Now, ever since I saw "Chocolat" I've made it a point to see every new movie made by Dennis. I have always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She still has to make a personal film and move like her first film. <br /> <br /> You can get a lot of the usual Dennis elements: Beatrice D, older and older and still wonderful in the film to show her full lips, gap between her teeth, wide division, and a couple of nice coats. The black man from Trouble Every Day, J'ai pas sommeil and Gr√©goire Colin, that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michael Sobor's personality was interesting enough, but the camera stayed on for so long that I was disturbed by the curly hair curl hanging over his forehead, and I felt relieved when, somewhere in Korea, it seemed, I'd finally cut it. <br /> <br /> Surely there have been some actions - heinous murders, the search for a man about a son - and maybe there was a scheme, but one offer was not enough to know it, and two viewers are, I'm afraid, out of the question. For one reason, the result was garbled and exciting (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the classes changed very abruptly, making you more puzzled about what was going on. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you like "Friday evening" with clips in heavy curtains and bedspreads, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, clear routing. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French, and I probably missed something crucial. But the dialogue in one of Dennis's films rarely reaches more than five pages, separated by spaces and with large margins. In "Chocolat" Semitic silence. In L'Intrus, it's just boring.
