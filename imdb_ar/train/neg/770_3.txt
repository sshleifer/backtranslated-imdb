Strange Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of the fraudster Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious mate and nutritionist Jamie (Valeria Golino) Jack's brother. Jimmy does not buy his story, dominating Jack and tying him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000.00 each to protect him in negotiating "Spanish judges" artifacts with a rich and dangerous collector. Max calls his stupid dating book (Mark Bon Jr.), who comes with his backward girlfriend that she believes to be from Mars, to form a backup team. However, Jack intersects with the collector group, then conspires with Jack, Jamie and Bez. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish judges" is a film with a reasonable scenario with a terrible conclusion that misses good actors. Valeria Giulino is amazingly beautiful, but with the good actor Vincent de Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. Moreover, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, which are actually silly and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
