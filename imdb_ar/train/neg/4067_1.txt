Am I wrong, or is the 2007 release just a rip-off? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... bad representation, bad editing, etc ... The only "exploitation" here is how we broke up our money buying this piece of crap. No more than light weight porn flick ... no real gore, no scary pictures, just a little garbage to do cheaply. If anyone wants to see an excellent movie without reps for names, some nice bull and decent story ... Get Baby Blood ... also on a cheap but well made budget ... and an actual story too! It's a waste of money but I'll just keep it laughing ... it's pathetic! New comment .... September 3 ..... I'll keep this movie forever just because it's so bad, it's almost good ... in a really bad way .... the worst representation at all ... classic real movie crap!
