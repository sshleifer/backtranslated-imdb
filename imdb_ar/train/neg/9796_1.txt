Well, I can not seriously think of anything worse than PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers have to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five teenagers (who do not even act as a normal teenager) dancing in identical suits with different colors so you can tell them out? Fans, have you ever encountered a real person who collides with a mental wall and wakes up almost immediately and continues to fight without injury? Power Rangers for five-year-olds, and believe me, I never liked this show even when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I think you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers actually act like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually behaves like a teacher, or not, as a teacher. I have passed through the humor of a teenager, although the fighting is limp, but I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say Power Rangers is foolish, but I will not. It would be an insult to crap. Face it, boys five years old, Power Rangers crap.
