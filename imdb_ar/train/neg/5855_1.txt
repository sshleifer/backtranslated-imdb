The film, which was shown at the beginning of 2000 along with MELA of disasters, is very sad that the millennium begins with such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film seems to fit the 1970s but it seems an unintended comedy for the year 2000 <br /> < Some of the classic gems of the film: Parish Rawal I do not understand that I laugh at his role or cry Cause: Going looking for his mother in the village The worst part is when he realizes the secret of Anil keeps a secret in his stomach that becomes great and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me The same humor Urrf !!! As a child I laughed at the time but here? <br /> <br /> The entire film is a joke that can not be made clear that we have Anil in a double role (one older and younger) and Rihanna playing the older wife and young Ravina. We also reject Harish while Shakti plays the role of an Iranian Aruna son who fights all Who has the worst wig? <br /> <br /> Anil tries to look very old in the younger role and in the older role, but the good efforts made by Rekha are enough, Ravina is also fine Harish Bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani As usual Rajnikant is fine in a blow
