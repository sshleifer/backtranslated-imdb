I rented this movie only to see Amber Benson, but after reading the box, I thought it sounded like a good story ..... but the first problem was that there was really no story ... or actually there was a story but that made no sense at all . Yes, they all went to school together, but during the first three minutes of the film I realized they had nothing else in common and the others did not like it ... so why do they get together? Disadvantage No. 3 ... Manager Despite the long stop and the narrow picture capture of the suspense equation (especially with the dubious thrill music) ... it was unfortunately wrong. It was painful to see such a great actress like Amber Benson wasting her time trying to bring this back to life .... My only hope is that the money she gave here was geared towards producing her own film.
