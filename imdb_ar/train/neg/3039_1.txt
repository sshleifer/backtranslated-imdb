I can always determine when there will be success. I see her or I hear her, and I get a good feeling. I did not get a good feeling by watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and I was never surprised to label it as one of the worst 100 films. I have proved my right in reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing I threw was the title. I have no problem with ebonics (I'm black by the way), but for a film they could have used a better title, and at that time they used a title that did not contain grammatical rules. I've heard the dialog box, I've seen the representation and all I can do is make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think the theme of the dance movie is exaggerated. At least "I got served" was the best of this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not excite me.
