A romantic and totally wrong vision of unemployment from a middle-class "artist" with a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director did not suffer from unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience with it. If you have to believe this very silly story, unemployed men of all ages act like teenagers, and have no anger, fear, frustration, etc. All characters live in the arms of the day by carrying jokes and nascent jokes. They never look for work, never get rejected or depressed, and so on. Living in the temple is almost a summer holiday from school ... ridiculous. Especially when compared with contemporary masterpieces such as Ken Loach, etc.
