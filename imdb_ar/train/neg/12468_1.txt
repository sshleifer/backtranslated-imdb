Simply put, the film is boring. Clich√© is emphasized on cliches and story lines do not come together. It seems as if the director is not sure of producing a film or documentary film. The plot is very thin (asking the CIA agent to kill the oil prince, and arresting him and warning the prince (why?)) And thus some elements have been added to make the film more interesting. Therefore, a child dies, leading to "normal" response of the father: freely advise the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a "friend" drunk and keeps him, why, no one knows. Some children become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I was neither fun nor intellectual. I did not laugh or cry, and I did not understand and did not have to learn more or take up a case. That did not mean anything to me, which in my opinion is the worst anyone can say about a movie.
