I simply gave this three because he achieved what my companions and I hope to do: entertainment. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this thinking, it would be a zombie movie there with the likes of Romero or Folsi, but what I hired was to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for entertainment, or a film that makes you shake your head in embarrassment, look for it. This is ideal for novice enthusiasts "Mystery Science Theater", but the only downside is that it is very bad, and ridicules itself. <br /> <br /> Personally I think it's a shame to associate this with any other Hollywood title we might know, because when you suck a movie like this, it has its own kind.
