A slow-moving comedy, supposed to counterfeit the classic "foreign invasion" films, is in fact no better than them, except, of course, in the purely artistic section (good make-up effects). And any worst parody of its goal is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" worse than any James Bond movie). Two hours after hearing the screams of foreigners, you will beg for some calm and tranquility. (* 1/2)
