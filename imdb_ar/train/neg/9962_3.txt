The book "Respect for Representation" by Ota Hagen is a standard book in many university theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing personality as an actor: presentation approach, and representative approach. In the presentation approach, the actor focuses on perceiving the person as honestly as possible, by introducing the emotional elements of the actor's life. In representative approach, the actor tries to present the emotion effect, through a high degree of motion control and sound. <br /> <br /> The representative approach in representation was still partially in vogue when Hamlet was made. The British theater has a long history of this mode of representation, and it can be said that Olivier is the ultimate king of the acting school. <br /> <br /> It was not a nice time with this acting school, or for this movie. Almost every representative today uses a casual approach. For the modern era, Olivier has the elegance and elegance of the design. Instead of creating an internally contested Hamlet, Olivier made a loud, self-effacing bouquet away from a dark religion - a representative style that would have performed well for the great theaters of London, but so energetic that it is hard to do with modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> So the film screams mercilessly today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: "In the middle, you have to take care and get a temporary expression that might give him ... sleek!" Instead of crying in an interview with his father's ghost (as any suitable representative can), the bright lights in Olivier's pupils give us this impression. <br /> <br /> Elaine Hurley is the only other actor in this Hamlet, a good article in the Queen, despite the obvious age differences painful (he was 41 years old, was 26 years old). The other actors in this film have no chance of accomplishing anything else, given Olivier's inclination to keep it! Camera! on him! Absolutely! Times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, she feels insecure about a Shakespeare playwright who lacked the confidence to portray Hamlet, who is broken and defective, and instead was elected to portray a kind of Elizabethan trumpet. The final analysis: "I would like to have such a colleague who was flogged in order to play a vandalized role; he beats Herod: your attitude, and you avoid it."
