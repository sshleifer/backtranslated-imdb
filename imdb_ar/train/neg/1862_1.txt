It's not the plot alone that makes this film an immediate start for bored viewers. It is a terrible trend with a terrible scenario and left and right errors which makes this very painful to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see "fun" in this. Just the thrill of pointing out many mistakes and monotonous. Well, I wonder how the directors in their producing companies think stupid when this movie was first introduced. Perhaps stupid like that Sheriff who pigeon in a pickup truck filled with freezing with a serious bloody wound. Girl's face! Have you forgotten to mention that this sheriff is not only a poor representative but also can ignore any fault with a load of frozen ice covered flesh? I think he forgot something when he made an unprecedented victory over the snowman.
