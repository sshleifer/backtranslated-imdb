They're selling it as a horror film, it's supposed to be an exciting film, but I found it very funny (comedy ?, I do not think so). I laughed at the whole film and I thought it was because of the plotting and conspiracy. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but okay. I think Celian is a very good "bad guy". I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel Mac Adams. She is beautiful and a good actress too, but let's try to be a small target here, a mm mm story ... mm mm direction ... she lacks a lot of good thrill in fact it's a really boring film, but there's one good thing, Short, it only takes an hour and 30 minutes (for me it was like 10 minutes under water !!!) <br /> <br /> I just do not know why this movie was rated highly, and in rotten tomatoes, higher, What is wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
