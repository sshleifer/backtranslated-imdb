I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison environment, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, and the grotesque 1980s touches, and it is a deliberate effort by actor John Saxon, who plays a bad role (guessing him) as a bad guy. It reminds me of some of the Italian horror clicks (beloved). But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmare / scary moment there. It goes on and on, and then (logically) must end. It was possible to seal more interesting and daring images and fate as a classic cult.
