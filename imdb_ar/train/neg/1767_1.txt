One may wonder why? Screaming characters, screaming, and chewing the scene for no real reason except for someone who wanted to make a film in Barcelona. Billy Baldwin, is that true ?, can be forgotten in the role of cop / husband scattered / loving the girl's gentle father. It seems that the story has been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years. Elaine Bombo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to absorb energy from every scene. Her true representation range is displayed when she takes off her shirt while the movies are interested from the sight of a limping stalker to another. Unfortunately, the guidance is rarely bad enough to be a camp or a parody. Everything is just clich√©, familiar in every respect. The director took out his daughter as an early nerd because it is unlikely that any respectable client will ruin his career by being in a lame, interested and uninteresting film. The only theft here is the theft of investor money and viewer time.
