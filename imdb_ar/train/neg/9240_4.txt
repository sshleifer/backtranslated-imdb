It seemed to me that the idea of ​​creating a mini-series around the Berlin Air Bridge was one of the most interesting (postwar) German films. It is a subject that has not been explored so far. However, the makers of this series are stuffed with clichés. Already starts with a DVD cover for the movie, a copy directly from the cover of Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> Louis-Louis Kellberg (Bettina Zimmerman) is known for her husband, a doctor who died in Russia and after the war was struggling to survive. She finds work at the American base, works in the highest and highest ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in the town, falls in love, and carries, and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on!!! We have seen this once very often. Both Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play well, but Bettina Zimmerman has never been convinced. For some reason it seems rather late in giving the correct emotional reaction to the viewer. It was not useful to me. <br /> <br /> Traffic scenes with airplanes and an air elevator, we sometimes feel thrilled, and often do not. Bad things always seem to happen to the pilot himself. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a WWII fan, I suggest you spend your money on something else: Chocolate Ice Cream brings a lot of satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
