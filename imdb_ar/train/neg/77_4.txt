I have seen this opening film at the weekend in Australia, and I expect with excellent representatives from Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the final story of Ned Kelly will unfold in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the outstanding performance of Heath Ledger in the leading role, but the scheme was paper .... This does not inspire me to read "our sunshine". There were a few other points where Edgerton's support in particular was assured of the direction from Jordan (which underscores his talent for the buffalo show), and the production design that gave a real sense of cruelty to the Australian bush. Early 19th century saw it. But I can only feel that another opportunity has been lost to tell the true story of an Australian hero (or was he?) ... I think he is a concession to Hollywood and selling the image in the United States. Well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose the beards just to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> I think I would have to convince myself only of Peter Carrey's "Super Secret History of Kelly".
