The photography on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen was dead. I think I missed seeing half of the film. However, it was poorly positioned and not interesting. I did not find the story about "Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or thriller film, but I was not involved enough to care after the first few tires. I hired the film especially for Willem Dafoe and was saddened that he wasted his talent. I do not think that Gida Colgrand has studied filmmaking long enough to develop a great cinematic image. She is attractive and may evolve into a representative but has taken on many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships do not seem reasonable. I do not understand why other characters were introduced into the plot.
