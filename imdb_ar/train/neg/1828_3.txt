I watched "Envy" two nights ago, on a DVD, in a home for friends. The premise of this film is very promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in comedy with a lot of potential, but completely failed to deliver. I saw her with about five friends and no one laughed at the entire film. Jokes (which are few and far between) are not funny in any way ... The story line is nonsense, and they never answer the question ... Where to go SH * T GO? Of course the answer to that is not interested. This film lacks any sort of comedic value, and as a few other users have said, the only thing that makes it worth watching is Christopher Wynn as a Guy. None of the characters are developed, the plots are very thin and are semi-transparent - is this song all over the film supposed to be funny?
