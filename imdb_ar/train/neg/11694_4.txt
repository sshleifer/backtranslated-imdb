Even "thinner" ... yes .. this is Steven Bakhman (read Stephen King) yarn about a man who gets only candy from an older Gypsy who has just died, the same story exists, no doubt, but I do not know why I did not enjoy it More than I could. I think what really distracts me is the actors. I mean, who is the lead? Robert John Burke? who is he? Apart from shouting out loud, can someone stop hiring Joseph Mantegna in every role of the Italian mafia? And while we are in it, should every mafia get a spaghetti cooked or an Italian? The only good acting job performed here is less than 10 pounds of make-up, Michael Constantine as the Gypsy Gypsy. It's very good. But the rest, I make you all "better reps ..."
