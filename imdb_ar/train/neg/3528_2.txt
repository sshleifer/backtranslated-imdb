There are a lot of comments on this film, yet I found it misleading. This is an overuse scenario, where a normal person becomes a partner in crime for someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. A boy meets a girl. A girl carrying a boy at gunpoint for something ridiculous. He was born fascinated. <br /> <br /> You know the exercises: it turns out that the opponent is a wild and free spirit instead of a social scientist ... toss a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheidi "Is she crazy or does she just need a hug?" The role of the breakfast club simply reeks as a leading figure. All that remains is Turkey's hideous film.
