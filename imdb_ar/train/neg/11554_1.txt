This film is an embarrassment to the film industry. I can not believe it was included as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the program terrible, but the people who had been shot had to be shot. Jill Ojrady is just a wonderful actress, but then ... 99% of the rest of the actors ... Ouch. Everyone is pretty much ... Wow so hard ... Wow. Here's the number one rule about comedy "Do not try to be funny". There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them have been used in this film. Canadian nepotism and filmmakers help perpetuate the bad film industry in Canada. I realize this is a "American" film technically, but look at the director, actors, location, and so on. I've only seen this on Bravo - they should be ashamed because they bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are a lot of wonderful movies that can not be broadcast and they present this nonsense.
