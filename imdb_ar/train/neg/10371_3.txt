Or "Marlow in the Sea". After another ridiculously exaggerated film with a bogey. Very chatting, too. Bogey plays essentially the same character as Marlow; she always controls any position, and she is not at all nervous - no matter how dangerous the situation is, the call to "thin" women, "ladies" and other such nonsense is the only "real male" Alpha mentioned in the film (male alpha only the other male to be the head of Gestapo - but male male only fat) and of course - every young attractive who comes his way can not resist his magic and wants his penis within hours of its initial submission. The personal cliches are all here. Bougui is supposed to be the same kind of cynical reform as in Casablanca, and naturally he usually rejects money or other valuables when he is introduced to them - but how does that fit with the tough guy in it? No, so can not be sarcastic; hawks wanted it in both directions: the character that is both "cool single naive" and yet humane good faith. I do not think so ... Bacall does her first "cute babe" junk, and there are a lot of excessive, not interesting exchanges, called "sexual innuendos" between her and Bogey; these dialogues seem silly today. "Just save your lips and whistle ...". A load of crap ... She was nineteen years old, but she seemed older, much less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bone face, with its sharp features, is nowhere near the radiance of this kind of female beauty of Deafiland, the attraction of Mirna Loy, not to mention the possibility of Irene Dunn. Bacal was more suited to play vampires, not deaths. (In real life, very much like her face: the Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene where tears are cracked; not very appropriate for her character. There are two or three bad music numbers - but the Quick Launch button was ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading Bogart, Bacall, Huston and other Hollywood characters, contact me by e-mail.
