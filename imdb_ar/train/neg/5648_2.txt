Boston has turned legal to its tail and headed to the barn door and swine point it created! When this show was first broadcast for almost four seasons, this was a comic slap on the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of portraying. It was funny, varied, and somewhat realistic. The characters that were filmed were acceptable and to some extent true in their images. Sexual commentary and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen was beautiful, as was the case in another series she participated in, but she is now drifting into the depths of media programming for sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is an excellent actor and has a days of "Benson" to this production he established in the field of entertainment, and always shows humor and mutual respect for production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous are Candace Bergan and you should be admired for her continued production and she is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his ability to act, but must return to his own XXX assets such as "Crash" because he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be in the trash as it already is and really started to smell it !!!
