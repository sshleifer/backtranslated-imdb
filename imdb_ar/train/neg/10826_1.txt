I can not say that this is the worst movie of all time, but just because there are still some movies I have not seen, yet! This should be the most exciting attempt to make a film at all! The director suffers from the same problems he faced with "Will Will Blood" (although it was not too bad in this film, it seems you're seeing a man trying harder to influence him than he does.) It looks like he's sitting on a chair. "I do not know if this film could be taken out by a big filmmaker, certainly some of the great nuggets that could have been polished, but it did not ripen. Something, the scene in which all the characters sing was the worst moments in the history of cinema, one by one as we see personal I sang, and pressed my seat, I kept saying "Please, please, just do not have the man on the verge of singing death, too!" Sure, a tremendous failure!
