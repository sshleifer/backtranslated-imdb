I am a nice person, so I was given this 2 movie instead of 1. It was by far the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was very little plot, and the most interesting areas that were touched, what Jesus might have wanted us to know already, were polished and instead, we received heavy visual doses of the sadistic punishment that our heroine (arquette) suffered. Overall steel in the first 15 minutes was more humane for both her personality and the audience. The acting was barely there and the direction was uninspiring. If I saw another drop of water or a pigeon flying toward the camera, I began screaming louder than Patricia.
