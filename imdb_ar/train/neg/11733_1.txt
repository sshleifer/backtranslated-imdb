I was shocked by the presence of people who loved this movie .. I saw it in Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but frankly, the plot for this film needed a major review ... It was not logical, two characters wondering what they were getting involved with ... The next day the scene they were hopelessly addicted and how to make it? Just finished with the cake .. will not spoil the wonderful result ... but blend perfectly with the rest of the terrible plot / script ... Watch this movie for comedy if you ..
