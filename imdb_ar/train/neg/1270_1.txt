Hercules Puero, in general, is a well-known "hero" of books and films. This movie or story does not work and I felt it was not Agatha's fault. The cast is not good, the actors exaggerate the exaggeration and make silly gestures, and the fashion is so clean and tidy that everything (even Arabic clothes) seems to be fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice that this film can be considered a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor who plays Hercules Puero does a great job but nothing wonderful. The viewer, as mentioned before, is perfect and fake appearance. The story is not very charming despite the secret of murder but who cares about the death of a blond and evil lady over 45 years in the Iraqi desert ?! "Victim" is not likable.
