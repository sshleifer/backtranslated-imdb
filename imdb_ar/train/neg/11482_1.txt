I saw when Harry met Sally, then avoid this. It will not only make you knock your head on the table, why can not Bollywood make a good new copy; but also annoy you with so-called funny moments in it. The magic of the movie is missing. Rani looks terrible. Saif tries to act as if he is one of the actor's inferno. The plots captured from the original, do not look as effective as well. The part where both meet with his friends and make a note, does not seem attractive. What could be more catastrophic? Want to waste some money, that is what you can get. Otherwise, put some dollars, and watch the original text. It's good to miss ..
