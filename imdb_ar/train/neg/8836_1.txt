This is not an art, it is an internal propaganda, urban and politically correct! The political fanaticism of Jundabeen is unforgivable ... He does not see people as individuals, but as individuals in categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most aggressive Australian movie I can ever remember (and it's up to some very intense competition!). Film Letter, every tired tired subject of the modern left exists: Indigenous people are the victims; white men are violent or addicted to alcohol. White women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are probably depressive. <br /> <br /> Four men go fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (of course, the indigenous people) and leave her in the river for several days while catching trout. It is a strange decision taken almost without discussion, as if men were animals. The only man who grumbles briefly is the depositary ... we know that because he lives with a bisexual woman - he loves to have a lot of his baby - and eventually moves to a more modern coastal location (away from all those monsters living in the jungle). <br /> <br /> This film is made by these modern urban dwellers living in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil who reside at home. It is ignorance of rural life is almost as shocking as contempt. The film is filmed through far-reaching scenes of the jungle supported by rare, mysterious music. It has become very clear in the end that indigenous people are the only ones at home in this scene. And concludes with an unequivocally implausible scene of reconciliation between blacks and whites. <br /> <br /> In Jindapine, rural life has shrunk to a little more than the background of a story that claims to outweigh the values ​​of urban left-wing urbanization. More residents than Australians. <br /> <br /> This film did not make people with real jobs but funded by the Government Film Finance Company. It is the product of a technical group, a vacuum that is not filled by so many beautiful people who finance lavish government funding these very offensive projects (which are as separate from real life as possible), rather than making popular films that people really want to see. It does not matter whether the film is stinking, still getting paid. <br /> <br /> Avoid yourself from wasting time, and avoid it like a plague. Social commentary is more than actual entertainment, this movie deserves to be animated!
