One of the worst movies I have ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I recover my money from a Hollywood video?" These are by no means worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to break the films "Mexican" or "Vin Diesel", but failed miserably to do so. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors who could not find anything better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were laying out the lines for the actors, and that was to be expected. The Mexican accent of the leading lady has been exaggerated, worse than animation. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
