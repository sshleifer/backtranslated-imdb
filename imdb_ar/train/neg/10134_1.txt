Stephen Segal's films were never an Oscar material, but with each passing version, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> This film begins with Sigal's filming by the FBI because he killed a few people "in self-defense". The active army is kept from jail to rescue the stolen Stealth plane that the evil English villain will use to make Hollywood Manic including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film is terrible. The dialog box, which is almost always presented with the addition of cheese and loss of representation, is presented. The story is not interesting, there are segments of them that make no sense at all and do not add anything to the story, and the characters of the film as a whole like the "lesbian" interaction between the two main female cast members out there just to get viewers and viewers, so as not to be confusing because it is not It makes sense to do this when you do not need to. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible scenario that includes a bad dialogue, presented by substandard actors, is boring and sometimes scenes of bad movement, and irrelevant parts that are only almost impossible to achieve and make the film worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of life and give this Miss, even if you are the most enthusiastic Siegal fan.
