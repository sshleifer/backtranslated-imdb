I'm actually watching this movie as I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of evolution as a true artistic director," so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (I'm still thinking I'm watching offline) that this movie. . . To put it mildly, it is very exaggerated. Again, very. <br /> <br /> It seems like a really bad student film made by someone with very limited resources. . . He did not care so much about detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want to continue in all the different ways I find this film lacking. . . Okay . . . I just do not understand her (remember, I fully admit that it is likely that I am the idiot here - not the movie maker - for not getting "the piece of fairy genius"). . . I rented this for a whim because the reviews were very outstanding too. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
