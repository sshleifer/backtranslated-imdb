This film is meaningless at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive the huge NYPD cars. The characters do not behave in any reasonable way at all. I'll put my comments in the chat panel, but save your time and money, that's stupid. I can not stand up when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on fast-moving equipment and uses great editing and quiet music, and does not care to get a piece of land hanging together even at the basic level. But it is good to see Denzel W. reign over Man, who comes in three flavors, Judy Foster, mayor of Bloomberg and Captain von Trapp. There is even a sweet little kid with a nice video game.
