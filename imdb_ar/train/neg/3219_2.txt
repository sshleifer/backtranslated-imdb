Someone described Howard Koch as a Schluckmister player but he wrote a script for "Casablanca", right? Or did not. Maybe there's more than a shack wandering around in Hollywood, and I'm not very fond of Casablanca anyways. Wait a moment - yes, there is another Howard shack walking around the Holloway. This is the person who wrote "Casablanca". Did not matter. I will pay great attention to this comment like "Howard W. Koch" in this production, which means little. <br /> <br /> Do you know how this looks? Someone read Cliff's remarks on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, because there were no original ideas on board the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update him and make Hollywood a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast estate between three sisters before doing so and asks them how much he loves. Two sisters receive their own feet and brown his nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to work on Lear. But in the play, Lear is still alive to regret his decision to give two connivers to his hiding and deprive the honest girl. He ends up crazy and naked during a storm on swamps, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinations. Children can do this for you. (Take my child, for example, after all the efforts he has made in raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) Finally, everyone dies in the play. <br /> <br /> In the film, the true sister is obviously suicidal and suicidal, but when she tries to evade herself, someone jumps and saves her, so the ending is pretty happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless Hollywood knows it is a tragedy enough.
