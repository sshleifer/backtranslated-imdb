This film, originally released at Christmas, 1940, was long believed to be lost. A very bad copy appeared and was converted to a CD, now for sale. Do not buy it! The film is indescribably terrible. The casting process is bad, the script is bad, and the guidance is horrible. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young Singing and dancing. This was the highlight. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been intentionally lost.
