Of all the movies I have seen, the rate of this show is almost below it (haunted mansion, nothing but the problem, and some other movies prevent it from reaching the bottom). It's a hasty movie, the story is shaken, and the events are portrayed badly. Of course we have to put some of this on the door of the book writer. The book that was filmed after the film is outrageous and illogical. Oprah offers a palatable look to the mother of Peggy, but she is almost out of reach. Other famous artists seem to be at their worst. The plot, centered around an African American, has decided to take over as a driver. In the leadership of his family daughter to a communist dinner becomes aware. One thing leads to another and the girl is drunk. Now the family he works in is not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes to the house, he puts her in bed, but she begins to eat. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Pager tries to silence her, but instead strangles her. Fearing now that he is having trouble killing a white girl, he is doing what any logical thinker will do - he drives her to the coal oven. Investigators carry out the case of a missing person and check the furnace (the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of the ashes, and then he was arrested and the last hour or so was disgusting slats from the courtroom.) Desperate for a bad film, this film could do the job, but if you wanted Seriously to get to know cultural issues in the 1940s and '50s or to watch a good drama. There are far better options to avoid.
