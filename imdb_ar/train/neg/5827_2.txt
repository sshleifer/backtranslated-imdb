Do not leave an impression from other reviewers that this film is stinking because it is in contrast to the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally speaking, is no worse than the US meat trade or the execution of Scottish pilgrims), it's teasing because it's guff up-its- behind - which gets modern art a bad reputation. However, there are some amazing images, but there are amazing images in the middle bus trip if you use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and is often accompanied by a soundtrack that looks like it's never being removed, and then, when you think it's over, starts again. I've seen him in a pornographic cinema in Rome hired over the weekend to show the work of Barney, a wonderful and smart way to restore what was once a domestic backyard of dirty business veterans of the old brigade, but if the trendy little things and the younger Bjork fans We were all honest, maybe everyone would have enjoyed it more if they showed someone than porn!
