If you are looking for a film that depicts the futile and boring presence of middle class life being captured in a network of unconnected ideals, this is the right movie for you. If you also see what the movie is watching and keep your interest, you're likely to look elsewhere. There are many movies that do this much better. For example, try some darker films by Bergman. The director felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he had to expose the viewer to a boring accident and a painful emptiness after another until the film finally ended to its arduous and pathetic end. If you appreciate your time, there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your home, for example.
