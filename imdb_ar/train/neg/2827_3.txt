The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the 20th century (late) from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he deliberately criticizes two of the favorite enemies of filmmaker Richard Fleischer: Arabs and Germans. To make us think that the men who look to the Arab world and who will be free to roam and roam easily with blacks in West Africa are as reasonable as whites looking for slaves in the "roots." It is clear that both characters are managed / managed by the local population and include (d) more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in the slave and sex trade today, Israel is one of the worst offenders according to Amnesty International. Why should we only refer to the Arabs and then choose Germany as the only European buyer? There is clearly a bias and hatred towards these people by a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The representation is higher than average, especially Peter Ostinov (Solomon) and Big Biddy (owner). Michael Kane (Dr. Linderbie) is as good as always.
