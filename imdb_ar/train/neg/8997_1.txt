This is the worst film I've ever seen, except "They Saved Hitler's Brain," the worst film I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a fan of SNL and SCTV, so I was expecting what I thought would be the most extreme movie that could be produced because it did not have the limitations that TV software improvement programs should deal with. <br /> <br /> The book must have thought we would throw some horrors, some belly bulging jokes, some cheap sex and hey we have a perilous side of dividing a funny comedy. The act of acting is more than just an unimaginable cheap take-off on a stupid deal. The COM sit-off was involving one girl and her boyfriend just a bad humor in high school. The stun grenade was announced for Sesam Street. It was a comic strip of a Los Angeles subway with a pleasant sense of humor by the taste of blood. The French chef who was walking blindly kept saying "There is no difference" in French, well, I got my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny play that included Chevy Chase lasted for a full minute. This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes I have read the comments about the whole country that was stoned in the seventies and you will love this movie if you are high. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 1970s. If an incompetent book has been stoned, it must have been taken on the nasal sinus medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when I saw this movie. Of course the word has not yet come out about the seriousness of the film.
