I just finished watching a guinea pig - the experience of demons. I have to say that this film, although it has a very good FX, but I was expecting it better. I can not honestly say that I enjoyed this film at all. Of course, he is on his way to being an astonishing, realistic and twisted tort for 43 minutes, but I found it very boring (not as bitter as I had hoped). I also found that the torturers were very troublesome when they talked and rushed as they tried to be tough all the time, which destroyed him more (and I'm sure there are some people who will agree with me). I have now seen a guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much about the experience of Devils, unlike Great Fx, getting off the acting of the girl, annoying fu ** ing tortlers, in general, I give her 4 stars on account of FX cos and they are fantastic.
