Okay. For starters, the taxi driver is amazing. This, this is not a taxi driver or spectacular. What is bad. But I thought it was a bad funny, which meant he had some ransom qualities. Like dialogue ... Wow. There was no plot or more, the characters were stupid, the film was preaching. There were some places where she thought the film would plunge into a cab driver's violence, which would hit the letter at the end of the film heavily on his head. I can not even believe that there were 20 other people watching this movie. Yes, it is worth watching if you feel real bored and want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can produce a movie, or at least try to do so.
