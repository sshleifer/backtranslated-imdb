terrible. Just awesome. The script is intrigued, the representation is painful, and the story goes on only. It is, no doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and others. This will not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and star of the film, as well as self-glorification. I found myself not interested in the sophisticated romance between the two main characters, and the ending was not soon. It has two replacement features. The first is that many of the footage is really beautiful, especially in Paris, and looks good in black and white. Second, whether you are a tango lover or not, the music is generally excellent, (except where Sally starts to sing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need unintended laughter. I'm sure he appeals to someone. Statistically, it is for.
