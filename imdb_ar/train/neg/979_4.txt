Anyone with a keen interest in science fiction should start from the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to start, which is good but the truth is TERMINATOR. This film, SOYLENT GREEN, is a much better choice than the series. SOYLENT may be the secret of the best science fiction. This film is still one of the biggest films, but forgotten so far, but the effect of its preparation has become more true as each day passes. Charlton Heston exaggerates his role, but he works successfully. Edward J. Robinson, in his last role, has made the most of him in the movie "SOYLENT GREEN" more than anyone else, and his latest touches touch. It is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A senior executive at Soylent was killed and the Thorn police detective was found in the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do a research in the movie. SOYLENT is fun to watch, but the full script is a joke. It is as cheap as the entire production. The film and the over-representation of actors made the film, but they were quite joyful. It seems that everyone is a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically the policeman Thorne, who likes to go into people's apartments, inspecting the place without shame and stealing anything he wants. Personal interactions keep your eye on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN is absorbing. Pleasant piece if you have time, but do not expect anything more.
