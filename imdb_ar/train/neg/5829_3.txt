I watched this movie as a preview of Matthew Barney's art gallery. Definitely promise me. I almost missed the show, and in the past, maybe I should have. <br /> <br /> Apart from being fantastic and photography is rich in color, the content is often predictable. Jie, you desperately need to see someone wearing a pearl to see what the divers were. The film was often a silly mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology used in hunting / harvesting. The movie "reaches its peak" with enough art of unjustified trauma to transform your stomach. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? While others may argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, one can argue equally that it justifies whaling in one way or another. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "wake up" the audience with his anecdotes, feces, self-mutilation and cannibals. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Unless you really get out of Barney's artistic sense, do not bother seeing this movie. Mysterious letter, slow pace, buzz cultural references. If you are after the art of shock, you will perform better in one of the many "Undead" movies or track an old version of Hassler and capture a fecal cartoon image.
