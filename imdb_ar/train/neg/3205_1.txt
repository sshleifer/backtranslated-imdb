I've noticed from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are building their observations on MST3K. This is fair enough (that is, anyway, how I got the widest view), but after I felt bad to see "final justice" in its original form, I just shared some thoughts and comments about the uncolored version. <br /> <br /> First, you must recognize that the original version is a bit more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, primarily because of an illustration between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I use character names instead of actors, but I like writing words Venantino Venantini "), explaining why the fugitive figure of Venantini could not leave Malta immediately. (This is not a very conspicuous plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut off just for the time or because it did not provide much feed to competitors, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There is another missing point in the original picture: the flattery betrayal of Venantini Venantini to Joe Don Becker, seemingly absent in the MST3K version, is illustrated by a very unpleasant past scene where Venantini raped her in the bathroom. While this gives it impetus to the coup against him, the whole scenario is really. (There is no other word for that.) <br /> <br /> Some of the moments MST deserved (the long-standing shouts of "Son of a" and "deja vu" for the mayors) were the result of the edited print of the television they worked with, About the original film. <br /> <br /> One scene I would have liked to include in MST3K: Before entering the bar to question some people, Joe asks his Maltese police officer to stay abroad, because they "see this uniform and will not cooperate." However, Joe wears himself without the ridiculous clothes of the cowboy, complete with a shiny badge! I can not imagine why they beat this great opportunity to ridicule him. <br /> <br /> There is a final note of the unrestricted original version of "final justice": why, then, why did they feel it needed to put the butt of Venantino Venantini Naked on screen?
