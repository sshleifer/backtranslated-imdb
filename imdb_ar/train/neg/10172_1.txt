When I discovered that Noah and Eyal and Ricky Schroeder were in the same movie, I was an example! I admit, I was anxious to see the film. I must say, the first fifteen minutes or so was a bit nostalgic. Then he went all down the hill. I did not expect it to be a politically correct civil society repository. They took every controversial subject and threw it into one stupid story. I was amazed that Noah was involved in anything like that, especially his role. No one has a fully functional mind that actually accepts all these nonsense about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wanted to know how communism was, sit down and read a book on them. Not one praises it or opposes it, just hard hard facts. <br /> <br /> I've only seen a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Reiki's body, but that was all I cared about. Everything else about this film angered me.
