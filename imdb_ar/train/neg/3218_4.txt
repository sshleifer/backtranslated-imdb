I found this film to be an interesting study of the cause and effect but a little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (intentional and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The idea of ​​the film carries a great promise but I feel that it has failed to live up to its promise. It takes a lot of time to tell the public about chaos theory and very little time in fact. As a result, I never felt any real feeling and I never made any good contact with them emotionally. By the end of the film, I had a "what's that" attitude around them all. A stronger trend in character development would make this film great, but as it is now, it's just something
