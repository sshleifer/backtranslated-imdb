The murders in this film are not that bad, but definitely the film. It's even worse. It is not even worth wearing the clothes that you may cause when inserted into your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Do not even wear clothes on your shoulders that they carry from a DVD store, not talk about the money and time you spend in renting and watching it. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It is something that goes beyond understanding how anyone can say anything positive about this movie. It was just the bare masochistic tendency that led me not to stop watching, plus the pressure of the group of my fellow participants. <br /> <br /> The manuscript was horrendous, its direction worse and the representation is plain and despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see this as spoiling your fun, so I'd rather see it as a fair warning: do not waste your time watching this trash!
