As low as possible is a single star? this is shame. Really, I will click IMDb to get the "zero stars" option. To give this movie even a single star gives WAY a lot. Am I the only one to notice the microphones hanging on top of the hopper at the station? Representation, or should I say lack thereof? Obviously talent was not a factor when the casting manager came to town. My talent presentation for my younger sister's primary school offers a wider range and depth of emotion. Those fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. The only thing that could have made this movie worse was ... Oh, wait, no, no, it's really as bad as it can be.
