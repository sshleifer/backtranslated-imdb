A film about a small town in equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves, demonstrating the written dialogue, the middle representation, the green power of Gilo with the cut islands, and all the "inside Mormon joke" known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have trouble smashing this movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture would be a little amused with a chuckle here and there. You'll be better off watching other HES movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than trying to sit in this movie. Representation is average. Jared Hess had his hands on more quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend all of the movies more than whine.
