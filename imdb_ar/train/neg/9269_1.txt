Well, since seeing part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should never manufacture Part 4. Everything from a tacky, I mean a vulgar to a really bad representation, and dare anyone to watch this and not be bored of the minds . <br /> <br /> I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the atmosphere strong on a Damion, but without it in this place, it is not the same. It is certain that by the end of Part 3 I was a bit tired of the continuous story line, but it was a good closing at the end of the third part. Again, there was no reason for Part 4. Even if they could do a much better job than this job I should have sat in, lol. There is an hour and a half of my life I will never see again.
