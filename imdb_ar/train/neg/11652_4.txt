The script "Scary Movie 2" was not ready to start. This is a problem in the film is blatantly clear to both representatives and the public. Director Kenan Evori and Ian's, and many actors are funny people; so the film is not soulless. This is because the film has funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not close to being as intelligent and original as the original. <br /> <br /> The first movie "Scary Movie" was laughing in a one-minute film. The smallest detail of the bright film was transformed into comic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is heavy because it is not authentic. So they miss obvious opportunities to parody. Two movie stars are former members of the movie "Beverly Hills 90210", and this was a show that begged ridicule! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" looks like a wonderful bottle of wine that was opened very early. The script needs a lot of time for age. 2 stars of 5.
