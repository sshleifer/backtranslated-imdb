I may be one of the few viewers who do not recommend this movie. I thought visually like all the work of Ang Lee (every frame still worth printing), I was really disappointed because of the disjointed pace of the film. They were really very long. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds during the civil war in Missouri, revolving around a young man (Ruidel) who joins the Bushards' brutal forces, a kind of sympathizer of dissident Confederates who conduct gorilla fighting with Jayhawkers, their union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Paul Chiles, played by Skate Ulrich, joined the group after Chile's father was hit by an empty bullet and the burning of his house, apparently by Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures of Ruidel and Chillies, the cave and their interactions with other war victims, including the former slave who fights for the penguins (Geoffrey Wright's Daniel Holt) and Joel's war widow. <br /> <br /> It seems that every time the film develops the story into an interesting point, it turns into some other sub-plot and leaves things undeveloped. For example, the instigation between the Roedel group arises because of the participation of former Brigadier Holt in the Confederation case for a short time through some disputes concerning the validity and protocol, and then is dropped until later in the film. A young man with a fuzzy bushwacker hates Rodel and draws a lot of anxiety and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters do not appear at all; I think the reason is that the film includes a large number of them as well as eating large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical details were excellent. I loved looking at accommodation, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, although they stumbled a bit in the dialog. Unless you really enjoy history or love Ang Lee, however, take this exercise.
