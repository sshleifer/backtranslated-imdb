Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a jerky buzz, his presentation is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez was funny. I watched him and never uttered any resemblance to laughter. <br /> <br /> His objects appear in vengeance, and his animosity towards the eggs ends from every pore in his body. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the white jokes of many comedians and loved many of them. <br /> <br /> This man has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who have this show just to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> Show plots are always a cookie-cutting tool in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Canned can laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> This offer may always be due at 2 am to restart.
