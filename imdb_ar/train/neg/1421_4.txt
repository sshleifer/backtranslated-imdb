I rented a dubbed version of Lensman in English, hoping that since it came from well-known novels, there would be some articles. Although there are substantial hints in the film, it often did not rise above the level of animation for children. Maybe the film was a bad adaptation of the book, or lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe the light source novels. But for whatever reason, there was not much. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derived, dirty, poorly represented, or incomplete. Some examples: The opening scenes were borrowed from the "Star Gate" scene of 2001 and the Star Wars image in super-space. The robot looked on the harvester like a "R2-D2" stereogram. <br /> <br /> He begins by trying to borrow his own style of Star Wars relief, but happily (abandons humor) on comedy and plays it seriously. In this sense, it surpasses the Star Wars privilege, which began with an intelligent sense of humor, and eventually degenerates into a disturbing neighbor-neighborly absurdity. <br /> <br /> Agricultural details seem to have been drawn by an unprecedented person. I saw a farm. The harvester was walking in the middle of an uninhabited field, where silage was thrown on unrecorded crops, instead of working from one side to another and throwing silage on rows already harvested or in a truck. Corn (maize) flowed from the grain pits, but farmland was plotted like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight to the scene. This may have been partly the fault of the English voice actor, but the graphics did not show much weight either. Kim's reactions in this scene were similarly unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, although it was supposed to have been close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler; his name was not even named the scene of his death.) They seem to forget him immediately. Someone's expression of empathy shows a feeling more than it does. I think the voice actor deserves the most blame in this case; there is at least a hint of feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, villains fail to fulfill their requests. A wicked leader often punishes those failures with a miserable death. I can not say whether it has been lifted from Star Wars, or if it originated from a previous source - probably written by Lensman. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where the spaceship crashed. As it drowns towards the ground, cutting off the ship's parts. But many pieces fall so that there is nothing left to them as they land. <br /> <br /> While in most cases Chris looks like an efficient and difficult space hero, there is a scene in which an incompetent girl in distress loves him. Someone strong enough to overtake Henderson's death so quickly should be able to at least shout, "Help, I've got Ali and I can not get to my weapon!" Rather than just yelling. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personal (almost at times) is a DJ. law Project. He looked like Jack Wolfman, DJ. In American graffiti. I wonder if his voice is good in the original language. <br /> <br /> The planets exploded in the movie. The blasts were not spectacular, and they seemed to harbor a lot of inspiration for Star Wars. However, the cause of the blast was completely different from that of the Star of Death. The dialogue had a good and interesting explanation for this issue. Many other explosions in the film looked good, not just the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a video game in the late 1970s. Some images look like primitive video games, some of the effect of Tron is also visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are often decent, although this emphasizes the parts of the sounding sound. Art is also good, especially when it is away from computer graphics that often look exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the story. If the film tells a good story, it can escape many of the shortcomings in production. But the plot here was fairly light. A na√Øve boy tries to help someone on a paralyzed space ship and acquires a superpower that he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions are fighting against a powerful and undeniable evil enemy. He makes friends and recognizes his own power and grows to become a young man. If he is sufficiently stable and virtuous, he may defeat the evil enemy. The details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outlines, but there is not a little more in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a cartoon for kids. But then, since the primary audience is the older children, it probably does not have to be more than that.
