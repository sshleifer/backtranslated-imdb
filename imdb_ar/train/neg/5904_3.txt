With the tremendous success of "God's Army", it seems that every Mormon with a camera are trying to produce a movie now. On the other side of the sky, this was not a bad thing at all. This film, though not great, was very good. However, "The Singles Ward" is not. <br /> <br /> When the story of a young man developed from Mormon returns to individual life, the style of writing and photography in The Singles Ward is often. Ways, quite similar to the 1980s comedy "The Day of Ferris Beller". However, the similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original, and well represented (as much as stupid comedy movies like this ever), "The Singles Ward" is just the opposite. It's very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags will either be flat or cliches and jokes probably heard out a million times before. It seems that the other 10% is being dumped to fill the time. Representation, although not bad, is ambitious at best. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are not one of the Mormons, or very familiar with the Mormon culture, you will not get anything at all. While the "Army of God" and "the other side of the sky" were attractive to a wide range of viewers, inside and outside the Mormon Church, this film is certainly a big joke inside, and even if you get it, it just is not funny.
