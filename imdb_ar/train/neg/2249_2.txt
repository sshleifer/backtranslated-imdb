This is a terrible disaster for a movie. From start to finish, are filled with bad behavior, guidance and the worst liberation. The only recovered parts of the movie are a few Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem in this film is that we do not see Christoferson's character at its peak or struggling with the personality of Streisand. The first should be seen in decline and the second to rise. Streisand's final number _could- was one of the greatest endings in the film, if directed and edited correctly. The only shot framed by her face throughout the song was a fatal mistake. If the band and the audience had extensive footage of the theater being offered, this figure could have been dynamic and enjoyable. This film must have been directed and edited by a dropout from NYU Film School. The only worse thing is the miserable scenario. The last musical number is the only part retrieved from this film, and even this is completely foiled by misleading artistic decisions.
