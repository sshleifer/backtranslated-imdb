The original Japanese film "Gamira" in 1965 was http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/, essentially an update of the darkest and least child-friendly Gujira (Guadizala) for the sensitivities of the 1960s. Of course, the Gamera is a giant turtle that fires and consumes energy literally - not as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie has been edited and reviewed by the notorious Sandy Frank. Like the American version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" gets more than a misspelling. The American scenes are not as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the great Gujira, but they do add a lot to the story either because there is little follow-up on them. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a promise, there are a few scenes worthy of personal development, and there are enough characters to cause some tension outside the main plot. But once Gamera appears, the film begins to come down to the film Kaiju Mill to some extent. <br /> <br /> The representation is good enough - even the American plug-ins are fine. The steering is very good for this period and kind, and the special effects are not at all bad in their time (all miniatures). Some sets and backgrounds are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The big problem here, of course, is that there is little about this movie. However, Gamera develops a unique character in his subsequent films - most of them worth seeing if you are a fan of Kaegu.
