I give this four generosity out of ten stars, points, signs, or something. <br /> <br /> There was a huge total of really funny scenes in this film. All scenes with Amy P, Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved in an acceptable manner. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual traffic in stereotypes and glowing speed is rudely pushed by a stupid sound clip and generous "soundtrack". <br /> <br /> In any case, the two truly offensive scenes were dealing with Amy B. It's really hilarious in some kind of animal. It's a mix of that stolen man they've done on SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they will admit Amy P and Tina Fey that they did it for the money, because if they did, it was born in Sarah Palin's parody, then I think we can say yes, Black man to the role of man server, who really exists to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 outta 10 as I said are generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother in the movie "Two and a half men" in this film, and has undergone cosmetic surgery of some kind, so that now her mouth is like the mouth of a child of 30 years, so every scene is there, love the experience to rearrange her face, or put it in my mind , Or just answer the question, "No, wait, did you have plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, you do not really want to do a cosmetic surgery.
