Quite frankly, the Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. During the first 30 minutes, I sat astounded in my seat, trying to determine whether I should claim a refund. But since I did not pay for it in the first place (pass), I thought that I had stayed as well. I did not think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> This has happened. I will run quickly across the low points (including some spoilers): the terrible abuse of Casper van den as Jilin Lin, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The description was inconsistent. For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete consequence. Then there is a lame image of the completion of the Bible prophecies; we see a collection of exciting news clips accompanied by computer-ridiculously rosy of the translated Bible. Also, the terrible sequence of "motion": Lin escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and when Lynn seems to be in real danger, it turns out to be a sequence of dreams! This is nice for school grammatical writing tasks, but it is an unforgivable plot device in a moving picture. The playback speed was bad: After the long opening, the first third of the film changes the scenes every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there are still a lot of unnecessary things that jump. As another person has mentioned, years have not passed yet (not even the daughter of a small Lin). This was disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are some goodies, though. The quality of the film (such as lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. I have been shooting shots outdoors and adding a photography site to a touch of realism. Also, there are a few moments in the final part of the film when Lin calls the Lord (finally) to help him - and this has proved very gratifying - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I loved it because it shocked me as the only real scene in the film. Unfortunately, this was followed by a lack of great understanding. <br /> <br /> The characters, dialogue, direction and behavior were all bad. Michael Ironside did not have anything, and Michael York was very strange. I think the producers wanted to do a lot; if the plot was more rigid and focused, and the characterization was more embodiment, the film would be much better. <br /> <br /> In short, Omega Code is disappointing. Definitely not paying to see this. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
