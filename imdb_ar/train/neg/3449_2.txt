Fortunately, there is no video of this wannabe western who was a hounded vehicle of Frank Frank at a time when his career was stumbling upon him. The story of a weasel living on the reputation of his great brother who runs out of the city must be written by the bad guys just to return to the town crowd with new courage found by the back room clerk. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and na√Øve so that it can offend your intelligence. I have to leave completely the other references he found "... less than ..." Critics criticized him at that time and deserved him. You'll have to catch them in the last show, if you're late and take a bout of insomnia. But, if you can sit through it, you will enjoy more consistency than most of my friends in the movie.
