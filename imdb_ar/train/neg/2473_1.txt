If my grandmother made films, she might have been a much better character than this picture ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are fine. Especially since she is a nice representative mother and the baby also proves that she is nice especially in the scenes where it is supposed to be scary. But does the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller, and Good Script. The script does not have any atmosphere evolving into something impressive. If you like to be chased by trees, you might enjoy them, otherwise you can stay home and sleep. Oh ... Actually there was something funny: the movie from 2001 but we could not recognize it because the picture is very bad (like on a mini-dv) and the cars are very old (like 70 and 80).
