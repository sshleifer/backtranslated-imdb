The film was basically scrawled, but enough to notice the plot was about to be seen. To tell you the truth was boring for me and in some locations, it was not logical. The only reason I saw this movie in the first place is to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! It is very hot, but in this film his hair was strange. But it is still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite the hot CHACE temperature, it really did not make up the film. I think the plot is not that bad, but what really threw me is the fact that they were like every sentence. Is it difficult to express your anger without saying the word "F" every time? The thinking was disturbing and everything was shaking with the camera to shake me. , I found that the film carried too much. For this reason the scenes were limited only with CHACE in them. LOL In any case, the lease is not worth unless you have a hard-line fan for a particular member of the cast like me. Oh yeah the cast was spicy. The girls were hot! But CHACE is the best!
