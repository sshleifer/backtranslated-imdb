I hated this film. It was absolutely awful, poor, poor, acting effectively, REAL REAL REAL REAL READY was not the stupid fools (unlike the first two films alone were very good). All the dance traps are weak, and the pathetic excuses for badly copied ideas from the first two, which means that the people writing this film were just lazy because their salaries did not exceed $ 20 a week. This film is very poor, not even worth leasing. Actually do not watch it on TV! Go Use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I hardly give this one star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say, if you love the first two, you are not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
