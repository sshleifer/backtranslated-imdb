When it's really easy to do jungle fighting jokes, such an offer was better than making sure it contained something extra. When this extra thing is small copies of political figures that raise jokes about the future that they did not have yet, it is nonsense.

There is also Condoleezza Rice, who ridiculed Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld, who in no way resembles Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic figures rarely give their names, so it is ambiguous for anyone who can be apart from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes contain coherent stories, but this is hardly enough to prevent this from drowning.
