It was unfortunate to spend throughout the entire 102 minutes, what in my opinion, this movie is very bad. Failure at all levels greatly. The cast is terrifying, the pork at best, and the plot lacks any depth, which makes me feel indifferent towards the result of any of the complex story lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B does not enjoy any magic This type has the ability to move it and I found myself swinging physically at different points where the text makes its usual misinterpretation anywhere towards the comedy area. <br /> <br /> Dusk of the good intentions of a film.
