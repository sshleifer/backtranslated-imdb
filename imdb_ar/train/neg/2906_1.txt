It may contain spoilers ... but believe me, this film spoils from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I entered this movie with great expectations. It was my fault. You've put a lot of stock in Steve Carell's record yet. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Office. I also made a mistake in accessing IMDb and seeing 7.5 user ratings before going to the movie. It has always been a good indicator in the past, but there is no doubt that there is something recently. The last time I felt embarrassed and painfully in a cinema I was watching "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This image fluttered from start to finish. The script was a thorny subject. The writing is awful everywhere. "love killer"? "Love is the ability"? Anyone who wrote this nonsense suffered the same tragedy that hit an American Beauty writer ... she is trying hard waaaaayyyyyy hard. The entire flick is filled with the Three's Company'ish moments like a terrifying shower scene. Or a useless / confusing aerobic exercise scene. Or the laundry room scene is awful. When you think of something serious and / or real about to happen, they throw in these terrible moments. This happens again and again. <br /> <br /> What is the character of Karel? The guy meets some lame and wide in a bookstore and suddenly on top of heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. Both had to say goodbye after a few minutes. Pay attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie .... Trying a character Karel to say something random and not completely funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a child" ... that's all seriously) But both laugh so hard that the coffee is about to come out of her nose. The actors themselves seemed to be in a state of pain, wondering why they were being directed to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb item ... You need to know how players keep the promotional film team out of this site. I know it is impossible, but it is painfully clear that the first 20 reviews or reviews were published either by 12 years, or by a flunky recruited by the studio. Check out the Family Stone rating ... If this is the middle of 5, this should be 2 ... that's what drives it.
