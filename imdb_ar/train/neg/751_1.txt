I sincerely believe that anyone who thinks about making films will be exposed to this baffling failure of the mind. Such as Edward Wood Jr.'s films in the 1960s and 1970s, is a shining example of why real filmmakers spend a lot of energy-rewriting texts, re-edit their films, and rewrite their special effects to the right. This film is also a good argument for pre-screening of studios. If Mr. Heinz is forced to bear the honest reactions of a neutral audience, he may have reduced 75% or walking / running / hiking scenes and editing this movie to 90 minutes more likely. <br /> <br /> Film students should present this film as an example of how serious their thinking is "good enough". Each performance, each line of the dialog box, each digital effect, each filter effect, already each video frame reflects the risk of seeking just for mediocrity. The initial filmmaker may find himself on his own from time to time to think "at least you've done something" or "just finishing it would be an achievement in itself." This movie will help them understand how bad a movie is. <br /> <br /> Critics may also benefit from watching this film before releasing the latest summer entertainment "The Worst Movie Ever Made". <br /> <br /> Early writers can learn from this film the importance of rewriting, and may understand the need to rewrite. Also, first managers can learn the importance of a good script, and a degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotionally compelled by the story. The writers and directors who watch bad TV movies during the week and think "I can do better" can see getting an idea from this film about how difficult it is to produce modest results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as an educational tool to start filmmakers. Especially those who enter the aircraft in this current environment after Lucas and after Spielberg. There is a reason why these filmmakers praise them for their ability to have special effects. The war of the two worlds clearly shows that no one can pull it out. Some can not come near him.
