I enjoy it easily. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and many of the results, even when most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most Pauly Shore movies. There is only one film I saw I can say that it was really bad ... and that was what happened. It's been some time since I saw him, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a stupid movie. Why did you see this?" It's frankly the only film I can not recommend.
