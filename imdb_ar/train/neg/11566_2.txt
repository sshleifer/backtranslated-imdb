Maybe I could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default is OFF. When I started end credits, I could not believe it. Like the poor protagonist, but Gemayel, I felt back and dirty and cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn in the form of very wide strokes and the writer's contempt for the wealthy Thatharians. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat," but I am a little more precise. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem may be with me. I see that many others seem to find meaning or message in this picture. Unfortunately, not first. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from giving this "1" was the beautiful, human and plant scene.
