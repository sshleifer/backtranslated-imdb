A great disappointment from the writer Ham and director Dante. Their previous cooperation in "returning home" for the first season was full and delightful in all the right ways. This weak deal with the sedition hypothesis left me puzzled. The supposed "return" to foreigners who extract something from the brains of mentally ill patients was not entirely satisfactory and did not make any sense. If the aim of the story is to "clean" an extraterrestrial planet from its invasion of man, why did they do so in an unjustly sadistic and wrong way? Why not unleash the deadly virus just like the "attitude" of "Stephen King" instead of slaying the female male population? I kept hoping that the episode would improve as I continued to watch, but she became more rude. The religious text seemed simply to be compelling, but it was clear that Sam Ham should have thought he was deep because of the weight he gave him. I liked a lot of Dante and Ham's work, but it was not easy to get to.
