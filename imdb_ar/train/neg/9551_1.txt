This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I hope to come back on time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where "War" - The Dead Code "2) watched the original WAR GAMES with current computer knowledge and eyes in 1983. 3) Breakthrough the Pentagon computer in the 1980s with knowledge, perspective and memory 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER to codify the dead code site minutes before the first day of filming 5) Go back to the present, get a beer and ask Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to " "Remember my memory is completely empty." The event, especially my original "The Dead Code" 6) Keep another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the bad new version of GOOD 80 is restored. I forgot Tel jar. I'm not sure if I had to travel to the future for it. Maybe I need access to the hole.
