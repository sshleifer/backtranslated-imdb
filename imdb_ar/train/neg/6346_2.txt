Stinks this movie! You will need to restore the extra hours it takes to pass. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda tried to do much better. This film was intelligent, intelligent, and well represented. I was interested in what happened to Gwyenths - or rather the characters I played - and the performances were backed up by a wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> As Melinda & Melinda is cumbersome, the dialogue is intriguing and I may care less about any of these people - at least all of Melinda. Melinda suffers from a major dysfunction - the first glass of wine at 10 am - a melodramatic laughable, not comedic sense. Melinda II is fine, but can be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The films of Woody Allen's former band worked because, I think, he spent some time in the script and the actors were talented. One of the trivia to this film is that he wrote this script in two months: you can tell. Although Chloe Sivini is talented, those around her are not, not enough to be fully present. The film ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people who know you've seen them in other films but you can not remember any of them. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
