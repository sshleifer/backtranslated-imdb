I finally saw the INCUBUS after waiting 20 years to see it well, and it was not worth waiting for to see it. Incubus is a horror film: The invisible killer kills the women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like this: The film opens with murder. Then Blah Blah Blah. More blah blah blah. Then another killed. Even more blah blah blah. Continue Blah Blah Blah. Another kill (surprise, huh?); Blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The whole movie can be predicted from start to finish. Even the "big" red herring used throughout the film will not convince a 5-year-old child. I discovered the secret identity of the incubator the moment I saw the character, so when the sudden end came "sudden", I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I stayed in a chuckle after watching the movie. It is very ridiculous! <br /> <br /> In any event, the film will be so large that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few highlights of this dreary click. It is a distinct scene not necessarily because it is good but because it is very funny and meaningless: the film on the big screen shows a video-like moment with a man in red leather pants getting his fake long hair, which was edited with scenes of a girl being attacked in a cinema theater room. Before nursery. The best thing I can say about this movie is cinema, which I really liked. But apart from that, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about INCUBUS, but it is hilariously unintentional.
