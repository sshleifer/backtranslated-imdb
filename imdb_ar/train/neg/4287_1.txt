Timecop was given an ideal 10, I gave it this one <br /> <br /> It's a very boring story, and it has only a simple relationship to the original Timecop. Many things were canceled from Timecop, and they put it into new stupid things instead. This story happens in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason, the chronological meltdown became more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> The motion scenes are not a happy thing, and most of them are not ... the first is just fantastic. There are not many motion scenes at all, and all are very short. <br /> <br /> At one point of the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times in a few minutes ... Do not wait, make it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: do not waste your time watching this movie, it is not worth it
