Yok. I thought it strange that their old book on curses was made using a common text line instead of a handwritten script. The representation is sometimes too indifferent and overly at other times. Why does a "demonic" kill the two doctors who were alarmingly quiet and who helped make him immortal? Just for fun? Is it really necessary to show a Lilith motorcycle whenever you go somewhere? We get it! I've spent a little money to rent some third class crotch rockets. That does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith's" cache is similar to the Battlestar Galactica school in the old school with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where we were introduced to a few people in a talk show for 30 seconds before being killed for no apparent reason and without importance. Everyone with a forgotten character and even a more desperate plot makes it one of the most misguided films seen by SciFi. Stay away unless you are in bad movies.
