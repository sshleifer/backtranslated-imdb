"Do not bother watching this movie" would be better advice, if you love Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a great disappointment considering the wonderful staff, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was nothing, and certainly nothing as described in the VHS box, of course. There simply was not much suspense, excitement, and a lot of dull sites, and most of them were trying to show why they were spoiling "Indigo" (Monroe). This was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not need to see this character to know that she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was good enough evidence. But this role was not appropriate for her, and it is not surprising that she was not one of her most popular films. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad film, with actors such as Richard Widmark, Ann Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jenny Kani, Donna Kokuran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
