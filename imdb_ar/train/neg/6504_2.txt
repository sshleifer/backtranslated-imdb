Why do I spend 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why made this film? Why do I even comment on this film? <br /> <br /> One of the reviewers said that the film took patience to watch and was not for everyone. I can not tell who this movie is. Maybe after dropping a group of acids, there could be something, you can watch this and make it logical. It is not coherent, it is not experimental, it is simple and simple garbage. The movie does not follow any landline at all, just when you think you have something, well ..... you do not do it. <br /> <br /> I think the end has brought some final touches to the film (not intended as a pun), to get the viewer a glimpse of what might happen. I do not think I put the spoiler here, it does not matter. This film is another must miss in the film world.
