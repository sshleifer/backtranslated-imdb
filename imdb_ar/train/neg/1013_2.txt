If you see this movie, you know why you said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hey! Every time they say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did you rent this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners such as Freeman and Spissy appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J took the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaming Representation! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a lot better! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I'm not having fun with him ... but I'm really a better actor, not this robot called Timberlake. His girlfriend was shallow and hollow and nagging like hell. I was happy when they both appeared on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was good and I think Dylan Mac Dermot has played the bad guy very well. The movie was fun but I think Timberlake ruined everything. It would be very fun without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was fine, but suddenly every time she appeared the music turned the movie into an MTV video clip with flashes and low movement and things like. Something out of place for this police film I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video for Timberlake.
