It's been a long time since I've seen this comedy, and I've forgotten how foolish it is. I would easily put this in two or three of Elvis Presley's worst films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, an Indian bull rider from half of the dynasty who returns to his home in Arizona and the cracker where his family lives, where his friends love to celebrate all night long. His parents play Burgess Meredith and Katie Grado, and his old Indian grandfather Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything substantial, be it guidance or otherwise. The government has invested in cattle family, but lacks bull. Elvis gets very few worthless songs, followed by a crazy young girl and her mother carrying arms. This is just a real slap of chaos, and the dilapidated environment is practically spread out of compost and does not make it much easier. The only thing that puzzles me is that Elvis seems to be having a good time in the film. It is hard to believe, given that he is very upset by his failure to produce many modest films.
