Predictable parody, almost failed to influence the entire time it took eight minutes. The only thing that made it worthwhile is the non-coloring line at the end of the credits. Nothing more enjoyable has been put on the DVD, such as Jonathan Ross' interesting profile of Rommero on "The Incredible Movie Show".
