Have you seen this movie really HeidiJean? Great Christmas movie? Not so close. Boring, cute and totally lacking in imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought Carly Bob could play a role in this movie! Women have no detectable personality and give very poor performance. Baranski was fantastic as usual and gave the only little interesting of all. Perhaps her participation was the only reason why the project was lit green. I might have expected too much of the 15-day Lifetime, but I sat through this, believing that with a different director and a DJ who were being re-represented with an actress who could at least be sympathetic, it would have been a very nice little film.
