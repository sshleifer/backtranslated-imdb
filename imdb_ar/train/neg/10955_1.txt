This is the story of two men who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". It seems that finding this is strange while he discovers that there are still posters for the film at the local Odeon Cineplex. After seeing classic movies such as "Every Every Way But Loose" and "Project X," these two men were considered wonderful films with great monkeys. <br /> <br /> These two men were on a long journey while watching this movie. There was some monkey that was replaced by Stunt MAN when action sequences were required. It was obvious that the monkey had not trained at Shakespeare School. Replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck may have helped men to think. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be helpful to help a strong sidekick like Jackie Chan or even Hulk Hogan. Luckily, this film had a great military artist like Matthew Modine. Although some may argue that Matthew Modine does not approach Jet Li, camera tricks prove he is in good shape. When it becomes clear that a non-trained chimpanzee can not handle the film, the film tends to be Matthew Moden's real star. <br /> <br /> Have you mentioned that there is a small child developing in association with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the child will learn to trust and even pick up a girl in this film? Matthew Mudin must be jealous of this (because using the pick-up line "I'm a second violin for a monkey" does not seem to work with the ladies.) Shortly after watching this film, the two men got a phone call from Matthew Modin tells them "seven days".
