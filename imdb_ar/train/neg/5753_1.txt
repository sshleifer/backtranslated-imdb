... Although the film seems to be trying to market itself as a horror, there has been a clear lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of skilled skills, direction, editing, and script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London has put in one of the most horrifying performances I've ever seen in my life - "getting into the crazy craziness" self-conscious and suffering from malice. Hey look at it twitch! Hey take a look at it drink strong spirits! Hey take a look at him raise his forehead, and cock his head in a flashy corner! Oh look at his dark hair is not washed, greasy! Hey listen to his husky voice affected! Must be a talented artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the Poet's shirt comes - he's another boy he thinks he's. (Or Poe.) Oh for love ... Did someone give this guy proof of "How To Act Good" or did they pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, awarding a small old plastic toy at its stop Brand Grain Deal Ben. Well, that was a stupid mistake - but that's only because the performance of London has melted away terribly. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a nice, glamorous rose, but has not yet turned into her representative shoe in this film - she made her lines as if she were hanging, in fact, her performance was all very woody, and her shape was as harsh as her lines - Maybe she was only interacting with Jeremy London's attempt to neutralize her. The excesses, but if that is the case, it is very much cut. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that Ari Vervin is a bo - while the role of his personality is confused, it offers the best performance of the piece. It just seems true, but more than that - it has a kind of depth, and I think it has a life that transcends the bleak quality of the other two characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I love boo, so I can let my mind go around and invent when he was on the screen - whatever, he had a missing attention factor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are missing obliterated obscurity - there are all the usual cartoons: the friendly blonde girlfriend is a little better. The smiling local cop who looks a bit like. The older man who receives great attention from our heroines; the ancient scheming witch, etc., etc., yawning, yawning. <br /> <br /> As with the case of "The Clear Blood Deficiency of the Horror Movie," none of the topics they mentioned (which the London character remembers - bitterly - in his attack on the writing of Bo). As another reviewer said - there was a possibility here: murder, incest, - things are really horrible, but instead they move away from the issues, and get away from violence (a high candlestick swings in the air - closes its victim - and then cuts to black! This is wonderful in the traditional horror of Nuerish, in fact, it is expected, and is greeted with pride when it happens - it is dear, especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and Siouxie's intense makeup for the eyes - but in a "concession" appears only as clumsy, or as if The editor felt upset at the last minute and cut it.) This could have been either a very tense psychological stirring - horror of inflammation / aloe / Madness - or simple (and fun) movie slasher: Trying to be both or not (something new and exciting!), But in both cases fail terribly. The only element of horror in this entire film is that it is epic. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there is one at all) should be drunk when he / he cut this thing - it was embarrassingly thwarted by scenes; scenes that looked out of order (but it was possible To be just a bad text). LIkewise for the director and cinematographer - there were some weird shots and frames that I thought were aimed at honoring Hitchcock or Browning, but I ended up being silly (again, good at Nawar, but this was trying to be something else.) /> <br /> Maybe it was all funny (this way former reviewers mentioned - "OMG how do you make this?!?") If you are in the mood for some garbage - bags, unfortunately for me you have settled on the couch, , An explicit structure to scare myself silly - this is a very bad film, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to people, not even to laugh. <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not waste your time or money in this - either borrow a real horror / suspense movie, or find yourself a copy of the fictional Bo Tales, either way, you will have a more enjoyable and scary night Far more than you can hope to achieve with this garbage.
