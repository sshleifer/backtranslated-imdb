This film, by Oscar Peterson, is unique. Its uniqueness lies not in the story, as many of Hollywood's semi-deceptive productions have served us as rather miserable plots, but in a comprehensive way the full and extended softness of one side has been tied in equal spirit in all other respects. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is worse than embarrassing. The corrupt representation and the deep trend are thrown into the mix. The Bosnians, who speak English in heavy Swedish dialects, add an unintended element of humor. Lightning and uninspired camera work out the turkey cake. As a surprise to the public, there are a few slow motion sequences that are not completely stimulating and you do not expect them at all. To give insult to injury, everything is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing. <br /> <br /> The scene of "a bad man turns into a good state after listening to a good man's speech" in the church is the point at the right time to keep Ed Wood away from the post of director of the worst times. Move Ed Wood - Here comes Oscar Peterson!
