This film is deeply stupid. A man wants revenge to commit a crime - but when he gets revenge - there is a video camera pointed directly at him all the time. What is sitting there a man with a brain cell in his head and doing it for a long time in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can never happen except with someone who is unable to wear his clothes has ruined him for me - but he has become a fool !!! <br /> <br /> I think the script writers have some dangerous habits that cook their brain cells and make them miss the holes of a plot you can command the armored tank battalion through. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: A man seeks revenge for the death of his loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something completely wrong happens, and then unforeseen things unfold. <br /> <br /> If only those people who write this story are not so stupid that they write a totally unrealistic conspiracy that can never happen in this way. To the writers I say, seek help for your serious mental problem.
