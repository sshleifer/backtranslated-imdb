Well, what can be said about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast on cable. I am sorry to waste my time but I did not waste money at least. <br /> <br /> The creature is the most beautiful thing you can get! Please, you have to be very generous so do not get angry from CHEAP Halloween costume. Well, there are also terrible representations, f / x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can not get a more pathetic sight. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from direct video clicks. "The Unknown Creature" makes FULL MOON PICTURES like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at any price, please. The only "positive" thing about this garbage is the sexy women.
