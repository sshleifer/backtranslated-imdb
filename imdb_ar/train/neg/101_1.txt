Amateur, budget movies can not be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, the other awful Brad Sykes. Representation is hideous, except for Amy Smith who shows some promise. The camera "direction" needs serious rework. And no more than "Hold the camera and run" tricks either. It just does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem when the effect can be determined in real time. If you are disowned, please do not let us see the real actor's ear under the blood. The scene is nice and boring (like Mr. Sykes's other projects), and music is a cross between cheap motel porn and a really bad metal metal (see scene commentary). <br /> <br /> Have you mentioned the absence of any real plot, or personal development? It seems that the scriptwriter did not. <br /> <br /> Everyone who finances this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not connect) and they are very bad. Usually, the "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be a way out, but anyone can be a hacker. <br /> <br /> Surely there will be even a popcorn film ... Of course, chewing popcorn beads will be less painful than this effort. <br /> <br /> Award: The worst military payments in the film.
