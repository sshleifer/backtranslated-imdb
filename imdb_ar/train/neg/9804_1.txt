The Power Rangers, the innovative Moroni TV program for children of the 1990s, must be the most senseless and absurd television program ever created. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this offer exactly anyway, other than selling in second place. Rate plastic nonsense for children? There is nothing even after you recover or show this program remotely anyway. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes, which look like lost spandex. <br /> <br /> The mural hair, earrings and fashion earrings of the early 1990s look quite ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this offer at all costs!
