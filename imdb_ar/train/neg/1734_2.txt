I'm a big fan of old Westerners, and I do not think Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help the 1957 film, which carries almost all the rude features of the West from a reformed fighter turned into a good man. A fallen but virtuous woman, a fanatic city dweller who must turn to the fighter for salvation, and so forth. Any favoritism there? I've seen acting better in high school plays. Chill Wills plays an animated character for Chill Wills. Have you reached 1000 words yet?
