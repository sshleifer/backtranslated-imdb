I must be quite honest in saying first that I am sleeping somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a full opinion about the film until I see it full. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sir Carter (Sir James) and Ernie Prague (Bernard Breslau), are planning to earn a fortune to steal a shipment of pills from the Finisham maternity hospital. This is where Matron (Hattie Jacques), along with faculty members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor) work. Patients and their patients are also present, including Mrs. Tidey (Joan Simms) and her nervous husband, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Welling. This plan by the way does not work by the way, because all employees object to the road. That's all I can say about the film until I see it again. Okay!
