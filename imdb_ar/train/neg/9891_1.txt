I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that, to the very end, I was expecting the acting coaches to apologize and apologize for the misrepresentation of the actor. When you think of a strong subject, wonderful landscaping and effort to create a wonderful collection and stunning images, it is a shame that little attention has been paid to the work. <br /> <br />
