Within the science fiction world, there have been two themes of constant interest that were initially explored in pre-cinematic literature and have since been periodically reviewed by directors and writers alike with varying degrees of success. The first theme, travel through time, was an unbridled fascination for film lovers, as well as the written word, which recently appeared on screen with another version of the classic LG Wells program, Time Machine. The second theme, which also succeeds in keeping the masses in the throne, is the concealment, which imagines innumerable possibilities and innumerable possibilities. This theme also became the basis for a film adapted from the other classic HG Wells, "The Invisible Man," an investigation here, "A Hollow Man," directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Choi. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caen (Bacon) and his colleagues have been experimenting with the US government for some time, exploring the possibility and secretive process they eventually achieved in a number of presidents who tested their method. In fact, they have advanced to such an extent that the influence on the hidden is guaranteed; their only problem now is to return the subject to the original "visual" state. However, the problem of Caine, after an arduous effort and long hours in the laboratory, has been solved - or so believed. When the application of his theory succeeds on a direct subject, he decides to submit the results to the Board of Directors, in an attempt to maintain the necessary funding to continue the project. <br /> <br /> At the last minute, though, the Cayenne demurs, fearing that it will be controlled from the project before they can proceed to the next level - testing a human subject. It takes it upon himself to become the subject, and provides the assistance of his research team by telling them that they have received approval from the board of directors to do so. But there is something wrong, and Ken is trapped in the cloak of secrecy. As he and his team struggle to find a solution to his big problem before it is too late, it all begins to affect Ken. Suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes illogical, because he finds himself facing imminent danger of losing much more. Now there is a very real chance that he may lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven initially designed an exciting and thought-provoking film; proves good speed and uses F / X at his disposal to a large extent, although he tends to let the amazing images overwhelm the evolution of character. Anyone familiar with the "invisible man", or indeed anyone who can follow the story logically, will know early on that Ken is not heading for happier times. However, Verhoeven has a storytelling style that will certainly attract attention and attract audiences. But seems intent on rushing to the peak of the peak, and along the way abandoning any and all of the nuances that made his film successful so far, and chose to enter the final sequence is nothing more than the blood and gore festival betraying his audience and everything worked previously in the film. Instead of searching for a clever solution to the suffering of Caine, the use of some creativity and imagination to move the film to its inevitable end, Verhoeven takes the low road, and although it may succeed on a purely floral level, any meaning one can derive from the story melts like a lot of ash in the wind, Along with anything that would make this movie memorable. It is shameful, because Verhoeven has a much higher level than what is offered in this genre, and allows him to unnecessarily drown into one much lower. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a believable personality, on the surface only, which apparently serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly. There is little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it is more about his manager's agenda than his acting. Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon time to develop Kane to any extent; personality is essentially a container that Verhoeven can build his story, and works for that end. However, it would have been possible to present the film better if Verhoeven and Bacon had been at least as close to the development of an association between Caen and the public that would have aroused some emotional involvement by viewers, which would have attracted them a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, As observers only of the magnificence of the F / X. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Choi is well on the role of Linda McKay, partner of Caen partner in the disease. Experience the fate, but it is basically a thankless part presents a little challenge, especially for the representative of the caliber Shue. The same can be said of Kim Dickens (very cool in the 2001 film, "Things Behind the Sun"). Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does more than just support the movement and F / X. Both actors are much more capable and deserve better than they do here. <br /> <br /> The support team includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnik (Frank) Mary Randall (Janice) and William Devan (Dr. Kramer). Somewhat entertaining, and to be successful at a certain level (low), "Hollow Man" is one of those movies that makes you think about what it can be. Such as the annual fireworks display, will give you some instantaneous excitement, but after a while you will begin to integrate with all the other games you have seen, without anything special to distinguish. This is very bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been much more. I rate this one 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
