I have absolutely no knowledge of Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical in her work, I may have had a great interest in her books as a child. When I was a child, I was not really interested in retaliation unless there were soldiers fighting the full monsters with a large body. <br /> <br /> From this TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN film version, I think Pierce writes for less middle class children because Much of the story revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving into a house with no garden and then suddenly finding one metaphysical. Having a private garden is not something that the working class did not have in the 1950s, so I think there are some political texts full of political class there somewhere. There is also a romantic love story involving a young girl named Hattie, but again, there are children of irony stories of love? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little excitement or adventure occurs within the novel <br /> <br /> It is a children's film that appears dated by its source. It is not aggressive but I was surprised by its high ranking by the IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have achieved a great number of high marks if they were ten years old who had just seen a triptych lord?
