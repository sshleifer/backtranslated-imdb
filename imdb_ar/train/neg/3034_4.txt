This movie contains a large number of big stars, but fails to make you interested in how the adult film should. Of all the stars, you can not get your kicks from any of the scenes. The film was filmed in a dream like the middle-aged group is an embarrassing cheesy. The worst representation of Keanu Reeves, sexy sex scenes like listening to your neighbor talk about their child in college, the dialogue is the worst I've seen in a movie. The plot was also ten times worse. I will follow the path of amateurs. The voice comment was useless because it was a flick but even that was so bad. Unless you have a fanatic Geena Jamson fan there's a little here. 10/04
