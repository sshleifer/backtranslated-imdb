This movie is just a flick average motion, but it could have been much better. When the guns went out, they needed some help in designing the dances. A person like Andy McNab - who made the wonderful sequence of motion in Heat as he moved out of the street from theft - could have turned tedious work sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was good - predictable but viewable - better than you would expect from this kind of movies. Then came the last scene, the show, the scene we were waiting for, but it was like watching something from the team in the eighties. They shoot violently, do not hit, they run around a house trying to kill each other - same age, same age.
