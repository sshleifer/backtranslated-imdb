This film is exaggerated, predictable, buzzing, and even hollowed out. The settings are sincere to the age but are self-conscious in magnifying them through long exposures. The remaining works of art are no longer working, and it just fades like empty dialogue. It seems that Tom Hanks was walking during sleep as Bruce Willis did in the Hartz war. Tom, you can not give depth to a personality simply by making your face empty! The content did not justify the stunning representation by Paul Newman. This is wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.
