We have all seen some epic never ending in our time, but this story tops them all! The film is very long and very slow, so, just to put things right, I felt older when I left the cinema, more than I entered. About 4 hours later, it was possible to convert it to a remote series. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses its tempo. Nikhil Advani has woven the plot about 6 stories of love and can not bring justice to any of them ... There is no correlation between them to begin, and the links that appeared in the last 20 minutes appear to be binding on the story. <br /> <br /> The situation is getting worse through silly dialogues (mostly in Indian cinema over the years) and stupid cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that she really needs to play a role instead of just looking at the sedition on the screen ... a complete waste of beauty without acting skills. <br /> <br /> Then there is Juvinda loud and humorous face-to-face. - Kari Akshay Khana, who continues to roam the top of his lungs to really anger the viewers. <br /> <br /> The good part of the film is the love story of John & Vidya and the gentle comedy / acting of Suhail and Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these couples could justify the film without confusing it with another group of characters. Their brilliance is lost amid other substandard plot lines. <br /> <br /> My guess - the director was making two separate films (maybe more!) and some novice assistants are mixing all the records, beyond their point of selection, so the director had no choice to show him as a single film ... < /> <br /> See it only if you want to test your patience !!!
