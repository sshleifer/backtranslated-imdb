I was not impressed with this film especially because I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to watch a movie that was rated on the 12A certificate here in the UK. This film has been horrified by embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it is not good to watch with children). This movie was sometimes very rude sometimes with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin and others ... For the most part the film is not very funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims is a 2-inch dwarf, gets out of jail and steals Massa but is forced to put him in a women's handbag. So the rest of the film sees him die in himself as an abandoned child and enters this female home so he can recover this diamond. <br /> <br /> So far, I have enjoyed most of the production from Wayans Brothers - but this movie definitely takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> Good advice - Wait until it's displayed on your TV or cable
