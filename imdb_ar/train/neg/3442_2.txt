I have rented this film purely on the fact that the cover is appealing to me. But once I started the film I felt sorry. They seem to have used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a little boy do it. They also used inappropriate forms and forms to try to intimidate people, but I found myself laughing. I could have put it together and performed a better job. <br /> <br /> As for the plot I felt it had some really good ideas but because of the dodgy lines and in some cases, it was blocked. I had no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit in it all because it caused physical pain to see it but I always ended up, so I took a deep breath and kept it going. Certainly 98 minutes of my life is lost. <br /> <br /> I would like to save yourself from the embarrassment of knowing that you saw a "haunted boat" and find something more enjoyable. I am a fan of low-budget horror films, but this was very disappointing, I thought that nothing could get worse after the "terrorism charges", but that made me reconsider. A fails to this type. <br /> <br /> * From ***** (the star is the thoughts of having the worst fears they have for them)
