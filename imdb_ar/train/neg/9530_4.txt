I think this movie depends on a kind of real story ... It's about two little girls who molested a big man for 48 hours; I do not see where the horror plays here ... There are some "alien" and "surreal" series in the movie, The two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... well) roll two psychopaths to the finish ... They do a very good job (although some are just a boy on top). The film is not good, and it is not terrible; it's really dated! I mean this thing drips in the seventies ... it's not really bad if you like this kind of stuff ... you know ... that tang?
