Maybe TV will be brutal one day. "Big Brother" may have been the first step in the direction that Stephen Richard Bachman King described at the end. But enough about that. If I spend a lot of words talking about the serious background of this film, I do exactly what the producers were hoping for. It's the same with "Day Six". No matter how primitive the film, it raises a discussion about its theme, which serves producers as propaganda. Let's not take it. The social criticism suggested by the plot's summary is only an excuse to make the production of a violent film more violent, more to sell than video to film. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw the film I thought they could not produce a terrible film from a good book: in the 1980s a typical 80s music with some young actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a cop escaping the killers on a tough TV show. The audience cheers. <br /> <br /> Along with? Predator, this is certainly the most stupid Schwarzenegger movie. 2 stars of 10.
