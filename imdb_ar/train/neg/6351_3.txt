Potential spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was some good acting - especially Cluj Sivini and her father Mitchell in the comedy half - it was not an attractive film. The passages between the comic part and the tragic part were embarrassing or sometimes unclear. I thought about the way things were put in the opening scene that people around Melinda would be the same people, just react differently (more than a hypothesis, "Said said). However, what we have is two completely different stories and two completely different women, both of which happen to be played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The demonic writers in the opening scene - comedian and tragedy - assume the same premise and moved from there, but the two stories are closely linked. They do little to support the debate, that almost anything can be seen as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing film.
