Another violent film, angry from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: It's hard to tell if he takes his hard drives seriously, with a sarcastic intention or working in total oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the wonderful visual images in the world (including some outstanding images) can not hide neglect in story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovers disappearance and uses it to push himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a lovable actor who sometimes shows his dark side ("wild river") in an attempt to make up his childish looks; given the material, however, the bacon is not hate enough to force. The other directors are Elisabeth Choi and Josh Brolin, both talented enough to make a strong impression and who embarrass themselves when forced into an unfair dialogue. Its climax is a study of the predominance and disbelief must really be attached.
