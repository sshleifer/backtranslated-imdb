"Little Man", now on DVD, is floundering in Wayans Brothers. It's a smaller story than a dwarf criminal played by Marlon and Ayans, who hides diamonds in a lady's wallet after a robbery. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, devised a genius plan to hide Marlon as a child and plant her at the lady's house. Then goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" such as the chaos to restore the gem and treat it as a baby. I was surprised by the low humor in this film. The jokes have been elsewhere many times, so that is not nice or funny. I almost think that the film might have been more entertaining if CGI was not used and used the little actor pasted on Marlon's face. In watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in a Mini-me manner, but they chose a different path. Some logos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes .. Spend the rent on $ Borat if you want some real laughter these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
