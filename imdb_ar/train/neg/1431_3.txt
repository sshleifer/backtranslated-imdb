!!!!! Potential spoiler !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think that the story involving Archie Gray Owl - an English man who represents a red Indian - will have a lot of humor. In fact, I will say that the only way to deal with such a film, where a wonderful man deceives the naive audience is to treat him as a comedian. However, Richard Attenborough committed something closer to the crime by making Gray or WL a serious drama. Even worse, he made a very difficult film too. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the role of the title, and the romantic sub-plot between Gray Owl and Bonnie (played by Annie Gobo) is lacking any kind of screen chemistry. But to be fair in the team, they did not help with writing, who failed to portray Archie as a cheeky snooper who fooled everyone into believing he was an American citizen. The producers and the scriptwriter have made the main mistake in making the center of the film about Twist an Archie plot for being an Englishman - which is why I wrote a "potential spoiler" that he did not reveal until late in the film that the title character is English, but it is clear that everyone who saw this The film knew there was no surprise at all. <br /> <br /> Yes I agree with everyone that the scenery is beautiful and that it has a great depth environmental message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if the truth were told. We must also remember that except for the movie GREEN SOYLENT (and perhaps the two towers if you want to classify the message as containing a green message), there was no really wonderful environmental film. In fact, most eco-friendly films include GRAY OWL, a film that is not surprising to have a serious problem finding a distributor
