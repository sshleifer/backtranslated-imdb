** Potential spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This direct chaos is brought to the video between a heavily armed heroine, Z-class effects, nazes, and mummy-like stills that are endless and still boring; the 45-minute playtime looks like Eternity. The only good part is one of the mysterious attempts, when the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptian specialist on the chair - crushing the foot of the villain almost under the arm of a chair. Take this nap back to the video store and watch golf, bowling, or televised tennis instead.
