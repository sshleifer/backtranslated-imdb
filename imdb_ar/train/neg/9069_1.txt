It seems that the script (David H. Steinberg) initially contains some real smart points that could have made a good romantic comedy, but, my dear! What happened in the road ?? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Burke - 1982). Although that was a long time ago, but these are the pioneers, the godfathers of this new genre: the raw teenager comedy. Then came the nineties. After the important cases that have become overwhelming success (eg, Child Child - 1990), Dumb and Dumber - 1994 (The Nutty Professor - 1996) and There Something About Mary - 1998 I think that evaders are affected, There was a summit of the era and the Apostle of the following era, only one: (American Pie - 1999) which is undoubtedly the genre icon. After that, I think that every comedy of this kind must be very dirty, benign and vulgar, to be admired by young people or else you may be old! <br /> <br /> I think Slackers had the smart plot first as a scenario, and then its makers added a lot of realism: the audacity, the filth, the strange shameful sex that must be done - in those days - as easily as pie! Such as having to fill every scene with marine elements such as: masturbation, oral sex, urination .. etc just to look at the situation. They are absolutely unnecessary elements of the story, but they are certainly necessary for making profits, and for the latest in making teen comedy movies. The problem is how to replace it all with any potential comedy. <br /> <br /> Some of her moments seemed literally horrifying, and that's what you see is the bottom line. Everything in (Jason Schwartzman) has performance. Do not forget the most disgusting. So ambition turned from being a romantic comedy to making what did not happen before the appearance of soft pictures. To be terrifying as you ask all the time; What will happen worse? (Vomiting, irritation, etc.); this is the easiest group to create comedy these days. <br /> <br /> Although if you hate to love something (often for being bold), the scene for me is Gina Gershon. In any case they designed it as a whole to achieve outrage versus outrageous, like the dream of a naughty teenager. Although most of them were close to anyone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad is that this film in essence was a real potential act, not another stupid cheap comedy because it finally managed to be. Remember the details of the theft of the exam (the first two minutes), so the master planner of the film (eccentric trying to reach a girl by blackmailing nice players) through the style (the boy loves the girl, loves the girl another girl) because of keeping it, . I dealt with her stuff in a way of a bunch of dirty boys who did nothing but do mummified jokes and did. It ended up to be, I'm sorry to say it, smiling smiling. <br /> <br /> At the end of it said something (can you imagine!) About how time and place are also to win the antichrist or recession, just like this comedy Itself. It looks good until the end for another perfectly better film; which can assure my opinion about this one smart one .. Once! It does not take much to understand that the makers of this film were real dodgers! Maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if it was .. The end result here was not at least ingenious in any sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Note: The screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story of American Pie 2, has a home page in IMDb where you will find under the heading "Additional Details" his usual "conspiracy keywords" Are: sex / vulgarity / raw humor / ... I just forgot to write urinating while showering or Baring 70 years old women!
