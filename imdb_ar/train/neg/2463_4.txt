I do not know how to describe this film. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I have seen in a long time. It is sometimes very disturbing but also boring elsewhere. Teeth torture scenes are very complex and may attract anyone suffering from tics. I found myself carrying my teeth through some of the above scenes. The smart thing about the film is that it plays with our fears and so The Dentist is very worrying. <br /> <br /> The humor of the film is somewhat hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you love exotic and wonderful entertainment and dig your teeth in a dusty place, this is the movie you're just looking for. <br /> <br /> If you have read the comment and feel the attraction of this kind of entertainment, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit weird for my taste)
