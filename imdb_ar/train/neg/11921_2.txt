I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. A very predictable way to line a story with the possibility that it is funny but instead lies on its face. However, see, 19 words, I did not hold this whole star with just one star, but instead decided to collide with two stars because of the fact that Julie Bowen smoked hot and gave me enough eye candy to prevent me from ripping a DVD directly from the device and detonating it With the M80. My advice is to take the $ 4.00 rent you would pay to watch this movie, then send it directly to me in advance, thank you for saving time and frustration from sitting in the train wreck, or you might want to send it to me instead of the $ 50.00 replacement fee you will be charged Out of twelve measures to use this piece of waste as a practice to fire on the skate.
