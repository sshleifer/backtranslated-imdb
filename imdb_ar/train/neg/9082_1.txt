This is the worst film I have ever seen. I was fooled into thinking that it might be good because two of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to press Jason Schwartzman in the face of this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really do not understand Hollywood at times. There are a lot of people trying to break into, and I'm sure you can get out of the top and get the best. In this way, the worst film you play is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. He added gags like a hair doll and ripped off the commercial jeans business blatantly to the horror of the film. Happy I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid the January versions at any price.
