Unless you are already familiar with pop stars who represent a star in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review after it reaches the end of the following sentence. <br /> <br /> We forget that you previously stumbled on FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETINGING ELSE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, think about it: <br /> <br /> A lame vehicle for beautiful boys from teenage boys presents an illogical and complex "plot" drawn out for an unbearable period until Be ready to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is logical. It is an endless series of people who express different feelings, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, without good reason. Obviously we see that something "incredible" happens incredibly, but we do not give up the reason why there is no background play. <br /> <br /> By the time this movie ends, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, starry faces. You will feel upset because you spent all this time watching her smile, mock, cry, look obscure, be "serious," and any other meaningless slapping him on their faces. <br /> <br /> Ever goes so far as to refer to this piece of garbage as unclear as the "spirit" of any of the "actors" that must prove to you beyond any doubt, what will not tell you Countless videos and countless comments on this site: <br /> <br /> This movie will only love non-converted, mostly adolescent girls who love anything satisfactory. Freud will take a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of these "crazy fans", keep the hell away from this abomination.
