If not for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this "B" movie will not be worth a single segment of the Tivo disc space! In a low rent, was the rear lute warehouse photographed in space? "Continuity of people!" It's a fundamental principle in making real movies! At night the alleged space port and day (day and night on the space station?) Warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I will praise about this movie is the wardrobe section. Continuously, keep the natassia in that narrow shape reveal the clothes! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the clothes they spent some time clearly, every day of filming! The science fiction channel was better off in the SpaceBalls show! At least there was some real humor in watching something incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please shoot your agent as soon as possible! You are much better than the actor, so you are associated with this level of filmmaking.
