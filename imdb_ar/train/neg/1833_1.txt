Please, someone stopped Ben Stiller from acting in any film. Write studios, hell, type your local congressman up. I've got more laughter going to a funeral then I watch no flick. Jack Black is trying to do something about comedy about the disappearance of dog nonsense. Christopher Whelken, perhaps the greatest actor of his generation, seems embarrassed to be there. Still the same is uncommon, but so far with someone to save him, proves that it is exaggerated comedy way. No wonder why this movie went bad and was available in theaters in dollars only a few weeks later. Gautica (personally, I never thought of saying that), the worst of Plan 9, Worst Ishtar, the worst and then the Golden Child. Please Hollywood, quit Ben Stiller in your movies, it's not funny, he's a terrible representative of God, he takes away others with him. The next film was ranked first because there are no negative results allowed, so while one painting says, I'll give it a zero.
