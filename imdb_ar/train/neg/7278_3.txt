This film was hardly a little viewer of the ordeal to sit down. None of the slides were good, but the first part was at least moderately amused, and the middle part was fairly creative. The last game was just plain brutal, and after sitting through two weak comedic strips, the third episode was very painful to watch. Even under the low standards of National Lampoon, this film seemed boring and ruthless.
