I was very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us who saw it in one show and we all went out. We felt personally that it was too slow to see it and we could not watch the whole movie. We tried to really stick to it. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like them because of their personal experiences with Westernization of sexual orientation in the school years they filmed did not like or like her at all. :( <br /> <br /> However, it is great to see that this film has a great resonance with a lot of people here on the paintings and with the reviewers.This is the beauty of the art form of the film. :)
