This film is so stupid that it simply turns into a ridiculous angle. I wanted to watch the "Dark Fall" in fact I think this is the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I was referred as quickly as I could and I still can not get rid of the dull moments. I just envy people who have been paid to play or work in this movie. They have been given money for this nonsense. Is not that amazing? In this film I mean the killing of a man and cutting him in the wood mill into small pieces of blood. After a few minutes, the mother and child quietly talk on the table where nothing happened and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money to such crap movies? Oh, the "fairy teeth" was lame. It was not scary at all and it was obvious that he was a dull man wearing a bad make-up.
