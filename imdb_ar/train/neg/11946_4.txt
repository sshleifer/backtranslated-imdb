"Running Jumping & Standing Still Film" is not a movie like this, but a short series of comedies. This film got Richard Leicester, and paved the way for him to direct the Beatles' first film: "A Hard Night". <br /> <br /> Richard Leicester wrote music for his first film in 1959. This film was titled Running, Jumping, and Standing Cinema, and was supposed to be shown only by those who helped produce it, Leicester and his partners alone are looking at a small amount of money. The only purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it was an experience to work in the camera. The film cost Â£ 70 and was filmed in Dark Brown. In the Sunday field, all the footage filmed in the final production is included; the final production is 11 minutes long. <br /> <br /> The Running, Jumping, & Standing is still a comedy about English Sundays and the little hobbies people do to spend time e. All events in this film are taking place in the field. Some of these comedies include a woman cleaning grass, a man running around a tree trunk with a needle to set a record, a cameraman filming a movie in a pool, an artist helping him draw figures in an exhibitor's face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, He holds a gun. Not only does the film make fun of people's hobbies to spend time away, but it also makes fun of English culture when compared to American culture. Another one of the many events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, constructed from the UK flag. One of the men jumps inside the kite as the other men try to fly, and the kite collapses. According to Nell Cineard, author of The Films of Richard Lester, this event symbolizes the UK as less power and technology than the United States during the space age. According to this scene, Britons fly with primitive kites while the Americans fly, the world power after World War II, with highly sophisticated missiles and space shuttle.
