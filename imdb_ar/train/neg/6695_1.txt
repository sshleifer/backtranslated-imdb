I've had something for Carrie's chick for a while, and as far as I look at this movie, there are no complaints. But after picking up last night at the High Definition, I'm sure: this is the only thing in the film that does not live up to the required level. The script is terrible, the representation is terrible, the trend is terrible. In another comment I saw someone commenting on the beauty of sex scenes ... What? Absolutely. When this movie is bad, you can also turn it into a sensual porn, but instead I see some white dude who prevents me from seeing the Wuhrer body and the scenes that do not give me anything but a tease. They should have just gone to the cinema so the film would not be a waste of time entirely, but no. By writing this awful text, they should benefit from the appearance of Hierr, as he is the only supporter of the film. 2/10, just because it looked very hot.
