The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is not a good film in any way, but I can not really say it's a movie I'm sorry to see. I can continue to talk about the negative aspects of the film, such as the terrible representation and long scenes where Cage looks for the girl, hallucinations, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence - hallucinations, etc. . , But it is not worth detailing when it comes to a film like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should see The Wicker Man, although it is bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it has some really scary ideas, the only problem is the cunning, funny implementation Unintentionally. If there's nothing else, it's a movie that might inspire you to watch the original 1973 movie, or even read the short story it's based on. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheesy horror / suspense, it is very aesthetically pleasing. Obviously it was filmed on site instead of using a green screen or detailed collections, so we see some very wonderful views. There are also many shots composed well. It's a good-looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not as representative as a natural force. Whether you are a fan or not, it seems impossible to play Cage as a "normal man". There is always a kind of weirdness or strangeness that he brings to the characters he plays, and I personally am always proud to watch him in any film he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or bad, he always stimulates his unique energy and never tires of watching. It's terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student may write a paper for this film, which seems to be the most anti-women film. "We see?" You can write, "This is what happens when women are allowed to run a community!" The similarities between this "Summersisle" community and the colony of bees are very interesting and worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, it's possible that you've watched a YouTube video that has become very common: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, including Cage running in the bear's dress, and of course the infamous "Agha !! Bees !! My eyes!" Line. These scenes are fun out of context and are still somewhat funny while watching them in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I bought a blockbuster DVD for about $ 5 ... When you succeed, it's about a dollar for every reason. It's a good deal. <br /> <br /> Note: The best way to watch the uncorrected version of the movie is to watch the version just for its small addition to the finale, which includes a magnificent veil from James Franco.
