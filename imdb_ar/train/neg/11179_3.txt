As far as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. One propaganda breaks the courageous end of what once seemed to be a perfect and perfect career. Pacino plays his role as a non-artificial bed and attacks everyone with a completely false fill and an inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot pops up in this way with a lot of undesirable endings and probabilities that mind (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is present, does not do much. Their sights with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. It's hard to believe they mean much to each other. There is no power there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, lit the screen. She was electrified and her scenes with Pacino were the most interesting in the film, but she was not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
