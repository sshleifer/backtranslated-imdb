Incredibly bad representation, not a good story, unclear and glamorous images and slow movements where they are needed at least: adrenaline is all the film should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verban (a similar) Dutch soap actress who did not attend her English lessons) plays the role of the rich girl Freya, who usually has a "look for excitement". Which is mainly done by dangerous stunts, breaking things and disturbing people. Not in a fun Jacas way. Then there is Draco (Rivas). He is driving Kinda a bunch but he has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Locker), who also plays a dubious role. In the end, we got Jason (the beginner of Villal), a friend of Freya. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone appears to be involved, but we viewers do not really care as one of the actors either loved or loved, and the story has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Why did this happen? 10/02.
