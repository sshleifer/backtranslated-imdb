During the first 40 minutes, Empire was able to form itself: it appears to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster. At that time I did not know the reason, I thought it was good, but now I know it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems in this movie is that it is pure and complete. I do not mind movies that have a psychic and stuff, to prove the existence of Jackie Brown, for example, but they are all terribly shallow in this, but obviously this is being entertained. You literally feel the pull knot in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is arrogant, arrogant, and ironically, not so bad. He does not seem tight enough to be a killer drug woman. The truth is, at the end of the day, this movie is quite buzz. This enormous chaos must not be avoided at all costs, not smart, boring or meaningless. <br /> <br /> * From ***** (1 of 5)
