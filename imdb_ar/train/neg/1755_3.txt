This movie is not without magic and also shows a little warmth, but in the end this effort is very vain and focuses heavily on potential customers. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all the time displayed on the screen but it takes a lot of lights away from the rest of the actors. <br /> <br /> Another problem is overloading the script with a lot of clich√©s. The daughter who abandoned the college in secret, an old woman who finds it difficult to get a good job (and ends up with a somewhat humiliating performance), executive director of a flabby network with his executive games talking about substance, and a journalist who clears up nothing really wrong. None of these things, that is, they are all rooted in reality, but in combination, they are so many and leave us with a lot of surprises and little surprises.
