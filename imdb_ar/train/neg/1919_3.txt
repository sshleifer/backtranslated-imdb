I have read the book several times and this film does not follow exactly as it should. I was able to let this slide, after each film. However I have serious problems with the movie setting. No one seems to remember that this film and the book on it are based on real events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this film is supposed to be based. First of all, the "small" city that is being talked about as the setting, is the third largest city in the state. It has a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scene of the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the Platte River Valley. They are very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me feel crazy to see my hometown treated very badly. This was a real event. Large parts of the city were eliminated. They talk in the book about cycling from Mormon Island to Foner Park. I think you can if you do not mind riding 15 miles in each direction.
