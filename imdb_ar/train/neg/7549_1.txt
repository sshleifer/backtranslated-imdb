If Edward Woodward is the clicks that you see this movie, this is what will scream in horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but enough. We got Carter, the Italian job, two thousand and now this. What are the similarities? No, it is no coincidence that three out of the star Maurice McLuhet and other stars are another great British actor. The main element common to those originals is the versatility of films. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were strange English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that could not be copied in the USA. The word is worship and the best way to destroy a cult movie is to end it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> The Wicker 06 faced a difficult task before reaching the road. Wicker 73 is more ambiguous in the films of other sects mentioned. It challenges genre, smart scripts, class A actors, musical score, specific groups that defy descriptions and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> So here comes a new version. Do not worry no assets have been damaged in making this new version. There is a need to rephrase some of the main aspects of the story for the modern US - communications, pagan, virgins. But this is just a complete hypothesis. So we give the last policeman a full-fledged style shock with flashback music shock for cheap worries. Then with no mobile phone on the island sorter connection - but this will not happen in the real world. The policemen just do not get lost. Give it a bloody link to the motivation instead of a conflict of beliefs and you have a new copy. Thin chip though, right? <br /> <br /> She just put it all on with a shovel. The modifications to the name were simply a hammer, the process was almost curry-en, there was no sense of community on the island, there was no center of the city to pick up your bearings, only a few houses spread around a forest and that was the case. Willow was just annoying not to give any information at all, and Cage was useless to let her get away from her. When he went to the well you knew he would close it. The script is marked all the way to the end - you just want to speed up and end. The conclusion was completely joyful and we did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This ending is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends up in the most beautiful sunset after a terrible day. The other ends with a post-production conclusion that explains everything in the heavens. <br /> <br /> I liked the original version but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to watch the movie. I was left grateful to know that this film would probably end up under a highway somewhere this time just forgetting mercy forever.
