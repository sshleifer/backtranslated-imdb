I have to tell you straight away, I'm certainly not an authority in Bollywood movies and I've only seen a bunch. However, if you never see one, do not start with it! I enjoyed the people I saw so far, but I could not stand on it. I have to tell you in advance that I could not finish this movie - it was annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called 'Rambha' in the film. It's more annoying than Jar Jar's Binks - which I did not think was possible. It's also # @ ^! I spoke falsetto voice and I thought it was supposed to be a comic satisfaction. Instead, he spit on my nerves and wants him to die ... slowly! His voice, his behavior and his hatred - did not seem to be silent and controlled every scene he was in - and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The champions had an amazing ability to easily avoid AK-47 bullets. I was not because I was - there was a scene where a number of unarmed men armed a small army of men with these assault rifles !! Again and again, avoid taking one shot and hitting the Hashashin !!! This made Stallone's actions in Rambo II seem worldly !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was very loud, in your face and intense - which made my brain bleed practically! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE for music and motion, motion, motion ... This film is clearly designed for someone who can not take a movie with the plot and wants to make about 100%. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters, their actions and motives are meaningless ... nothing at all! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you are the most passionate and Bollywood lover, you can view this movie, but for me I can see why it is listed in the IMDb's famous 100 bottom list. Wow ... this movie is very bad and bad !!
