In some ways, the concept behind the story was a rather interesting mix of several types of feature films in an interesting mix. However, there was no meaning in this film so much so that it was not worth close-up footage. I felt as if I had been beaten on the head by the so-called mysterious interpretation of a disease that kills people. <br /> <br /> It appears that the writer lifted clichets from other films as an alternative to writing lines adapted to actual characters. Actors did not help things. No chemistry. I think they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if that was only for the reason that this is an essential element in these stories. However, the authors did not work hard to develop chemistry. Sure, both are attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other seems to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The character of Turner shows the persistence of Sabato, which evolved very quickly and for any specific reason. Sabato is supposed to be a respectable doctor and can not seem to play with the rules. Think of Jeff Gold Plum's character on Independence Day. Usually, this type of personality is supposed to show some kind of talent or intelligence. The character of Sabato does not. It is Cassandra who enjoys only madness and all the prophetic skills of the magic of eight balls. It seems to be right by random chance. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are comic. Each actor was really trying more than little to show the suffering they had suffered. The symptoms looked like bad mud, like this video from the 1980s, I think Peter Gabriel.
