I saw this recently and I must say, I was impressed by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a film did not quite work. However, I look forward to watching the documentary produced by the producers who organized this project because I think it will be a more convincing work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international film consists of B-actors in the class but their representation was appropriate, and I should mention in particular the young actress who played the role of Holly. This was her first film role, and she did a great job, considering her mind as the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was enough but cute like Patrick, the American who is trying to "rescue" Holly, but Chris Ben was good in this final. Unfortunately, in spite of my mostly supportive opinion of Virginie Ledwin and Udo Kier, each of these actors was a great loser and did not do their best in this film. <br /> <br /> I think in the film's letter and intention, but I have to be fair, so I classify "Holly" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a film. But I think the subject deserves serious consideration and I'm glad that the people behind this film have made a documentary film, and I hope to have a first appearance on the BBC and other television networks.
