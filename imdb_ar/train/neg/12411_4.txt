There were a lot of great horror movies that were produced in the 1970s - but this is definitely not one of them! It is shameful that a child is not the best because he works through a decent idea that takes on a few successful horror themes at times. We have an idea of ​​a child of revenge, he has succeeded in classic films like The Bad Seed and then we have the central Zombie theme, which was of course the backbone of many successful horror movies. The plot is basically: a little girl blames a lot of people for the death of her mother, so go to the cemetery and raise the dead to avenge (as you do). All this is good and good, but it's boring! Nothing happens to most of the film, and although it is not picked up in the end with something beautiful; it is not enough to justify sitting through what is left of it. Obviously the film was filmed on budget so the sites look cheap and all the actors are bullshit. There is not much I can say about the film in general where there is not much for it. The baby is a terrible flick in the seventies and I certainly do not recommend it.
