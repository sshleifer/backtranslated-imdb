Visually interesting, but located in the Department of Authenticity. This is a hard workout in the technique worn after the opening battle. Good Lou has a burning toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so bad that it continues to get you out of the movie and made me think of work, billing, my dog, etc. There are many moments that scream on the blue screen. Paltrow is as wooden as they get. This can be saved by dialogue Snar movie or Snappy camp top. My only complaint about this technique is that Black & White will be useful because it looks like Turner in black and white. Just a big vulgar mess. Best break the femur from sitting in this endurance test again.
