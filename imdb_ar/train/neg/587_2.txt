The film itself distinguishes itself from the documentary "The Wonders of the Human Body," about which the film revolves, courageously, albeit strangely, in choosing the disgusting excitement in the scenes. In one scene, the camera closes in a huge 50-foot space while a teenager presses and exits the pus. Elsewhere, the camera is soaked in a quagmire of half digested food and stomach acid as portions of noodle salad drops from the esophagus and drowns in the goo. In the final round of power, the camera takes the viewer on a horrific journey through a forest of ... Teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I do not do anything of this. Watch this movie if you should, but: bring your bag that does not contain vomiting, and you do not have noodle power pre-made.
