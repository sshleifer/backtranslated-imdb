I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my evaluation, but in this film there is not much to talk about. Just mash mash of other FAR best sword and magic lures. Lack of cohesion works as rampant as does vanity. Even the main jerseys that refuse to wear other clothes, the cloth is very boring because it holds a large box for a small boy. Moderate entertainment in the uncertainty at best and very late at worst. Lucio Fulci was canceled down the barrel here and shows it. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Posters & Stills Galleries; Lucio Folsi Pew and American and international drama trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani naked throughout Time (some may consider it so attractive, I did not); various add-ons are nude as well
