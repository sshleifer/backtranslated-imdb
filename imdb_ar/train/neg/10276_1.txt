So you may read some of the comments posted on this movie and maybe think of yourself, "Hey there was definitely a group of RAV REVIEWS published on December 30th." The funny thing is that most of these rave reviews look like coming from the same person or at best a small and coordinated group of "open house" groups. The truth, my friends, is that this film is really insurmountable. Just because it is "independent" does not mean that it gets a free entry permit. If you do a musical work, both in the film and on the stage, whether in Broadway or in the community theater, you must make sure that (a) your actors can sing, (b) your actors can dance, (c) have sound equipment, D) Your degree is well written, and (e) you have ingenious and charming words. Even Anthony Rap can not save this. It is one of those unfortunate experiences in the field of cinema, where I have already felt very embarrassed by all concerned.
