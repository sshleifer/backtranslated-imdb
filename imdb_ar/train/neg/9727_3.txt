One of my other films in the box deal, this film gave me exactly what I was expecting - a load of dreadful neglect complete with ladies who scream. <br /> <br /> Everything started well - I was impressed with the small introduction by a "news bulletin" about the two young couples who were exposed to a nuclear explosion, and were completely absorbed until the first person caught fire ... <br /> <br /> Since Then, the film descended into a strange frank, sometimes almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to be suffering from the same situation as the main character (the ability to light escape without the help of a match) it seemed as if someone threw the idea at the last minute ("That'll be good!" You can almost hear them say ...) As for the very psychological relationship between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The film came in cheaply - if you paid more than Â£ 1.50 for it.
