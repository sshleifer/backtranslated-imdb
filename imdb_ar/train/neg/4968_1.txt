I was expecting the film based on Grindel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but it was narrated from the perspective of the beast. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you think of Gardner's book, the film based on the Beowulf epic should not have the title of Grendel, when he says nothing more about the beast behind the few pathetic scenes in which the monster CG appears to be Nothing more than just a modified Predator game. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the book should also be punished because the original story has been deeply diluted and contributed to the continued growing ignorance of mass television audiences throughout the United States. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is typical to get this wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
