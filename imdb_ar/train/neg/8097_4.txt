He is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest producers of productions of all time (certainly the biggest stink of the career of director Brian de Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a boy rich in heaters and goes to pieces when he and his partner Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in jogging. His story tells another arrogant person, the reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and irony, but it certainly does not add much. It has been undermined by unimaginable, one-dimensional personalities who never want to dislike the encounter in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not complete it because I did not want it) but it's clear to me that those who benefited / did not enjoy the novel consider this movie a complete farce. <br /> <br /> I have never seen many talented actors striving to give a film less than average some of the quality and failure aspects. What a waste of it. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with a gentle man throwing Tom Hanks in a supposedly unsympathetic role. The role of Peter Fallow in the novel was the role of the British. Bruce Willis misbehaves. There was no thinking there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman can not escape the film with dignity intact, as he is forced to give a heavy lame lecture about "decency" after the peak. <br /> <br /> This film ends up turning into a ridiculous farce. <br /> <br /> I loved the talent pool. So I'll give it four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a much better film might be made from the source material.
