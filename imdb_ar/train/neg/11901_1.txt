"Land of a lot" is not a film. It is a trademark of the German director Wim Winders. <br /> <br /> Many have felt this in the "Million Dollar Hotel" and now the "land of plenty" is quite clear. Not only has Winders lost it, he has already become a BAD director, creating stories and scenes that are horribly terrible. <br /> <br /> One might argue that "the time you lose" comes to every outlet, but winders the extreme situation. It seems as if he completely forgets everything he knows about cinema and starts over again - just to get slow results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this movie is not worth your time.
