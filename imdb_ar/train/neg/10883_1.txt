This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it at a demonstration called "Fantasy Festival". I find it terrible because some scenes look like chaotic and dark music videos, and the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no doubt film. The music is totally out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the film looks interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is exciting but the development needs a complete review.
