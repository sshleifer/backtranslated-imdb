This movie has to be nominated for a new type: Complete Mess! Except for a few chuckles and one or two gore scenes, this movie is a complete waste of time. The name "Campy" does not cut. "Campi" means the fun that was not the film. The first half of the film says, "Better to get better, right?" In fairness, it happens, finally when finally explained who are the "brother / sister" team and what they want but by that time, no longer care anymore because you spend the entire second half of the film wondering exactly what Mr. Onorati and Mrs. Pacula did to mark a person What's so bad to be stuck in such a terrible movie. <br /> <br />
