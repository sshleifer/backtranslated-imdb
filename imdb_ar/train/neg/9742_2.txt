It is a rather boring film about a world that creates a remote transmitter and is terribly distorted when the device is used to transport itself. A simple plot to do before in flight and others. Not only is it distorted, it can also shock people with a touch. What really matters in this film is that we are expected to believe that the place where this person works is against him. He may have been able to make millions for the institution he works in, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleport at every step of the way. In the end, the projected man depicts three people for no reason, then he follows those who have sinned.
