If you do not know what will happen in this film in the first five minutes, then give it a few minutes. Lilia is a widow. I have been left on the shelf for a long time and want to explode. She has a teenage daughter that just stands out that she does not get any younger. While checking her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared ... the club, where she can dance in tight embroidered clothes while men give her money. The movie is very annoying. It depicts men bleak. Which is somewhat strange when you veer off nightly around for them, not for money, but only for hell. When she succeeds in arousing it, she feels like a woman again. She does not want to communicate with them but is addicted to attention. The other dancers are mostly older women who look like men in the clouds and realize that their time in the spotlight is short. Not short enough to say. She finds romance, however brief, you guessed it ... no surprises here we have not seen. Although the end is good, you only realize that it can not end any other way. Maybe this film is not targeting demographics - 30 male
