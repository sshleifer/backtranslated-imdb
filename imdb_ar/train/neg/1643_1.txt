"Shake" is one of the most horrific movies ever. It's a nasty piece of trash that made me force myself to stay in the theater more than any other film in 2000, in addition to "The Grinch." It is not, as people have described it, an insight into modern relations. It will be a small film called "high precision". While this film was honest and sympathetic, the "skin" is a cynical, mischievous cinematography. Avoid this like a lot of epidemics, unless you want to see how bad the "comedy" can get.
