The film begins with a couple from the camp and a man and a woman who are supposed to be together and walk alone in the vast wilderness. Surely the man hears something and quits it a lot in investigating it. Our killer greets him with a stab in the stomach. He then chases the girl and cuts her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the point of view of the killer. <br /> <br /> Then we meet our four main characters, a couple, one on the rocks. Men are flirting about the way women will never be able to deal with the camps on their own on a double date, leading to the aspiration of blonde token to leave a week ago. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car is torn apart ... and end up in the evening. When men arrive, they are warned of people who disappear in the forest by a crazy Ralph man. They ignore the warning and venture into the dark night and play a song in the eighties in the background with lyrics about killing in the dark woods. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, realize that this is not just a copy of the Burning game, but it's a ghost story! Women, afraid and lonely, gather in the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play Tom. Well, obviously they are ghosts by the way. Their mother shows blood from a hole in her forehead and asks the lady if they have seen her children, before they disappear of course. <br /> <br /> The children run to the house and tell him about two beautiful women beside the river. This causes a sensation and wakes up, holding a knife from the top of the fireplace. "The girl is going fishing," the little girl marveled. It is clear here that the father is not as ghostlike as his children. <br /> <br /> The symbolic blonde felt the evil sinister, as she fell blindly at night carrying a knife. She met the father who explained that he was starving and would be fast. This makes no sense because of the roar of the tiger we heard earlier (maybe he's allergic!) Are the leopards honest even in California? He ended up being slightly injured before he stabbed his head. A thunderstorm erupts and the men search for shelter, where it turns out that there is a place for a papa. It is clear that there is someone living here because there is a fire and something strange is going on over it. The children appear and warn of Baba, who appears moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For any reason, our murderer kills only females. He invites men to deal with something and tells us the story of his ex-wife. Our flashback gives him his wife falling cheating. But the old man does not tell them that he and her lover are killing her afterwards, but he dreams of it. We do not give cause of death of children. Men go to sleep and leave unharmed. The next morning the men discover the empty camp for their wives. After a brief discussion they split. The first is to stay in the camp, while the other goes and gets help. The person who returns to his car breaks his leg. Then we are reunited with the children and they explain to the surviving women that they are ghosts killing themselves from grief over their mother. They agreed to help women reunite with their friends. <br /> <br /> The following scene challenges the logic of the film when the man who is waiting at the camp site is killed. He was also dating or marries the blonde. In a way, the children realize that they killed and told the woman. She decides to see her herself and obviously attacks the killer. Fortunately, he makes the children stop by threatening to leave him forever. You know where this happens. <br /> <br /> In general, the film deserves four stars out of ten, and this is a generosity. Despite all her fears, the musical result is good. It's still very watch. There are some camera angles that look professional, some are good. The plot is incredible. There is something like a lack of readiness comment, but with a frog 6 miles away; I can not imagine that a symbolic blonde would take off like this in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "skipped" Bannacheck
