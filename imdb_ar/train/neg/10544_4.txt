When childhood memory tells you that this movie was scary; it's a touch and go whether you should reconsider it. In any case, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cold wreak by Jeff Cooper. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good film, it's sad to say. It is full of police cliches and a very bad text with holes from which the truck can leave (along with innumerable "twists" that help the story run). Lo Diamond Phillips is a bad ass cop who overly trusts and sends the serial killer of Paddy Cooper to the gas chamber only to discover that he was one of Satan's own lawyers and now has the power of the resurrection and the power of possessing every weak-minded person he comes across. Through this combination, my psychologist recognizes very weak and helps in the cause. <br /> <br /> Ah, this is trash. But enjoyable as such, especially if you have beautiful memories of it. She scared me as a child and this scene with a homeless person is still good. As for any kind of logic here, forget it, almost every scenario is thrown out, and you end up stifling between Stephen Segal's click and a satanic point in the 1970s. Who thought on the ground that the idea of ​​Le Diamond Phillips was in the lead here? Needless to say, it is not convincing at all, but it does its best and I have never had a problem with so many reviewers here. As for Trecy Griffith as a psychologist, say what he says the better. But Cooper is a good killer. I have always loved this actor. <br /> <br /> "First strength" may be just what the doctor asks after a hard day's work, and there is a need to "turn off the brain". Beer will probably improve the viewing experience and I'll certainly get a lot more of it the next time I give this movie a role. All in all; not a good flick but a rather gratifying pleasure for the nostalgic masses who were easily afraid as children. "I see you around, my friend!"
