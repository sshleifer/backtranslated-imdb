Before I start ... let me say that I believe in God completely. I believe in paradise and in hell. Kay Now that I have gone out of this way, I just want to say that what the world does in those who call themselves "hosts" think they are doing? The last time I reviewed it, adding, do not discriminate or broadcast hateful hatred on television, or try to remove their beliefs from every unfortunate soul venturing on the channel. Phillip Phelps, Pat Robertson, is the author of these fascinating novels of insanity, stupidity, conservatism and the Bible. I'm all for freedom of speech, but since when does that cover someone who says so much that if you venture into his ideal way of life, you're immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many problems SOOOO faces. One day in my classroom, we had an alternative teacher, so we decided to watch some TV because teaching did not give us any work. We saw (despite much of our will) a club of the 70s, and of course the tone was about shouting and raving about the Bible. "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I've already heard a child go, "They think it's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people believe that another person's sexual orientation is a big sin, they seriously need to take this host, their tube, and throw them out of a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
