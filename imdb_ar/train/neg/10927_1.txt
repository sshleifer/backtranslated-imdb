Reviews of this film were chilly at best while the expectations were high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a rather funny idea, and a major actress loved by everyone. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's supposed humor in the fantasy world fails in every way to entertain her audience (I did not hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation), passing through the thin storyline and one-dimensional characters without sparking one sign of the magic he wished for. 90 minutes of film here sterile stealthy direction and some good actors are doing their best to become a professional in the feature can not look great idea in the group, not to mention the paper. "L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay" is a collection of comics, linked with a thin layer (of good ideas). Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
