I know I voted one out of 10, but this is not really worth more than half a star. I hated that. I was stupid and very unrealistic, I can not believe any of the signatories to do this ridiculously ridiculous project. <br /> <br /> James Gee and Catherine O'Hara were excellent in their characters, Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story sucked and encouraged anyone who saw this in the video store not to bother picking it up and reading the back cover, but only For walking ... I do not even want to get to what the movie is about, because it is too stupid to be touched. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It is horrible! terrible!
