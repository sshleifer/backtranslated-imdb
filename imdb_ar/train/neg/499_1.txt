Horror plays only soft gothic porn movies every night from 10 pm to 4 am, but their "intimidation" factor is very limited, if any. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a lottery profit of millions of pounds to win more than anything the channel offers. <br /> <br /> The Bloodsucker Leads deserves a special dance dance because I feel, undisputed bottom of the whole channel of its lows. I can not even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but to complete the minimum of 10 lines that this site demands, I will give it at least. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to working on the screen. In fact, the film may also be called "toothbrush" or "wallpaper" for everything related to the scheme. At least they used the toothbrush ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no vampires for miles around them, and worse, there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were shooting two different movies by mistake here. <br /> <br /> The most appropriate title was "The Italian Count of Five Bringing Five People to a Scary Fort and Filling us Silly for 90 Minutes". Yes this fits better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the dubbing is horrible, and the man who plays Seymour was a woodman in his career as he was in his character .... deep. <br /> <br /> The only graces this film offers is a gay, but somewhat impressive, sexual scene that is very sexy and very sexy, and the added attractiveness of being separated from every female character. reward. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, direct a broad birth away from this generator. No vampires, no dance, no scenes of wild or ugly nature, no way on the land of the gods I will never see. <br /> <br /> There are no false words, this movie can put you off the moving pictures of life.
