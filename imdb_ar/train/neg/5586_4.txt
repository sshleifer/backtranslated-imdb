Man To Man tries to be a good film: he has his right heart in the right place, aspires to be an epic and has a message that everyone will appreciate. But there are also some problems in this picture. She strives to be good and communicate her message so that the viewer sometimes feels irresistible. So it is enough that the images used by this image are simplified - Man To Man Do not let the viewer decide what he thinks is true but beats his message in his head. Joseph Vinn embodies this in his role: he is doing his best to appear anxious, real moving and all the other feelings that you can express with one face offered by his repertoire. Add that the movie is connected and lose its speed near the end, it will easily take you to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend her: she is amusing, has some comic scenes and Christine Scott Thomas. Of course it should not be compared to human masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you will leave the theater satisfied. Try to grab your heart (even if your mind thinks it is very clear) and succeed most of the time.
