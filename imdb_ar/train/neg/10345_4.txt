By 1941, Columbia was a great full studio and could produce a film with the same Polish technique as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing to say about Adam Had For Four, the popular soap opera with almost horrifying performances by Ingrid Bergman (rated as Best American Movie) by Warner Baxter. Bergman plays the role of a French woman (this was the period in which Hollywood thought that a foreign accent was as good as others) was employed as a successor to the four Baxter children and continued to do so (with one interruption resulting from the collapse of the stock market in 1907) First World. Everyone in the film is very good, is it a relief that Susan Hayward when you enter the villain halfway? It revolves around the only person who can be seen in the film even though it directs Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh clearly. It is also the first in the long succession of alcoholic roles? But the scenario is still saccharine and the end is completely useless. No wonder Bergman's refusal to "Valley Resolution" was similarly planned, four years later.
