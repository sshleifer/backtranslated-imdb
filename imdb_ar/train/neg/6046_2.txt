This film is basically two hours of Davo character that drank himself - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you do not have enough clues or know the characters to be surprised. It was just a waste of time and grief. <br /> <br /> Willem Davao is an excellent actor. Peter Sturmar is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow do not make the movie bad, it was bad. The piece of earth blended with artistic dispersion is not drawn in detail by a distorted visual image in a coherent manner in a purposeful manner to plot except to highlight some of the pores that are evident from several perspectives, in the end. I truly appreciate the artistic vision, but as a hobby, I slept. (Seriously, I grew up and had to re-watch the movie - which was more frustrating.) <br /> <br /> I do not generally like to make negative comments or comments on others' work, even when sucking, but this film justifies one. It is very bad that these great representatives were ashamed of this final result.
