I was not sure how to evaluate this film, because it was so bad, it was actually very funny. I'm not a fan of Gackt in any way, although he is talented, despite the strange alias that looks like a cat coughing a hair ball. I always thought that Hyde was talented, but Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But the subject here is people. This movie is ridiculous. It's totally over and it makes no sense that it's like a parody of superhero movies. <br /> <br /> There is almost no movie here, except for the movie about vampires with gang friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, where there were a lot of ideas, which led to insufficient time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The scenes were laughable. The editing was fast, almost incomprehensible, with the choreography design that was very bad. Although Hyde seemed very elegant during the scenes of motion, this film is the only redemption. I sucked for good motion movies, but was done terribly. Although the final was fine and highlighted what the film is otherwise frustrating. <br /> <br /> Jumping between species is not a good thing. She wants to be a drama or a flick of work or a horror or a love story ... What the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you crazy, why? Is it because Gaket and Hyde are your love? Do not fool yourself, this movie is bad.
