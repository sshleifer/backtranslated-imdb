If you like watching Mel Gibson at Million Dollar Hotel, you may enjoy Burt Reynolds in another very bad film that can not be distributed. I can only witness a DVD version, so VHS may be better in quality but the night and dark scenes were so bad that everything seems to be red. I thought at first that my DVD players had been corrupted. Not so. If you insist on watching it, I advise you to set the color on your TV until it becomes black and white. If you do not, you will never be able to access the movie. If you do this, it will simply remind you of a bad film that students are trying to rethink.
