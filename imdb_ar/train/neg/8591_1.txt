I try to decide whether jumping in a wooden chopper would be more fun than this wreck. The destruction of what was previously a couple of classic films ends. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have Lucas career death. He wants us to swallow the Anakin Vader nonsense? I could not believe it was true. This film proves those feelings. The story has not worked since "Phantom Mooron", and every new film was crap so all the rest was a game show. I have to go. I know where some new rocks are to throw. Want spoilers? They have come. Luke and Leah are not associated. Vader is not their father. Duke Contao had to turn aside while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good for anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke in his first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother about his collection from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. The entire mess with Vedder and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she has any brains, she will not come within a light year of Annie, but she has been informed of what George Lucas has written about her. What a stimulant!
