What the hell happened here? !! I will not say this again but what kind of film is this backward? Dubbing in this much worse than dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy. It's about some villain named Dr.Who who gets followers to build a robot. Gorilla has the same power as King Kong but when it collapses this robot builds one another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (when Linda Miller is troublesome) Kong makes his slave but everything is fine and King Kong runs away and then sends Dr.Who the robot after him. <br /> <br /> Later when I was watching the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller started and the other clowns moaned. While I was playing, I hoped that the madness would end in the movie until the fight. The end must be very bad because they could show Kong back on an island fighting the dinosaurs again. <br /> You do not see the movie under any circumstances or if you ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
