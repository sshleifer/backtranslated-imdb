What a bad film. I'm really surprised because DeNiro and even Snipes will be tied to something like that. If you're making a baseball movie and showing scenes from a baseball game, at least make the movement look rather realistic. Why was the crowd always standing for no particular reason during games? *** Possible spoiler *** Another scene in the movie .... What was it? He led us in one way or another to believe that DeNiro found his way to the stadium in uniform, and even that the game was played in heavy rain .... one of the worst scenes ever in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10
