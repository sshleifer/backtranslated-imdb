Back to the cabin on the lake only .... it was missing. You must have a very low budget because you must shoot a fair amount of the film using a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you will have some quality camera-quality camera clips and simple video camera shots. Makes for a very strange mix! I think they should have found some ways to not influence the "home video" type! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you've seen the original CBTL because then you can compare the differences and see them. But if you do not see the original CBTL .... you will never want to see it if you see this first! It probably looks cowardly and even distracts you from your original interest.
