Martin Weiss, who directed the film "Rohenburg" steel, will be kidnapped with Wes Craven, for the shabby "The Hills Aiz II". The memory of the legendary original, which includes an incredible story and a dog suffering from flashback forever, will be erased through this technically glossy new release (by name only). A group of the National Guard (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills full of clumps. One by one soldiers are selected at the end of the week. This is. There is some hardcore violence and a somewhat brutal rape scene, but there is a little precious post to get excited about. The "heroes" of the film are the usual set of cliches and mutations, far from the original Kraven family, which is mostly like Brian Thompson from Cobra, along with some of the creatures left by Stan Winston in "Wrong Turn." A lot of events happen in the caves, "The Descent", and are well shot by Sam McCordy. One laughable aspect is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven to a sympathetic mutant roaming around his cave like Leizer Weissk in Hoover's original Saw. Weiss will be blamed for this blunder, but he is not really wrong because he is doing his best to keep the suspense and pressure on some of the maturity of the infamous positions. Not a fan, unfortunately.
