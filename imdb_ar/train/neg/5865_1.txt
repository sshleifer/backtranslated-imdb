I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few films I've ever tried. It was a bad assumption to start with, first male pregnant, but then tried to make it a parody. What were they deceiving all these real pregnant men ??? This was the worst film I've ever seen. If it has enough votes, it will be at the bottom of the IMDB 100 list. If it can be given zero, I will feel that I gave it a lot of credit.
