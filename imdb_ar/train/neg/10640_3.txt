From his uninspiring title to flat-screen presentations, Curdled is a great film. The film has gained some admirers through the fact that the name of Quentin Tarantino is linked to it, the silly gesture and out of place to Rodriguez / Tarantino flick "From Dusk to Dawn". However, these things do not make a wonderful film, and this is more evident through "coagulation". The film suffers from a clear lack of ideas, trying to disguise it with supposedly neat killings and events that are supposed to be disturbing. It is clear that the Mexican musical result that accompanies many sequences in the film to be cool, but it becomes annoying very quickly; especially apart from the fact that the leading character is Mexican, they do not fit the tone of the film. The plot is usually an anomaly and follows a Sunni dog, because of its obsession with horrific murder, taking over a company that cleans the scenes of murder. It seems boring and so is it. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin is the only "name" in the list of actors, so he does not leave an impression. He did not give anything he did in the film apart from talking to his victims and standing around him in an attempt to threaten, he wasted a lot. Angela Jones, or rather; Pulp Fiction taxi driver drives the role of a young woman obsessed with murder, and it is always clear that her involvement with Pulp Fiction earned her the role, not her acting ability. She may have been good enough in her little role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she does not have the talent to lead a film herself. Seems to be lost and non-existent for most of the film, and if it is not Latin, it will not convince the public that it is eccentric at any level. Curdled is a hundred percent piece of litter forgotten. Movies like this often win praise for invention or exotic black comedy; but this one fails at all levels. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino or admire William Baldwin or Horror Horror or just a movie fan; this is the one to miss.
