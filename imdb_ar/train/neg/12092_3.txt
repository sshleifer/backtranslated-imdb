I do not fail to recognize the skills of filmmaking in Haneke. For example, I appreciate staying on natural lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, with respect to the content of this film, I am very sad to see it in the 21st century there is still a desire to shape the relationships or feelings of hegemony over submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem faced by the main character with her mother is as unbelievably local as with Walter's alienation and incomprehension (I do not mean to frustrate a lover who does not like to return in the same way, and that's understandable; that means looking at her as if she were crazy, or If he was a monk, come on! " I mean, D / s is nothing new in the world, and I think it is absurd to treat the subject as something "strange" or satisfactory; it is not. In general, the films that deal with this subject really lag behind reality. <br /> <br /> So, to me, I feel that this film ends up being a completely programmable film, worried by old outdated political theories. This is almost embarrassing?), And this is not really linked to the real life and experiences of participants in development relationships (personal experience, forums, chat rooms, even modern scientific studies will explain this).
