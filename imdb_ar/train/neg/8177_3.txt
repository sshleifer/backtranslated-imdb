90 minutes from Mindy ... Mindy is teasing her boyfriend Bill ... Mindy shines in high school dance ... Mindy strolls to Big Sur, shopping in a loaf shop of "Pastry Shepherd," Mynde is almost raping ah, International. You should remember that these films were never designed to be viewed from start to finish on DVD players. They were created in a 90-minute atmosphere, so teenagers in the 1970's would get pictos and citations. It does not matter the lack of speed and structure for the original audience - it may only be set when the terms and conditions displayed on the screen match what was in the car park. The film is really annoying when you watch it as a story. It's fun talking about it more than watching it. My favorite madness: 1) accompanied by Bill and his teacher friend to find Mindy. With no luggage or changing underwear, they spend two nights sharing a motel room with a teacher, as in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and raped by almost corrupt cyclists, and after their innocent friend Ban is severely beaten, Mindy and her friend find an unmarked motorcycle on the road. Mindy shines instantly and chirps, "I'm going to Big Sur!" But again, talking / reading is more fun than sitting.
