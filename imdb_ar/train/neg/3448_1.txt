I checked this movie when he still had 6 votes and said that 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a terrible film. Lets break it. The first thing you notice about this film is that it was shot on a handheld digital camera owned by a student at a community college. The next thing you'll notice is that the actors, all of them student friends, said, "Maybe you met them in the bar the night before." Thirdly, you'll notice that editing is terrible, and they try to cram a lot of them into the movie in 30 intervals ... All digital edits are done on the home student's computer ... maybe using Windows Movie Maker ... it was horrible ... it was rude, it had an undeniable bad text, and I do not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I I judge the writer and the director to watch this film in Hell forever.
