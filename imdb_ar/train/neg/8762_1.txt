A scientist (John Carden - unfortunately) discovers how the dead bring back to life. However they return with marble faces. In the end, all this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> A boring stroll, quite predictable in the 1940s. This scared me silly when I was a kid but I filled me now. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, representation is terrible. Impressive boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Karadin, despite the script, actually gives very good performance. There are a few mildly creepy moments involving the great Dane ghost walking across the walls. There is also one of the worst knockout ways in movie history. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this. Avoid.
