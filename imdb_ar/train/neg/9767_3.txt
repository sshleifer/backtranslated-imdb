I think if you're in the sixties, I have to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching the wreck of a train barely visible. The graces of saving for this stranger include astonishingly social commentary on the values ​​of the 1960s and a number of relatively well-known actors captured in early (embarrassing) footage. It seems as though the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full-length film, covering all the highlights (and more) of the issues between the children of Venus and the institution, and then putting them in the hands of a hippie couple and giving them about $ 10,000 to complete. Barely classic, but in his own way obsesses over the real strangeness of the time, the absurdity, the over-idealism, and the enormity of the enterprise. Clearly not for everyone.
