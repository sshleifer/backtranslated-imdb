As the film begins, the narrator warns us that the scream of the skull is terrifying and may die of terror - and if so, free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone has died because of fear of seeing this movie, but some have died of boredom. Screaming Skull is a kind of film that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, Julie's story revolves around a rich but nervous woman who marries a wicked man who marries his first wife. He died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his home, tortured by a gardener half a gardener, a poorly executed image, and Tauos, and finally a skull circling the room and causing her screaming a lot. To her best, actress Biggie Weber screams well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the most important point in the film. The plot is very transparent, at the very least, and although the cast is actually fine, the script is very bad and the film is very uninspiring, so be prepared to run yelling at yourself. True, the thing lasts only about sixty-eight minutes, but everything feels it longer. Add to that the print quality is really awesome there. <br /> <br /> There are very bad movies to enjoy watching. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few of my Awami - but the film goes on so much I could not do more than giggle at times, and by the time everything will end up on your head from Ennui. If this is not the case for Peggy Webber with screaming, it will be a sure cure for insomnia. Give it a miss. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Raj
