Chances are if you see this again, you have a physical illness, and the film is very annoying ..... unless you believe in sececiennes, incarnation, and the other focus that promotes a great deal of time. "Recycle souls," they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been made several times before with films such as "Heaven Can Wait". It has also been done much better. Too bad, they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Sibble Sheppard, Ryan O'Neill, and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least, it's a very beautiful film, linguistically speaking. This is about the quality of replacing this movie only.
