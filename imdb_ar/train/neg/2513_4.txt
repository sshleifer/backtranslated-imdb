When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children section - it's very fun and sometimes humorous, and it's actually a very good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" represented by actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins To submit. I should point out that Walter Matthau is perfect by Albert Einstein, and his performance is wonderful, but this is the only exception. This movie seems a little disturbed, the director lacks substance, and oh ... the music is very bad and did not put me in a very good mood. But if you do not expect a good-looking comic / craft story, it is sure that this can be amusing, as I said .. You must be in the children section. Einstein and his colleagues are relieved by Tim Robbins' almost tedious and effortless attempt to steal Meg Ryan's heart. Film is very inconsistent, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be a good film.
