1914 was a wonderful year for Charlie Chaplin. He was his first film year and appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him an opportunity to slowly develop his screen personality. However, through this film, the character of "Little Trump" familiar was still under development. Charlie seemed sure part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and fitness he later developed. Instead, he often hit Chaplin or kicked or did other bad things for people without a reason at all. <br /> <br /> As for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch the movie. Although they are not familiar today, Chaplin plays starring with Maple Normand, Chester Conkelin and Mac Swain - all of them exceptionally famous stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that, although it contains a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Campbell arrived at the racetrack (a very common theme in Keystone productions - must be located near the racetrack). Charlie and Mac appear and infiltrate. Mac was chased by the police to do so while Charlie slaps Chester and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the police took Chester and Mac away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, strangely, did not show the expensive Charlie's behavior). <br /> <br /> Unless you're a huge silent comedy film or film historian, it's a very important forgotten film in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and other actors are actually doing on stage, though not usual for Keystone, is not particularly funny when watching it today.
