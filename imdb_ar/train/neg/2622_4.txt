102 Cruel de Vil (Close) believes that he will cure the treatment and release him to start a new beginning in life. Things go well for Cruella, who is busy with the help of homeless dogs outside the street. When Big Ben is hit, things get bad. The hypnotherapy is reversed and Cruella returns, this time designed to make this raincoat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glen Claus returns her role as Cruella de Vil and again features a movie. Every scene deserves to be watched in this boring film, which feels more repetition of the previous film, not a new story. <br /> <br /> It has changed. ?? Ken Shepherd (Iwan Grover)
