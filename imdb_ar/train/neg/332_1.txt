I will start by saying that I can not reach that. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there was no way to regret buying. Were you wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved the project? They must be forced to watch this movie again and again until the end of eternity. This is the only appropriate punishment I can think of to do something so bad. The shooting reminds me of the films I used to produce for classroom projects on a large old VHS camera. Acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few soft embossing. Yai, who cares ... Shecky Moskovich Uncommon, Comedian ships is the biggest loser. It's a lot of conspiracy as I understand. <br /> <br /> In general, it's the worst film I have ever seen. I own it on a DVD and gave it to many co-workers to watch. "Wow, I did not think I'd say I closed a movie of Adam Sandler after 15 minutes ..." <br /> <br /> I always replied "Well you can now" <br /> <br />
