Therefore, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American pie pie in the series. Although it has nothing to do with the original three American Pie films, some characters are supposed to be associated with the characters in an original trio and Eugene Levy is there (can not he get the best?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to complete this movie. There are no funny jokes. Representation is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "Southern" accent that looks more like a Canadian person's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be hilarious using the word "ya'll". This film makes me feel like a fool. Why do not I apply to a college where no one goes (but everyone gets good grades), girls are constantly wearing their clothes in public places, and everyone is practicing unprotected sex without the burden of children and sexually transmitted diseases. Thinking? Really, I have reduced this chain itself to pornographic standards of sensuality. Maybe in the next stage, they will break down recently and employ Ron Jeremy in the lead. I'm sure they can only link them to the series by removing Stifler's 3rd uncle once or something like that.
