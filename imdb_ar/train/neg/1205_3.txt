What is that? The Canadian zombie flick has never been heard before. The dead man works on the body of a young man who recently died. This allows to expand the flashback range that shows how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to the graveyard on Friday 13th and set up the dead thanks to his silly cheers. Return to the morgue where our dead body returns to life and kills the culprit and the owner (who floats in his eyes). WTF final? Shot homeowner has a funeral in a straight jacket and screams, "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, he has backpacks. <br /> <br /> He ran for 58 minutes, and this is certainly a strange thing in zombie cinema. It was a much longer feeling, but put me in a coma where I could not stop watching. The film also contains one of the "If you see this picture, stay away from the screen." It is the image of an old man who gets sick in the stage (the prophet?) And when he emerges (only twice) begins the flow of blood. Beautiful scenes damn beautiful for a while. There is a great passion where the zombie cuts off the girl's right hand with a shovel, but when the fake hand is drawn to the frame to chew her voice, it is his left hand.
