I can watch a great film every now and then. I've seen some very sick things. However, this is one of the few films that I found to be ugly in a way that was disgusting and disgusting. I love Gore movies when they are fun. Wen loved to have many of the creativity behind them. Al Gore in this film is not creative. That he was sick. It's disgusting. It's totally unpleasant. For this reason, this film is certainly not amusing. The film is a horror film, but lacks fear. The only reason why you watch this movie is largely why it is, but this is the most attractive and ugly aspect of the entire movie, and that says a lot. Representation is terrible, the plot is meaningless, the music is really annoying, as is the electronic sounding too. All this took me straight out of the film. Pretty much the whole film is one long frustrating long plight. There is this man who has a strange accident in a shuttle and wakes up in hospital to find that his skin melts and melts. I think then he goes out and eats the human flesh in order to slow the melting process. There are some alien subterfuge involving the pursuit of an old couple by a dog, a lumpy head floats down a waterway, and the end involves a man subjected to electroplating. There were times when I tried hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was fun was the early scene where a nurse was passing through a hospital corridor in a slow motion. If you like the ugly, ugly and unattractive horror movies, this movie suits you.
