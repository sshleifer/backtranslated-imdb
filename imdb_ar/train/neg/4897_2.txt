This film comes as a last disappointment in Tsai Ming Liang. It breaks the laziness of every frame. So I will not analyze them too well. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the hypothesis is drought, why see the city's scenery with flowering green trees? I wonder if this should mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (where thirst is a passion for intimacy, a poor alternative watermelon and sex). Or it's just a matter of making poor movies, not giving an idea of ​​being cohesive. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not know what happened to the porn actress, and why she is unconscious or, apparently, dead. It seems to be of no importance as long as the letter of supreme alienation has been successfully delivered (= tragic), but in the past, its passive body proves to be a cheap, With the same degree of exploitation and exploitation as the activity in which it is used. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing expressed in this film Anthony did not express his best 40 years ago? Without unduly humiliating his representatives. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from the "hole") felt like secondary schools' idea of ​​artistic confrontation, which was carried out at the very high school level. If this is the point, suck the point.
