I've heard about this movie a while ago and a friend recently got a DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we heard that this film was terrifying, really scary. How was I disappointed? Very !!!! Apart from this one scene (we all know nothing) nothing happened !!! I expected to see the woman in black several times and to see more fast scenes, such as appearing in the window, walking through the hall or anything. <br /> <br /> Almost all the ratings here say what a scary, gripping movie, this is the atmosphere. I just have not seen that I'm afraid. There may be a difference in what people find frightening in the United States here in Britain. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the distorted revisions :(
