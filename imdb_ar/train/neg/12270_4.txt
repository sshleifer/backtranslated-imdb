This stealth movie from Kiyoshi Kurosawa is a very beautiful film, and he had at least one panic scare I was amazed. But all in all, the film is incredibly stupid, as one detective tries to track down a suspected serial killer, only to see that he may have committed an offense. Then he finds himself haunted by the ghost of a wonderful Asian lady, and has no idea why (and not the viewer). With other homicides, it becomes more puzzling when killers are found easily, and this ghost still stalks him for some reason. Not only is this plot completely stupid, but the lady's ghost is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly flies around the city, like Wonder Woman. The result is meaningless, in fact, the entire film is meaningless, and I can not recommend it at all. If you do not take herself seriously, I think it was supposed to be a black comedy. Outside the "Bright Future", this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that I have seen so far.
