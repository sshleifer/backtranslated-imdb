Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to get started. The last film was a modest effort. Put it next to this burden, it's a classic comedy. While the second part was full of a lot of humor and dated cheap footage, at least it was funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. The jokes and quirks and jokes are supposed to be funny. Hitting the scenes above the head with tired jokes is not great. The humor in this film was to meet the needs of those who would laugh at anything. When they sponsored the high school audience, no sense of self-respect was thrown out of the window. Episode spoof is not funny. I've seen them in comedy movies since 1998. It's very dated. Michael Jackson jokes are not too cool. What is even worse is the irony of two thinkers who were the "performers" who were their best days ever. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema was slow. Such films are nails that are bombarded in their coffin. Whatever happens to true humor? I have not laughed loudly in a movie theater for a long time. Too many bad movies lead to brain damage. Want a guide? Go to the local video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is incredibly bad noise. Best Watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop instead of suffering through this bad excuse for comedy again! <br /> <br /> Certainly not recommended (unless you have a bunch of brain cells).
