This is supposed to be a comedy but its taste is basically bad, and nothing remotely causes a smile in the film. The film revolves around a couple trying to have a child, and those real-life people who are in this situation will be horrified at the pictures being filmed. For example, the scenes at the fertility clinic are no less funny and are frankly embarrassing. The male bullet, who plays the role of a construction worker and in his tough hat, is seen as a bad excuse for the villagers' refusal. The female tries to look younger than 20 years. Both benefactors come as unattractive, unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are many silly and completely unclear scenes in the film, for example with an economical airline, free of any humor. The only reason I gave this to 3/10 instead of 1/10 is the one mark for Shirley McLean, a category higher than anything else in the pic, and a single mark of some half decent music (though old).
