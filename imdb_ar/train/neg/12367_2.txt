Looney Tunes ventured (at least) twice in the future. The first time with Dodgers Duck was brilliantly funny. Was the last time with this? Mother ?? Effort. "Unleash Madness" is not without merit, and can be considered a good product for the quality of Warner Brothers. WB humor comics, which attract adults at least as attractive to children, are noted. On the other hand, these superhero rings can not convince the adults to move them. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis of this series is that 6 ordinary people (Arnaban, Tasmanian demon, duck, Rod Runner, and Wolf) live on the "City Planet" of Acmetropolis and gain superpower when the meteorite hits the planet in 2772. What is It is confusing that the address section features these individuals with counting up to 2772 from the 21st century. Cute, but stupid waving. <br /> <br /> In each episode, super sextet? Amidst amusing amusing but casual joke? Fight the various super villains. For the most part, these are the species that appear in every series of superhero adventures and even some of the best ones. Like many of the Medieval Champions series, this one takes the bad guys very seriously to the context. Of course these guys are the only characters that laugh ?? The usual villain laugh, of course. Why is it that the bad guys in the miraculous adventures are always predictable? Always ?? Evil laugh at every opportunity? It seems that the moving material of this kind leaves laughter exclusively in the province of the wicked and (sometimes) followers and / or followers. <br /> <br /> In fact, the makers of this series have missed their best bets straight from getting to go. The great powers of the characters sometimes depend on their former natural abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough of the World Bank madness. Lexi and Ace possess relatively ordinary bio-energy weapons and have no character traits that one might call "bug-like." What we have here is basically the "silly and mysterious" Titans, including its "hyper" modern "animation", but with animals. Feh. <br /> <br /> The other mistake made by the creators of the program is (or are) the bad guys. As noted before, this is not terribly fantastical and does an excessively wicked laugh. Surprisingly, writers have completely missed the obvious technique of making bad guys from WB characters as well as heroes. Add to the fun can be, for example, Jupiter Jupiter? As well as Fudd, still hunting wolves ?? As well as the transformation of E. E. the really wicked villain wolf? Etc. and so on. Ah, the grief of lost opportunities ??. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this production has gone into full overtime (ie, season 2). However, we can rejoice that there is something new to the continuous crowd of 14 teams. The rest of us can hope for a third season of Duck Dodgers.
