Currently, this movie is listed on the IMDb as the worst 42 movie ever - and that's why I hired it from NetFlix. However, it saddens me to recall that the film, despite its misfortune, is not a place bad enough to honor it as being among the top 100 films ever. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this film. Is hardly a glowing endorsement, but has not met the expected level of atrocity to be included in this heinous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stuart Moss and Marianne McEndro on her late honeymoon (by the way), she is married in real life as well). He is a batsman who insists on going to a nearby cave. Once there, they act very stupid (the hallmark of a bad movie) and are soon bitten by bats. According to this movie, the bat likes to attack people and there are vampire bats in the United States - both are not true at all. <br /> <br /> It is strange that after being bitten, the man did not bother to go to the hospital !! The first thing that goes into the mind of anyone (especially the doctor) is to get medical help right away, but not that boob. Soon, suffering from fits - but still not interested in asking for help! Again and again, you keep thinking that this must be the dumbest couple in the history of the movie !! <br /> <br /> After a while, he finally goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But by that time, it was too late and his attacks were more violent and he started killing people to suck their blood. When it is obvious to all that a man is a crazy killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for the mind) refuses to believe he is dangerous - even after he attacks people and steals an ambulance and runs a car. Police car on the road !! <br /> <br /> Now most of the time Moss passes these rings, his eyes fall back and he seems to be an ordinary person. But oddly enough that he sometimes develops his hands like bats and in the end use some beautiful artificial limbs to make him look like a bat perfectly. If this was really cowardly, the film would be worth 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a twist that hardly made any sense at all, the wife turned into a madly insane batwoman. A swarm of bats kills evil sheriff. How it was all arranged was a mystery as Moss and MacAndrew thought that this film would help them somehow in their careers - although both had reasonably long careers in television roles since 1974. <br /> <br /> In general, very stupid. The plot is silly and meaningless and is highly dependent on people who act in a way so stupid that they are not real. Not a good film at all, but not among the worst movies of all time as well. <br /> <br /> Note: For some reason, IMDb displays the charts for the three DVDs dedicated to IT'S ALIVE and they follow the THE BAT PEOPLE web page. Although the BAT PEOPLE was seen as "It's Alive", the two films are not connected. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since both came out in 1974, but the film I just reviewed was starring Stuart Moss and Marian McEndrew and the other film starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
