I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit, they were not a cup of tea. Although it is supposed to be a horror film of its kind. But while I was watching this, I was thinking, 'This film has no meaning at all.' Where did this man come from in a dark coat on the ground? Where were the two men going when they left the girls? Where did a shark come out of the ground? <br /> <br /> You have not added all of these elements in this movie in one way or another. It felt as if those filmmakers had wasted a lot of time and money in a film that was bound to be crap. <br /> <br /> I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst spells I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I told myself I would not see it again .. I had a lot of poppies in it, I decided to give it a thumb! Count me in this one! 0 out of 10!
