The latest rumors about this is that Vh1 started receiving calls for I Love New York 3 mid-2008. Does this mean that Budah or Tailor made New York or did that mean that New York had canceled the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love will come to season three, so now with Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... will there be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that the opportunity will be returned to the third season of I Love New York !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York will appear particularly on Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this was not much spoiler for the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just mentioning the latest rumor.
