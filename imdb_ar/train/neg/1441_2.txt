I took this movie on the cover alone to think that I was in an adventure at the Indiana Jones and Death Temple level. Unfortunately you are in virtual yawning. Not like any yawn I had before though. This yawning was so great that I hardly found anything of quality in this film. Description The cover has amazing special effects. There was nothing. The film was so light that the stereotypes were filmed horribly. It gives you the idea that you can solve the problems of violence. Good if you want to teach your children that. I do not. Stay away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment, you may find something more inspiring elsewhere.
