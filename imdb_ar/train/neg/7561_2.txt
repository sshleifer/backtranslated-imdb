Anyone who does not know the original 1973 British "The Wicker Man" will undoubtedly leave the cinema with a "weak impression" and "Peurile". <br /> <br /> As a lover of origin I left with the impression of Burley Bowers. <br /> <br /> From the bitter reality of bargaining between relatives who bring the power of law and order to a network of pagan barbaric rites on a remote Scottish island, called "Summersel" (origin) to a colony near Amazon-ic off the coast of the state Maine in the United States, called Summersisle, that the new version is barely reaching the place. <br /> <br /> This is, unfortunately, a case of what "was" possible to be a classic remake of classic being tampered with to meet the needs of the simple public. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the redrafted context of the film) the ladies concerned ... hang your head in shame.
