Why are you interested in watching this movie, if you have great movies to watch. It is a complete waste of time and money. The film was so bad that I felt uncomfortable because I wanted to see it. Everything is bad. The actors were bad. The script was very bad. The story is stupid. The worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film at the club. One interesting thing is that there is a fee that we wish to die because it is so stupid that we get it enough. /> <br /> Note: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-Stars out of 10
