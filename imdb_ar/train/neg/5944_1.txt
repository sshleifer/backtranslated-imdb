Not exactly my type, this kind of direct fighting on a DVD is the procedure I faced only because a friend put it in while we had a few beers. I am relatively open minded and I am very impressed by Eamonn Walker, so I sat on the stand to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and bones are the story of Isiah Bone, a former person turning into a street. The fighter for unclear reasons unfolds eventually with the progress of the film. Blah Blah Blah. <br /> <br /> What a hard movie. I understand that such films do not depend very much on the plot, but should they work in such an absurd and utterly unpredictable story? It may not be that important, but through the icy gums it bothers me. It is better not to have a pure plot and actions from the fleabag-filled mill full of novels. It is full of unfounded emotional wheels that can not be achieved at all - the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten interiors. Maybe at this point I should mention what, of course, is the point of drawing the film: fighting. Even in itself, the fighting is fairly poor. Bone manages to take out hardcore street fighters straddled in individual punches (a great culmination or two of the filmmakers' attempts to correct this contradiction); fighters who never conclude that one attack after another is a foolish trick. Even this repetition and stupidity, broken arms and faces with a constant sensitivity we see again and again. <br /> <br /> A set of motion picture films revolving around a grinder and worthy of direct access to a DVD, does nothing new and everything we've seen over and over again. Not very well.
