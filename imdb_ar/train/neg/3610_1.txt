One patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his bodyguards and then a university professor after going to the local college. The next semester, the replacement of the late professor and a new group of students have to deal with a new set of killings. Clich√© dialogue, hard to believe I was able to predict the lines in quotations. This is one of those cheap films that were assembled together in the mid-1980s. Although the heroine was killed off, this is just a substandard scrap. Terrible acting, horrible script, terrible effects, awesome horrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just a way to put it into a VCR when you do not have something better to do, although I suggest watching a bar clean your head, it would be more entertaining. Skip it and hire "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> R is rated for strong graphic violence, profanity, short nudity, and sexual attitudes.
