The rift in "Gremlins," which was a hit in 1984, may have been the biggest train wreck of a film ever produced. Even for "B", all the other cheap horror films on the same platform dwarf this film perfectly in terms of plot, acting and good. <br /> <br /> It starts with a random old guard and a younger security guard who is not important. why? Due to a few minutes in the film, he entered the Treasury "banned" and was killed while living his imagination for being a rock star in a cheap bar. <br /> <br /> These are just entrees for the main course food served. The main character, Kevin, struggled several times to prove that it was more than just a full pussy. He may succeed in the film, but the audience proves he is no more than a bad actor. Kevin gets a job with the old security guard and is guided through his security transformation in (so wait) abandoned studio lot. Yes why cost yourself the trouble of putting a set when you can just use the same studio. Return to the movie. Kevin opens one way or another safe taboo Hobboblins is released. Hobgoblins forces people to live with their wild fantasies and then kill them for some reason. Must be returned before sunrise or otherwise ... otherwise what? exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Kevin, a friend of the Kivu army, Nick, a "woman" Nick, Daphne who does not enjoy her character with greater content than the position of a slut bitch and a worthy whore fashion. There is Kevin's manipulative girlfriend and reserved "Amy", which seems to be her deepest desire to be a "Cher" image very much like a fishnet stockings with a pair of blue novelty pants on top .. Do not ask me how it works. It's very likely that the most fun character at all is KYLE. How these groups of friends are configured is up to the question. Kyle is an oblique creep who can not go for an hour without self-stimulation. His hobbies include calling up sexual chat lines from other people's homes and probably inhaling underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as the heroes search for Hobgoblins: high-knee creatures (also known as hand puppets). For some reason, try not to exceed the boundaries of the local neighborhood. Each character ultimately lives in the most luxurious imagination that has nothing to do with millions of dollars ... or for a big budget film. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers before: distortion at the end of this movie will leave the observer wondering "What?". Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by ... their free will. They may have lost patience waiting for the sunrise to subvert the chaos, or the storytellers may have jostled the author and decided not to worry about the end. When returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "what he learned in the army" and detonates explosives that destroy the safe, indicating the end of evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster flight; better suited for riding on a moving ladder. <br /> <br /> This movie is too bad to send someone to cry. If you plan to watch it, recommend some alcoholic beverages in advance to take any serious consideration of the film into account.
