Obviously, anyone who gives this film a good assessment has to do with creating it. This movie is a painful suckfest. Strong representation, the general soundtrack of the shares laughable, the trend is gentle, the strangest of all, the teacher is not really more attractive (making the student's progress more blatant embarrassment). The creative minds behind this garbage should be dismantled and spread to prevent the emergence of more such concentrated possibilities. I am sure that some of the starving children in Africa could have used the money that was wasted on this project. Hell, the money would see a more enlightened purpose feeding a crack addict; at least someone would get some entertainment from it. For the sole reason that he did not suffer from a terminal illness, I will present this film to two.
