Amazing order. So, after reading the little runner here, I decided to see this film myself. This movie is awesome. I stopped watching it. I highly recommend cleaning a cupboard instead of watching this movie, it will be more fearful / entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget with bad behavior. <br /> <br /> Everyone who gives this 10s movie is completely incorrect and must be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am not in touch with any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply, this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad film.
