I argued with myself whether to rent this or not. I am always afraid of renting something I have never heard of before (do not remember this in the theaters). Gorgeous cast ... This is what scales tend to. In 30 minutes, I stopped watching it. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but incredible. It gets worse after that. The book in this film can do some research on future projects if they want to make their films a little better. Or they can just try to write something a little believable. I give it 3 .... a 1 for writing (just because there are lyrics) and 2 in order to get a lot of good actors to agree to do this movie despite the need to read the script. Oh my God suck this movie.
