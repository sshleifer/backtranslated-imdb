It was a wonderful silent film. Really good disposition, at least in Ma look, I do a really great job! Kind of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. Each line is PROFFUND! Every scene is thrown by the tragedy of man! <br /> <br /> Mostly, I felt like I was laughing. However, like any train wreck, I could not tear my eyes. This dialogue may have worked on stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, random, penetrating, and every other typical negativity, you come out to describe a really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy melodrama in huge doses, accumulate, you * ll enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. Despite all this melodrama, this thing is sure to escalate. <br /> <br /> This text should not seem very different when the actors concerned read it themselves. It simply does not work as soon as they go to hand it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB often causes us great harm when we use the "weighted result" that is controlled by the computer. Curve of the Starving Class is worth less than 1. <br /> <br /> The characters' imagination is fantastic, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops without any reasonable explanation for their maturity or evolution, they are not. character development! You must have motivation characters. To be drunk for a while and wake up in a field * not * personal development. This plot plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least, watch it silent. You'll probably get some fun from all the characters waving her arm. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a word for the wise - to prove that this is a truly artistic film, James Woods sees in all his angry saying "Look at me, metaphor - and literal - acting - of - bare - weak man". <br /> <br /> No less be not warned.
