After reading all the rave reviews about this movie a few give it to it. I finally decided to throw out its value. I agree with most people about the point that if you were not Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Ohio Mariette. To the north of Debache where all the real talent ran south down I-77, at least as far as the gas tank allowed. I've got a chuckle from reviewers who skillfully claim that they brain a little better than most by pretending they followed the plot without being confused. This story by Wei Brothers Crock is an old record with skipping it. As an American, I understand the difficulties artists face in making films. A trip to Romania could wipe out the budget for sure. Let's face it, this entire film was an episode of Clare at the gas station, Claire on the roadside, Clare under the ovaries, Clare at home, Clare in the cornfield, and Clare at school. Clare is here and Claire is there. She almost became monotonous and would be if she were not the best actor in the acting team. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but do not write two-page text and turn it into an hour and a half. Before writing another script about ghost dreams, watch one or two episodes of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All actors except the above and two others participated in their first and last film. Also, there is the appearance of co-director Jeff as in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film has gone for is that the cameraman apparently has a fix on Loren Luis Derier. Well, with all the irony you're feeling now, I still recommend the horror movie just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (I hope) and Chris Ferry has proved himself a villain to watch.
