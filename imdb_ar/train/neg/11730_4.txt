Investigative reporter Darin McGovern (on behalf of Karl Kolchak), this time, returned after "The Night Strangler". Again, either police officials and fellow journalists oppose or want to cover up the supernatural angle. Director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story he gave to the previous night, with less understandable success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis brings together an interesting support team, including Dark Shadows graduates George Desenzou and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) heads an exciting group of oriental dancers. Although I have never seen her anywhere before, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGaven's companion to eat in an early scene, pretending not to believe in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
