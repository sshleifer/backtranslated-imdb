I really wanted to love the pillow book. An interesting story, the outlines of the interesting characters, Iwan McGregor in a completely glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenway became very excited to present the film in a unique way and not in favor of the film. I will not go into the bad representation of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> The story will be distracted by 4 billion small windows and the line at the bottom of the screen to display the lyrics of the music being played. He seems to have missed the real story submission and plot development, and get involved with faux fu decoration that has nothing to do with anything. A bit like the rendering of a picture of John Singer Sargent under Holmark Chintzy says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" With bright big letters. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was a victim of the director I was rather than what could have been - ridiculously beautiful and frightening. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In the hands of Greenway, it is better to come down to the fine art classes that take themselves very seriously.
