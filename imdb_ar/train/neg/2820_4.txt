I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not have bothered him. As another commenting male, there is not enough horror or erotica to bring fans of any kind. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are unjustified, and most other behaviors are not. Englund was doing his best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling had a really cool bottom, but that was not enough. This one is more tape. Grade: F
