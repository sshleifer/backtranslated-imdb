I went to see this film based on a review by Siskel and Ebert. I was not only cheated, I took some friends, and I had to spend the rest of the day apologizing profusely to make them sit in this useless nonsense. After that, I never went to see a movie that relied solely on the advice of Siskel & Ebert.
