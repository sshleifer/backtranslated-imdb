This presentation is painful to see ... <br /> <br /> Obviously, creators have no idea what to do with this show, from constantly changing "jobs", friends, and actors. They seem to have wanted to throw Amanda Baines into something ... but they had no idea what, and they came to this crazy show. They threw them in their teens, surrounded by twenty-three things, and put them in most adult cases in failed attempts repeatedly in the comedy. She quickly realized she needed a "clique" and received people in their late twenties to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How I survived this show of 4 seasons is beyond me. One way or another, ABC now decided it was a "family" program, and gave it an afternoon on ABC Family.
