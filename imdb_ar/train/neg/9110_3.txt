I watched this movie at three in the morning, a time of day where I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it was not good, it was not a good film at all. The reasons behind many. <br /> <br /> The acting is not very good, and I was reminded of the situations in which a comedy film Chevy Chase took place in the 1990s. I mean, come on, like putting cuffs, poker position between the servants ... It was clear that this movie was largely based on the first, that is OK. But if I had not seen the first one before I saw it, it would have been more absorbed. Like the end, came suddenly, I felt I had not closed anything at all ... Sebastien suddenly changed, and this movie looks like it was just made to explain the number 1, and there was no time or effort used to make anything else good. The result is the same as in the first order, and it did not feel like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They were supposed to deal with the situations more elegantly and class, but they did not, and thus, turned this movie bad ...
