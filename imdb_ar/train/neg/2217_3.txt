As the Russian world says two-thirds of the way to the film, "I have come to know." This sums up to a large extent the reason why I watch this movie - anything that involves a shark half a hammer head is certainly worth a serious empirical investigation by a neutral ambitious world. Or, as they say in biz, I had my girlfriend's remote control brother and the rest a date. To say that special effects were bad would be damaging in the area of ​​special effects. This is 2005, it is not difficult to photograph a car scene without a bright blue background. Yes, it was charming and modern when Hitchcock was filming "The Birds", but in 2005 it looked like a low budget. Avoid a cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and serve to make an actual attempt to comment willing to disbelieve. <br /> <br /> However, having seriously distorted the general concept of this film, let me tell you again that, with the sadness that may seem, this may be worth your time. If there is nothing else, it is tantamount to a trip beyond the bad science fiction - it is worth learning for a new movie and definitely deserves a refresher course for those who have seen some movies in their day. <br /> <br /> Crazy crazy mad-humped world with a hammerhead transmitter and receiver that thinks it's good to pour bottles of blood in nearby waters makes me not only wonder about the intelligence of mankind, but also about the ability of the "B" On the exit of reasonable plot lines remotely. <br /> <br /> This film also largely meets one of my bad intentions for a long film - the bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If this is not 2005, you will be threatened by the fact that this film was a kind of crazily bad metaphor for the Cold War. I mean that you may also have Khan on the bridge of Clyngon Pierce who runs the leak in Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines of the film is when the chick insists without a bra that looks like Charleston and Heston, "Wait Tom" as he tries to lift a helicopter to escape from the ground. The thing is that Tom misses the bad sunglasses guys with his never-ending tie and the Kalashnikov commentator, or AK-47, in terms of the average person. <br /> <br /> As the crazy world says near the end of the film "My goal is the development of the human race" - suffice it to say that this film contributed only to the transmission of humanity. The poor Freudian references that the crazy world uttered as he prepares for the protagonist to marry the hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction, we can all find something to laugh at.
