This was in short a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was clumsy. I did not feel any sense behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered hastily and I felt misplaced. He could have cited statues. The chemistry was between George C. Scott and Susan Yorke did not exist and watched the American Rochester feel strange. He could have tried at least to make a British accent. I love George S. Scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. I felt I was watching the highlights of Jane Eyre, where the main parts of the story were assembled randomly without regard to the flow of the story. The scene and the music were very beautiful, but I did not feel any of the passion and love that was supposed to be between Jane and Rochester, and left me completely unmoved. <br /> <br /> A good copy of Jane Eyre suggests you watch the BBC version of 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zilla Clarke or a 1997 copy with Cyran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these are great adaptations.
