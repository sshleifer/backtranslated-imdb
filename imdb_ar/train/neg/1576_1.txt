This movie has everything. The brilliant work of the camera, reminiscent of Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, the narrow representation of "heat," the explosive movement of Jerry Brockheimer's film, the intelligent dialogue of Tarantino's speech, and the epic sense of saying, "The Father" The judge has a severe temperature, but it also shows depth and true emotional intensity. His performance reminds me of Robert De Niro's portrayal of Jake La Mota in a revolving bull. <br /> <br /> Motion scenes are truly impressive, not because Bullet has a film that depicts such high-octane scenes and stylish cars. Special effects push the limits of technology and filmmaking to the limit. Independence Day set the standard that this film clearly matches and surpasses to a large extent. <br /> <br /> In general, he acts wonderfully through his own list (such as the Oscar Night Invitation List!), high-end websites, sweeping motion, and tight screenplay.
