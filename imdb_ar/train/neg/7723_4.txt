Well, I could not enjoy this movie much because of its religious values. It's a movie from B, directed by Commando, but it's very lame and ridiculous to look at as a good B movie with enough entertainment in it. <br /> <br /> It's a flick in the 1990s, but above all the film should be mentioned in the movie "The Eighties," when this type of B was at its highest. These films were always superior and did not pay much attention to her story or representation. It was all about blowing things up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This movie contains all the ingredients in it, but I really did not like watching this movie as much as I like watching similar kind of movies. It's hard to tell why really, because the story and acting are so bad as it was in any film of the same kind from the same era. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is often far too silly. All this kind of movies has ridiculous moments but this movie is just filled with it. Fighting, Dolph Lundgren runs around the shirt, characters, and story. All this is not very good because it is often very lame for words. The story sometimes does not even try to be a bit logical and what is the main drawing line for the gross movie? His story is ubiquitous, and it seems only written to create a film through a sequence of battles, battles with weapons and the like. These sequences are not good to watch too much. The moments are very short and very disappointing to see the truth, from the guy who brought us "commandos". <br /> <br /> It is primarily Dolph Lundgren, where he plays the role of a super hero star, who kicks violently with relative ease, knows how to deal with weapons and other weapons, and of course gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. All this brings us also one of the worst montage series in the history of motion movies, and certainly one of the worst sex series I have ever seen in any film. Both are just very lame for words and only very weak together. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really work. Good men are policemen but they do not seem to act like one of them. They are killed simply without having to face responsibility for anyone, and they are not very keen to make any arrests, or to tell anyone about their discoveries. Not even when they discover that a major Japanese crime syndicate is trying to seize the streets of Los Angeles, and the brewery company is working as a cover for a large-scale drug and drug trafficking plant. Just thought about it for a moment, what is the general purpose of Brandon Lee in the film? It was possible for the film to do easily without him and the girl too. <br /> <br /> Very silly, lame, simple, and amusing enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
