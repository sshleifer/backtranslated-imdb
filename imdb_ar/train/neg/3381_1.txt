This may be the worst adaptation film for Broadway music ever. So music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment is wrong. I'll say, though, that it's almost as bad as being funny. <br /> <br /> Hair styles are remarkably dated. For the rest of my life, I can not understand what is meant (theoretically) by opening the film with the exterior of the theater where it plays "A Chorus Line". Do we think these people are experimenting with a "chorus line", which contains stories about people testing? Oh no, the show collapses on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do this?
