For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it nice and wonderful how many young filmmakers make films, bringing together the creative ideas of other people to present a false premise for a film. Troops, Swingblade, any of Blair's charming parodies million come to mind. If all they want is a foot inside the Hollywood door, they do the right thing and they have to keep up with that because the combination of outlines is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard this phrase, "It's the House of Animals meets back to the future"; "It's Wall Street meets with the Society of the Dead Poet"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant originally and boldly and were not safe and predictable.
