I feel completely separated. Someone needs to recover $ 4.95 I spent in a blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. This is not musical, but a total waste of time and my absence. What I did not get is why this was distributed in the first place ?? I've seen better films coming out of film schools, and I've gone to a film school so I can say it as a fact. The quality of this work is also very bad to view ... Fire on DV ?? Said Nave. The songs are not songs but just kidding seems the same in every section. Want to see a good musical? Then do not rent this movie.
