Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever seen a movie that does not contain meat or potatoes. The whole movie felt like just a salad with no main dish. The storyline was laughable and funny, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was outside the window, and the animation was performed by four-year-olds. Does that cover? I have never been the most embarrassing concept in my whole life. I have never read comedy or seen other programs that have this character, but from the reviews of other reviews, I am not outside the base of my observation. <br /> <br /> At first, the story moved very quickly. For someone new in these personal attitudes, you need more design to create reasons rather than finding a solution. I've seen another anima (if you can call this an anime) who does great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing aside for the Lady of Death. In some short scenes, we see its train with Krimatore and instantly become this aggressive beast of hell. It was difficult for me to swallow, taking into account moments before advancing this weak and vulnerable woman dominated by her father. Suddenly, it is engulfed in hatred and can fight a battle with an existence millions of years ago. This was ridiculous. Mrs. Death's show was bad, to say the least. She felt as if she were not more of a moving figure than a desperate woman avenging the mind. For me, it did not work. They were no more than eye candy for pre-adulthood boys wanting to have huge amounts of skin that suddenly grew on their chests when training with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick just watching it. The same applies to the character of the Holocaust. Who was this random person? Their explanation was not enough, and instead left me more tormented than actual development. It is a very sad day in hell when we abandon characters to show more violence and movement, especially in animation. <br /> <br /> After that, there was the devil himself. Let me say that I think I can fight a battle with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was funny, he did not represent the image that was in my mind. It was as if Disney were in control and wanted to make it semi-computer. He lacked the darkness and the corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the governor of hell, but instead he was just a small servant with a bigger place to live. Talk about living or dying, how can you die again in hell? This was a concept that certainly needed further clarification. Most of the characters were worried about death, when they did not even consider the possibility of their death. So they reached hell. I think this level of thinking is what ruined the film for me. I did not quite understand the idea that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but that could be me ?? Or perhaps because of the lack of development in this story. There was nothing built, just preparation. <br /> <br /> The sequence of battles was very bad. Animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 1990s. There was nothing impressive about how this film was drawn. Why do we, America, lag behind animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's creeping up here because we continue to produce films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this film presents it. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a bad film. The animation alongside the heinous soundtrack was cheap. I went somewhere in this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I made this film on my credit card. The production was awful as well as the story. Nothing has been developed, leaving huge huge conspiracy gaps in which almost everyone has fallen. The power of the characters was lost, and nothing was explained. I have wasted my time with this time and I want to warn others so that death does not come, do not find yourself in my state and regret the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this garbage. <br /> <br /> Blah! <br /> <br /> Row: * Out of *****
