What an empty rendition and lacks a classic novel. I hope people stop messing with classics when they have no idea what the real intention or the original point is. This version is no different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fynz is much worse although casting Juliet Brioche Kathy should have the worst casting decision ever ... anyway return to this version. It aims to make the story relevant to the contemporary environment and in a musical way. I succeeded in both high art but better. View a look for a rainy day maybe ... the direction was average and the editing abysmal. Worst of old Quincy. Deepak Verma plays a big role as Hindley and is actually one of the lost talents in Britain. Part of Heath was played with great magic and faith and I think casting is the strongest point in this project. Although the most talented director would have benefited better from the facilities he owns. He was obviously a manager of the lease and did not plant the project with the passion he deserved.
