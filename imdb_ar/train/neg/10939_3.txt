This movie contains some of the worst behavior I have ever seen! Some scenes are as original as the nails coming through the floor. This nail trap holds these bad guys. The rest of the film degrades as you go. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 films of all time. I also can not believe that there are consequences! The next movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. Can REO.T.O really be worse? <br /> <br />
