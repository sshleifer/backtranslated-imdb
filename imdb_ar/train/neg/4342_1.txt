I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. They had a good story to go ahead with, but it spoiled it very badly. First of all, the cast is completely wrong, where did this player come from (peeball actor) and the puff father comes from ??? It seems that Carlito came from the cover and was used to comment with some real idiots. This film does not do "Carlitos Way" any justice. I am thrilled that the "Carlito's Way" series first appeared, if you had seen this trash first, you would not have given me the opportunity to issue a pacino version. In any case, Pacino is supposed to read this story, believing it to be nonsense and doing a sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
