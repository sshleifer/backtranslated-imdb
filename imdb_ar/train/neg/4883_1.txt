While filming the cheap video at the beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II, she wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is simple and careless. Ethel, who is obsessed with death by an eating disorder, is released in a halfway house because of overcrowding in the hospital. They are by far the most sensible inhabitants while a man watches the dead flies in the soup of the other. After that, Ethel scolded a middle-of-the-road worker with a chocolate bar after hitting a cost-cutting measure to feed dog food. Ethyl avenged him with a nozzle of wire on the stairs and then .... well, you get the idea. If all this sounds interesting, it is not. This film was made badly with cheap effects and worse acting. The characters are very wooden when presenting their lines so that they must stand in front of the cigar shop. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of memories of the past for Ethel I, Criminally Insane, which is a little better. Very weak effort.
