It's interesting that everyone who looked (so far) like this movie does not have any expectations - I think this is a trick. By contrast, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. Once you've seen how close the camera is always from the faces, you know we're in the hands of a very amateur director - this is always a clear sign on them, they think it's natural, effective or strong to keep the camera about two inches away from the actors. The actors in this film had only one facial expression. <br /> <br /> If the nearby camera is not enough, the lack of light in the film will kill it. The film seems to have been completely filmed in the dark. Now we know that the cinematographer was also amateur. "Oh, we'll light the group with an electric lamp! That will make it look warm!" No, this made everything invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to the serious technical flaws, there was no story beyond just a simple hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was lit. (This may be a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won two awards from the Film Festival does not indicate the quality of the film. The film, however, seeks the quality of these special festivals. I can assure you that this film will not win anything at the festival I saw in it. In fact, the film seemed to have ended twice during the film and people started to leave (this was one of the side effects of the "Darkness" technique). But when the film fluttered, instead, there were whines of the audience. Once the film finally ended, it was clear that it did not matter if it had already ended in either of the previous two points. Their earlier end would have saved the audience from more monotonous scenes of resettlement (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we got it, the life of the old man was boring - but we got to that one at first. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this audience should be missed, and that it has absolutely nothing to offer advanced filmmakers.
