Star Rating: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Bit Between ** The Delay * The Drilling * <br /> <br /> Some plutonium and some very bad people have disappeared. (Jodson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the help of Josh's adoptive daughter Kee (Jennifer Tong) who was appointed to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film about terrorism a year after 9/11. After filming in 2001, Norris himself then commented on the similarity of the plot line of the film with what happened in downtown New York that day, so there were those who were in the mood for a film where Norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass if anything else. Other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris ever had. It makes you wonder what the original did to justify the sequel in the first place, and whether this could get a man 3 president might come out sometime soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a movie of Norris, you've all seen it all and there's nothing new or unexpected happening with this movie, but at least you know what you'll get, like I said, maybe that's what Some need to reduce some steam. **
