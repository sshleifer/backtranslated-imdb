My friend made this video and I was very excited to watch it, but ten minutes after the slow singing of James Hetfield and Lars banging on a drum in what seemed like a slow motion, I began to think, Why? I'm watching this? This question will tour your minds in 5 ?? After 10 minutes of play. I prepared the tape the same day, as you suspect, not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
