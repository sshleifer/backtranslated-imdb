I felt disgusted by this film. It was not because of the graphic sex scenes, because it was destroying the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not carry much truth about her and her art. This shows one artistic work by Judith Behiding Holofernes, but shows that she entered as a witness in the rape trial when Judith did not paint her for the first time for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you have understood this from the film, and perhaps not, Tassi was not a noble character. He raped Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to have accepted false accusations of rape to prevent her from suffering during her torture. According to rape, he continued to claim that Artemisia (also known to have had sex with him) was never known while repeatedly saying "this is true". <br /> <br /> I encourage all of you people to come out and find the real Artemisia and see what they are. Do not build all your knowledge on this fantastic movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia already has an interesting story behind it and some amazing artworks. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but discover the real Artemisia story.
