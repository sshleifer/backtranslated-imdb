I understand that this film was produced with a very low budget but this is not an excuse for the brutality that is Grendel. Deathstalker, Throne of Fire, Queen of Barbarians, Conquest, Berber Invincible, was made on volatile budgets and particularly bad effects, but they are still able to create cult classics by adding some warriors who wear light clothes and sense of humor. Primal costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes gave Grendel the ability to be a very good film with very low value in sword and sorcery, but fashionmakers ruined this opportunity entirely using the very bad CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). Citizen Kane may not be a good example of how to produce a low-budget science fiction / adventure film with reliable special effects and attractive characters.
