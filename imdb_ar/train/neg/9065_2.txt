About halfway through, I realized I did not care about these characters at least; however, I saw a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I should not have been bothered. <br /> <br /> If you know anything about the movie in advance, you know that the leading character will be a crash survivor - and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what's going on. It will happen then - the phone will get and people call it! This was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad weather disaster). <br /> <br /> I realized that this was an old film, and the style of acting in those days was less natural than today. But even by these standards, the behavior was embarrassing. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I think this film was, more than anything else, an attempt by Beth Davis to help her husband (Gary Merrill) in his career. But to no avail - I have seen oak trees show a real passion more than he did. <br /> <br /> It may seem that Davis plays the role of paralysis (a non-brilliant role) as an ardent and daring career progression. Not so. It was just boring. It was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film, which made Trask (Merrill) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although less disturbing than Tiny Tim), quietly distributing wisdom about life and relationships without hinting that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene was affected, where Trisk telephoned his wife in Iowa to reconcile, and was acting excessively on both ends of the phone line, almost stumbled. I had to remind myself that these people actually got money for what they were doing in this film. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people enjoyed this movie. If you find him lifting it, that's great. But honestly, I found it bad. There are a lot of old movies from Hollywood's Golden Age that were written and represented much better.
