I know people have done some of the animation and graphic design and the show is terrible! They are small, rich children who have no talent, and perhaps begged Nick to accept them! Alex has played drums for a year, I've played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible as well as the show! This is the most comical comedy mad so it's not funny that I've ever seen it. It's very stupid that makes me want to fly! It's crazy that Nickelodeon never accepted anything like this and that's dumb! They are sooo dumb and weird! I hate them and show them and I think once Nick realizes how stupid he is, hopefully they'll take him off!
