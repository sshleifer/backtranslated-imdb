Well, Tivo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. He had 2.5 stars. He looked promising. It has descended very quickly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of exaggeration, even from Angelina. She is 20 years old and plays for a 16-year-old. There are three characters supposed to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian American. The original Italian accents were good, I thought. My young wife is nice, as my wife says. Everyone else in this movie is an overweight Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was chosen as a bad doctor, this was a bad sign. The couple chasing their children in the place looks like the four Italian officers. <br /> <br /> My wife will not give up on the remote control. Hopefully they were not taking makeup, dressing or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted mixture of hideous and dazzling. It was disgusting. <br /> <br /> Cutting the left ventricle was not enough to distract attention from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do it yourself and sparkle your head across the TV screen instead. You'll be glad you did. The only film I have ever seen in my life was worse than the movie "Hamburger: The Movie". Or perhaps a "killer friend".
