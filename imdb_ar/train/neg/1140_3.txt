It is scary, but in the sense that it will end before the age of 70 years. I saw it at the end of the night in 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like biscuits, it's better than none (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a little scary because it looks as if he's been bitten by the animal embalmer. Yvette Mimeux looks like smoking in the beautiful city center of Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a copy of Roy Rogers's version of Rosemary Baby. This is one Turkey should never be. If you were insomniac and ended at 1:30 am on Saturday and there was nothing but a roller-coaster purchase of the 1972 1972 Derby Chamionship game, I think that beats it. But God helps you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
