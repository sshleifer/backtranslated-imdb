The explosion of television channels must never be grateful to West Randolph Scott's production line, because at any moment there must be one that looks like a hundred films from Randolph Scott's movies running on one station with no budget at least. <br /> <br /> "The man behind the gun" is a typical melodrama dating back to the early 1950s with pre-World War II pre-war production values ​​based on a historical plot plot filled with motion scenes to conceal the complete absence of texts, Thriller. In the coming years, television programs such as Gunsmoke, Bonanza, etc. will play the role of these films, and this task has actually led to better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly cheerful in this, is the good man who fights against the bad guys who will eventually prevail. There is no more interest in what he is going through emotionally than his horse feels, unless you wonder if he will determine the initial misunderstanding as the female progresses in the end. Music is a stronger indicator of the emotional state of "characters" than acting. But it's good for your boat to float; I will not hit you because you enjoy "diagnosis, murder," as well. <br /> <br /> Factor like infantry and aging quickly. 3 stars for being efficiently put together; 0 for artistic endeavor.
