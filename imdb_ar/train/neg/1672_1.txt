This is the only film I have ever seen that has led me to write criticism on any website, and this is an important statement from someone who likes Monolith Monsters Attack. This movie is ideal for anyone who wants an inappropriate film. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I think this film is safe for children of all ages. This is ideal for anyone who does not want to entertain, challenge or motivate in any way. Adults can easily catch up with their sleep in front of the TV while children watch the movie. However, do not be surprised, if you wake up to find the kids have turned off the TV and started playing a board game. As an adult enjoying entertainment, and enjoying everything from mundane things to what is fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and motion, and all those things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate imagination, this film has nothing to show.
