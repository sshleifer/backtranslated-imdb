To be honest, I did not like the "executive decision" - which was clear to the mold - much, but compared to this piece of nonsense, it looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not only should people who move in the film (the term "actors be an insult to all other actors") be brought to more representative seasons, so that the man who built the setup has never seen a plane from afar. It's ridiculous, that in 747 only 3 flights aboard, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of irrationality (for example: use the sleeping gas, then do not use it, then use it anyway), which finally dropped my classification down. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun rearranging your sock or digging a hole in your knee and filling it with milk.
