The monkey is caught in the jungles of Africa by an opportunistic exploratory team; the beautiful daughter of the team leader finds it first. A large version of Tarzan's story has a good production, but it is the worst single direction of a film I have ever seen. John Derek is deprived of inspiration behind the slow motion shots and glimpses of the body of the wife of Derek Derek unclothed; he has almost a talent behind the camera like Ed Wood. In an attempt to sexual sex in the tongue, Dirks lacks the versatility, stinging timing, and taste. They have a sense of self-irony and give up the courage (they throw caution to the wind), but after a promising opening, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keefe (who may have had marble in his mouth all the time) has a starring role, but plays John Deerek's third ego and Bo Derek's sense of self-importance. * from ****
