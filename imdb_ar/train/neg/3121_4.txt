This film is poor trash. It is a horrible taste, a pedestrian and unconvincing in the text, although it is supposed to be based on real events - which do not add much but make it more than a disappointment. The direction is not well implemented as the viewer and the dialogue are misplaced. I'm not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To start, Williams is not convincing homosexual in the disintegration of the relationship nor the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his personality is disturbed by an anomaly of children that is base and has no place as a plot. Your older Rory Culkin discards "d_ck_smker" without a taste - in good fun - which is annoying enough and then laughed by Williams' character. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as an adviser to Williams' angel and was thrown into explaining the total failure in the end. The character of Tony Collett is extremely troublesome and reverberates her sixth-best performance in a weak direction. Miss very capable.
