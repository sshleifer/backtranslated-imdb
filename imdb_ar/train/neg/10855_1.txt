Surely this is one comedy that is not likely to be forgotten for some time. <br /> <br /> It will not usually bother me to comment on this movie: it's so small that nobody can see it anyway, but as it happens, it's kind of popular on P2P networks like Kazaa, so the saaad production must To be exposed to what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it? Well, of course it's not a comedy; instead, it means a horror click - "intended" is to be the keyword here. The script is an unbalanced, totally imbalanced mess, special effects especially just because they are particularly pitiful. As for representation, well, let's just say that if this is my play for graduating in elementary school, the teachers have burst into tears at our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I realize that this is a low-budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations, certainly with respect to things such as special effects. Also, although I am a fan of horror, I realize that these films are rarely the places to look for interesting texts and the highest representation. <br /> <br /> But still. <br /> <br /> B-B movies often contain some recovery features to compensate for under-funding, such as humor. Just laugh at Cradle to Fear lies in ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor in it - and within the first 20 minutes or so, you can gradually back down - that's the only thing the film shows. Oh, this and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting it is. <br /> <br /> As for the story, they are not even trying to convey anything: victims are either drug users and / or engage in serious crimes. Lesson: Watch out for boys and girls rioters, because one day you will have to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> Relax my case. <br /> <br /> So all in all, some kind of sex, a good amount of drugs, but certainly rock and roll. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this one out of 10, but I'll go to 0 if possible. Or maybe I will not: it's worth 1 to dictate the names of the actors correctly in the titles. I mean, this thing, innit?
