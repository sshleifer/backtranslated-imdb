I've seen my share of Woody Allen movies, and although it's not always great, you can usually make sure you're enjoying yourself. Perhaps the very last one is Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - and since then, the ones I've seen are incomplete but circumventable. So when I was invited to watch the new Woody Allen movie "Melinda and Melinda", which I did not know yet, it was released happily. I did not hear much about her, so I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got is certainly the worst film I've ever seen in Woody Allen. The premise is overstated, the cast is awful, the script is slow and unimportant. A lot of scenes did not say anything, but were extended, I suppose I fill out what would otherwise have been a short 15 minute film. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the concept behind this film - two directors discussing how a simple position can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and it is clear that the film goes on to show us that, by playing both scenarios. The problem in these two films is no good at all. Comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not too tragic. It seems that Allen has come up with a good idea but time runs out, or runs out of time, to actually complete the film. <br /> <br /> The overall level of representation is also remarkably bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, which is basically Woody Allen's impression. In the past good actors such as Chloe Sevigny were bearing fruit, and the worst thing is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because her character in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> It is fair to actors that the script they work with is lacking if it does not exist. Certainly far from Allen which we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
