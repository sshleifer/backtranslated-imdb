This "film" starring unknown actors seems likely to remain this way, but this is the other flick that surprises me how this movie was released. I have no problem with the horrors and jokes that are vulgar in particular, they are really my favorite. But when this BAD is finished, it takes the monkey really and no wonder that this kind of games faces a difficult time. The story is a clich√© and without the imagination possible with a handful of people in a cabin in the forest that has been cut and penetrated by this zombie / stealthman. It is not the story that absorbs more than others, but it represents representation and horror and heinous, it made at home the quality of guidance and soundtrack terrible. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and making of some incredibly slow films - these temples are out in the daylight and yet, we are supposed to believe it is a night ?? What the hell was the director thinking about this move? What, he had only one day to photograph all this in? Was he afraid of darkness? (It's fun to see a policeman walking around in the daylight with a flame that behaves as though it's a black temperature, though) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side of the actors is that they look like people working in the local supermarket so at least they can escape Of this film without noticing anyone before. I'm sure that one of the "teenagers" plays bingo in the local bar - but it is 40-45 years old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good to laugh but just another waste of time and movies.
