Another case for a decent DVD case is betrayal of the quality of the video shot. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rushon does a good job and damn it! The cast is good-looking. I have never seen that many players interested in space loitering together on a regular basis. This film really wanted to make you think that Rushon was a murderer, but not so. My big problem in the film was that in the end I did not care much about who was the killer, and the real killer was not very meaningful, because it was blue and the directors were thinking "Ha", and Picha did not see that one coming, sucker! Yes, there were continuity errors around (mainly with the constantly changing Rochon wardrobe ms), but for a standalone folder, this is not bad. I was sure at first that it was just a veiled excuse for the girls to be naked, but that was just a gimmick. The dialogue was sometimes overly painful. <br /> <br /> You do not have high expectations of getting this, and that will not be bad. Lloyd Kaufmann's veil is wonderfully wonderful.
