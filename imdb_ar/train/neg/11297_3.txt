Jenny Newman (from "MISTRESS OF THE APES," HELL NIGHT, etc.) is Helen Seelik, the American actress who has a leading role in Australian theatrical production. She is a virgin because she was a little girl who sees her mother having sex and then caused the car accident that she accidentally killed. Meanwhile, a black glove wandered around the theater and hit people with shards of glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> It is clear that the killer is Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, blood is washed on her hands after the killings and is seen killing a university child With a broken bottle as a little girl!), But this has a wonderful effect on a highly breathing POV camera and hides a killer's identity to the end as if it should be a big surprise. <br /> <br /> It seems that the entire staff is obsessed with talking about or practicing or trying to have sex, and in one case, even blackmail on their way to get laid. There is a great deal of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, mysterious photography and editing (by Colin Eglestone, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The musical adaptation of the movie Soavi of the same name and opera OPERA (both better) is preceded by five years, and Noman is very hot.
