Well ....... Unlike other pre written comments, I must say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one person in the film is somewhat like Jason Donafon who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how to get any awards, although I'm sure a lot of effort has been made to make them useless because the final result is that it screams in early foreign series in the early 1990s. The plot was non-existent, and filming was hopeless and the representation was on par with the performance level. It has been a long time unfortunately and the subdivisions were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... If your favorite friend sleeps with your ex-friend for 6 years after just two weeks of breakdown, you will not all remain the best of friends. Everything was a fantasy. That's it! Oh yeah, the strange 90 home / soft core indie mind awesomeness!
