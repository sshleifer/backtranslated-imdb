I may not have the longest period of interest, but this is the second film I have refused to watch all the time, and I bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a decision, something to laugh, or something to keep my interest, but that decision never came. Instead, the writing was laughably comic, as the film started and was disappointed, like someone cutting a television series down to the full length of the feature. The Academy must have dealt with drugs when it was nominated for at least eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat myself again. This is the second film I refused to watch all the time. The first was the "pesticide". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 10/01
