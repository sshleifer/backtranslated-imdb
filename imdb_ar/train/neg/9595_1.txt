In the recent movement to bring Asian films to America, this is the last film to be released here. Being a fan of Asian movies of all kinds, I was browsing the Internet and watching this release to be reissued in the US market, so I decided to check it out early and rented it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the movement are incredibly disappointing, the Tiger Tiger and Iron Monkey burst out of the water. Jet Li was asleep watching the sequence of fighting. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better off with Jackie Chan flick !!! <br /> <br /> Moreover ... you think you will see martial arts with a girl soaked in revenge for her parents death but a surprise! A good hour of this film is filled with dialogue, lack of movement, lack of development of a painful scheme, and nothing to do with the hypothesis we are exposed to. Has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy in his group of plot in which the producer / director did not devote any time to nullify things, yet devoted part of the film to withdraw the case. It would be better if they cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Speaking of it, I do not really think that I did the choreographed dances of Iron Monkey, the sequence of action in Princess Blade. I have completely underestimated the frequent use of slow motion and rapid changes in the camera to quickly portray physical killers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you please do not waste your time / money with this movie. The premise is sedition, and you may be tempted by the trailer, but I'm sure this film is not suitable for the audience (perhaps in Japan but not in the states) and the worst movie will be brought to the states of the Asian film industry.
