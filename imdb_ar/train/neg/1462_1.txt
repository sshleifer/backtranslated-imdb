This may be the worst film I have ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is not close to historical accuracy. It starts badly and then descends from there. We have Hitler's father cursing his bad luck on the "fact" that he married his niece! They were in fact, second cousins. The mother of Hitler, Clara, his father, Alois, was described as "free" because Wallis had been adopted and raised by Clara's grandfather and grew up as his son, when he was indeed his nephew. Alois was much older than Clara, and so when she was a child she used to call Wallis, "Uncle", the scene in the trenches where Hitler mocks his fellow soldiers and decides to take him on his dog is simply a disgrace and insult To intelligently all viewers. We see Hitler chasing the dog through the trench, when he pursues the poor thing that continues to crush him for his disobedience. At a distance we see and hear that his colleagues continue to mock and hunt down the cowardly little man, but then a shell fell directly on his oppressors, and all of us were finally killed instantly. How then, if Hitler is the only person who survived the scene, is this story of brutality and cheese? Did Hitler himself go around about "boasting" about it? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In the next stage, Hitler flounders and terrorizes a poor and war-weary Jewish officer and fears that he will be given a crucifixion! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was tired of winning before the fight for the homeland. My school brought some promised medals from his shop, because I am sure that the steel crosses were not distributed as described in this comic parody. <br /> <br /> All the vulgar videos here, not least the sedative and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on his side. Then they may have discovered that the "Merry Widow" of Franz Lehr was likely to float the FÃ¼hrer more than any "Dutch bird" from the cannon of Richard Wagner! <br /> <br /> Hitler may be responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he forgive his awful taste in music? <br /> <br /> I can go on but I'll stay there for hours. <br /> <br /> Miss.
