"ITS A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD" is located at the top of my list at all times for the greatest comedy films ever made, this one at the bottom. (Of course, I might be wrong - I did not see "SAVING SILVERMAN"). In other words, it's a lame, lame, lame comedy, lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of ** ***
