Although the film is at Ivy League, it was filmed entirely in northern Arizona, mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in autumn 1976. I participated in the theater department there, and most of the additions in the film were then members of the department The stage. <br /> <br /> There is a totally ridiculous scene in this film (if you know Arizona geography) that shows many team members riding bikes from college to a table. We know that the campus and the creek in question (actually Oak Creek Valley) are about 35 miles away and although the trip there is all steep, it would be literally impossible to ride a bike in the same way!
