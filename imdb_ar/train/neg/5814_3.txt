The film achieved what it was meant to do: show how the girl adapts to poverty and grows in her maturity stage. However, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most cases with more twist than done here. The film focused on the breasts, which quickly became boring and lost interest. If this is on TV, I will go to the latest news in the Starr report. This is how boring this film is found.
