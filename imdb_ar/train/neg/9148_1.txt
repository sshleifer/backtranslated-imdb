I was looking for Imdbs down 100 because I thought ID did not see anything as bad as the 9th plan of outer space or the Roller Ball edition, I was wrong. Both Ben and Arthur beat both. <br /> <br /> The many films I've seen are the worst in my life. Bad management, bad characters, terrible acting, terrible story there is no one reason but Sam says anything positive about this film. Sam was a terrible troublemaker, but his removal was so bad that he could only be knocked out by Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The manager should be ashamed of his job Unfortunately, I have to give him at least one star but he deserves - be a follower.
