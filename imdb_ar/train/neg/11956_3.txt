Stinks this movie. I do not think I ever saw a film like this. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was wonderful and the acting was thin. This can be a good movie. I think they only relied on its horrific images. I usually deal with graphic scenes and human taboos, but I felt Miike filmed them for release. One bad film execution. There is nothing to enjoy by watching this movie unless you are fascinated by the exhaustion of yourself with clear scenes of incest, sexual abuse of children, death, rape, self-indulgence, parent and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersion. I think I sold the film to many of you, but I meant when I said this stinks. I've been successful in other films, but I think you'd be better off watching someone recover.
