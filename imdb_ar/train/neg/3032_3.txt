Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies yet. Everything I was told by this person after watching this film has lost its credibility. It is terrible. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the different scenes, take my words for it, sex scenes are not interesting at best. At first, Jenna was in the street clothes the most prominent thing in the film (she looks good) but she is all down from there.
