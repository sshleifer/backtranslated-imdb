Jerry Spies Tom listens to a story crawling on the radio and takes the opportunity to scare his enemy. <br /> <br /> I did not find this episode very funny: the humor seemed fairly restricted and the entire group was ready kinda lame (Jerry is basically the "bad guy" in that person, torturing poor Tom for no particular reason). <br /> <br /> There is a flash from time to time for inspiration (such as Tom's experience in the crafty heart) and at the moment when the life of nine of his body is released. But, in general, this effort lacks hectic speed, For most of the other cartoons for T & J.
