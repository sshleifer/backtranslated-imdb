Yes ah, VS series, MVC2 is the top. It has been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew sleeps at work, unfortunately half of the game has happened. Do not get me, it's fun, but you're tired of the mash buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA ... there is no conspiracy. This guy finally won and win! Er, who plays this on its own anyway?
