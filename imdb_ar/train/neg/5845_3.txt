After watching this well, I can say that it is not the worst film at all, yes, there is worse, there are some good points for the movie, you can watch drunken teens, horrible death, and nice rat looking some scientific experiments, A drunken janitor, an eccentric doctor, and a girl in a lingerie thong that has no shame, "the stupid cops," I could not wait in person for the rats that eat those drunken fools, I was wandering around the rat soon, Her good premise, the first part of the film was interesting with the exploration of the attic I was a rat, the story of a small return, but I think it was destroyed when the teens entered intoxicated peers playing, Rat was in my opinion, the person who lost, her name, Brenda, very fake, must be cGi rat, This schlocky was pretty, lame, but not terribly awesome,
