The director in the film "Behind the Scenes" mentions that he likes horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as leading directors like George A. Romero and Toby Huber. The dedication of this film to great directors is like giving your mother a piece of Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. CAST people that can work. Also, he does not throw a 40-year-old man for his misunderstood role, an 18-year-old boy. That's right, I've been in high school for 22 years. The reactions people show as they watch their friends bursting with their hearts are funny. Or as one part when a man is stabbed in the ear with the ear of corn (Haha), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh .. my God?" Scarecrow itself is completely personal. Fluctuation stops cars and calls losers. <br /> <br /> The movie contains one recovery factor ... Oh, no, no. <br /> <br /> If you should see this movie perfectly, just watch the rock and roll trailer on DVD. It covers about everything and really has a dude song.
