Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (like Frank Cooper) is a Mexican-American Border Policeman. He is the father figure of the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants to be Mr. Savalas the best man at his forthcoming wedding. Savalas Saab, but coach Eddie Albert (as commander Moffat) may be tougher. Tough is what you need to stop the getaway Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances may be in a state of constant change. <br /> <br /> If you can hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" speaking in terms of being repugnant, you should stay away from "The Border". If not, you may not have the stomach for a "real" cow slaughter scene. Although it does not end with great value, Mr. de la Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Lena) are stealing the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Tally Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
