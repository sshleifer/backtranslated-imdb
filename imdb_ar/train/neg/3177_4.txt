I have to admit that her "dead body" was not really as bad as I expected, and my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I just felt like going forward and seeing terror in front of my eyes, but this was not really so bad. I was expecting this terrible film only, but it seems the book does not mean any harm, but Eva's selection of Longoria (Parker, sorry) seems to be in an inappropriate position for the film. I think I probably found it a little better without them, just bothering me. But Paul Rod and Bill Lake had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat popular. But you have to admit, there was no meaning to this film, it was one quick salary check for the actor type. The movie could have been more entertaining if someone had really cared about him and had a better team. <br /> <br /> Henry has lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed on the snow on her wedding day. But when his sister moves him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls on her, but Kate chases her from behind the grave. Kate feels jealous and does not want Henry to go so fast and make sure Ashley does not punish him by tormenting her day and night by walking, believe me, Kate's voice, that's scary. <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good movie, I'm not sure if it's worth the money, but I'll give it to you if you want to see it or you're curious. Eva Longoria does not have enough starry power to make the film a success, and she does not attack anyone she likes. She belongs only on the small screen above the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, she still seems very unpopular with everything she pulls, or her "homely" boyfriend, Dan, again, not loved. With some rewriting and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but instead we get the average romantic comedy that can be predicted and will leave it with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
