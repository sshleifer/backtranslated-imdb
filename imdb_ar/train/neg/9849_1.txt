This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It's a bad thing, even in the standards of the level of television films. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the names known in this film are lost on confused and uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this excuse for a movie together - it's very bad. Described as "self-terror" - it's definitely appalling. There is nothing exciting about this. It can do you psychological damage! The initial opening scenes were such a promise - a possible possibility of whether the soul was just a facet of the brain, but the sheer shame of the car crash was unimaginable. No matter how hard you try, you can not care about characters. There are many ideas that have been sprinkled so that the film is at best a collection of phrases separate from the Chinese philosophers, and at worst the film will make you go to Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 movies on DVD, and this is the first one I will recoup my money on. Clear steel.
