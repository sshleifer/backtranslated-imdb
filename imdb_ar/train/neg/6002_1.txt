"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a rubbish. The representation is terrible, the atmosphere does not exist and the characters are interesting. The only scary thing about this scum is that the majority of IMDb users gave it 10. This is really horrible. There is no threat, no suspense, violence or nothing. Bruce Campbell ("Dead Evil" and "The Outsider") is completely lost, and the supporting crew is also awesome. Yes, some people may like this image, especially a mainstream society, but fanatic horror fans or hunting dogs will not enjoy this folly. I personally hate comedy horror movies, best horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left". The view, supposed to be a real scary horror film, is very bloody and disturbing, without the stupid humor, which usually destroys the entire concept. This film is not scary, not something, not funny comedy, so do not waste your valuable time.
