They were soon joined by a friend of Daphne, a strange head full of madness with sex. There are saints creatures, the nasty little dolls that kill people by giving them the desire of their hearts. Kyle's desire in the heart is to mate with a lucky creepy woman in spandex. Nick's basic desire is to throw grenades in a cafeteria in primary school - I mean a nightclub. The desire of the heart of Kevin is to overcome the slim Baltic with nunchucks. Amy's desire in the heart is to be disgusting slut. Daphne is already a disgusting slut, so she has no heart desire. Along the way the really hideous band really sings a really weird song. Hopoblin birds randomly return to where they came from and then exploded.
