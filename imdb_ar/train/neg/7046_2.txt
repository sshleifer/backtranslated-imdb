I've seen this waste of time on the HBO comedy channel, so I innocently assumed that this was a comedy. But there is nothing funny here. The good blog is basically wasted on a scenario I could write with my left left foot - after being senselessly beaten by the perpetrators of the Inquisition in the fifteenth century. The first half is particularly bad, because it contains some of the most obscure and futile dialogue I've ever encountered in a period of time, and a zero-sum conspiracy I'm not talking about. The fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are present in this small film and with less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. Some gentle shots of the waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that is created just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family links, preferably this) and / or a lot of money.
