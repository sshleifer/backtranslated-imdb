The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "woman". I do not know whether it's deliberate or not, but if you're sure, I got some laughter from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But these were the only laughter the film got. It does not mean he was aiming at laughter, it's a terrible film for paradise! The film is more terrible than meaning. It is shameful that such a hypothesis is wasted in horrific moments so that the viewer can not be unbearable (certainly not for the faint of heart !!)! It was not necessary to show all the things presented. I do not go into a moral obligation (because films do not really have these kinds of tasks or jobs) discuss what is shown here, but this is a new low level in the whole "torture movement" that has grown in the last few years!
