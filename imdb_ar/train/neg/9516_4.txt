Frank Sinatra plays the role of an unpopular former soldier, a frustrated writer who lives hard and drinks heavily, returns to his hometown in the Midwest and joins up with his scruffy brother Arthur Kennedy, who is now a big city shot with an indifferent wife and daughter. Frank is involved with the gambling gambler Dean Martin, the uneducated circus Shirley McLean, and has some maneuvers with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle with a good woman. The overly simplistic drama on the soap opera, with the role of McLean who turns overly "colorful" and emotionally awkward (her drunk control on "after she went" is the highlight of the film, and is dealt with expertly). Director Vincente Minnelli directs this straight forward, but he is in an amazingly miraculous state, and most of the large scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks unbelievably beautiful in a widescreen, with a nice look for more detail and texture, but the story and these characters are stuck in the buzz. ** from ****
