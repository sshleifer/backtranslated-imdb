Chris Rock, who seems to be desperate for a comfortable star car that expresses his appeal to mainstream black and white audiences, is a 1978 "Heaven Can Wait" comedy with an urban agenda. He plays the role of a comedian struggling in a car accident whose spirit has been removed from him very soon from his body - and so his angels must find another body to put him in. He can only come with the body of a white businessman. The rewriting of a film as cute and emotional as "Can Wait for Heaven" only shows that Eye Rock was at the box office (it was a tough institutional move organized by most Hollywood mercenaries). Why not fight for something more luxurious or memorable than the ridiculous reincarnation comedy that culminates in an evening in Apollo? The great support team (including Regina King, the great Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and Frankie Faison) do their best, but Rock seems awkward and unsure all the time. * 1/2 of ****
