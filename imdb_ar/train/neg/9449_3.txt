Dr. Sus will surely be crazy now if he survives. Cat in the Hat proves how film production can take a classic story and turn it into a pile of idiots. We have Mike Myers as an infamous cat in the hat, a big mistake! Myers proves he can not act in this film. He behaves like a girl showing a brissy with a thousand tricks up his pack. All the children in this film are fine, somewhere between the boring and disturbing lines. The story is like the original story with two discs and like most movies based on other stories, do not modify the original story! Bringing the wicked neighbor Quinn was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who will not get anywhere in life. This movie is like a repulsive comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The movie certainly does not look tacky! Sure, there are funny jokes for adults, just as the cat breaks off its tail and the sergeant bursts out before saying a rather sinister and funny word. At least Grinch was brave, and the film was already good! This film is a caricature of mucus in bright colors and mediocre representation. Was Mike Myers up in this film actually? And another thing, fish. What's with those dumb fish! The first time you see it, it's a real fish. The next time you see it, everything is moving and talking. But it looks like a moving piece of dough rubber toys! This film is total off the wreck of the target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I was surprised by it even if he had good jokes like the joke riding the water park, it was so good. So, if you have the option, watch Grinch instead of this mess.
