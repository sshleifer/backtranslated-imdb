A sequel to (actually a remake of) the live Disney edition of the 1996 101 Dalmations. Crosella Deville (Glenn Close) was released from prison after being "cured" of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (Lav!). But "healing" has been broken when Carrolla heard the toll of Big Ben, and went again in a crazy quest to make herself an ideal coat of hide skins. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad at many levels, beginning with the fact that Thanksgiving for the Family is designed to absorb every dime available from the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close Excessive over-doing of Cruela. With all she had to put in this film - lame script, endless make-up, eventually getting bread - I hope they've been given a very big salary. <br /> <br /> (If we talk, anywhere in the world you will find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelit restaurant, all of which are inside the same building - as you do at the height of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be dogs. They are the "Macaulay Culkin's" for this film, where they attract all the stupid "Home Alone" idiots to the bad guys. (Their biceps in the crotch, running on their hands with luggage carts, their ice flow, etc., etc., etc.) I must admit, that the dogs were fairly good actors - much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely lost in this film as a strange French gazelle. The human "dog lovers" - rephrased from the previous film, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they eat a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the film cuts back and forth between the lovers, their dogs at home, and they watch the dinner scene of "Lady and Tramp." I thought to myself, "Oh please, do not go there!" I was expecting people to do a satire in the "Lady and the Tram" dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing the Strand Spaghetti Kiss, pushing the meatball with his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> Do not let me start with the annoying parrot with Eric Eidel's voice. <br /> <br /> Fashion was nominated for the Academy Award, and fashion in the film * Good. But they are the only good thing in the film. The rest of it is an unbearable Drake.
