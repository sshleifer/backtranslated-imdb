This is the kind of film that shows the scarcity of French cinema when it comes to making thriller films. The director's desire for "American Voice" is so stark that you will not be fooled after a minute, unless you've seen a serial killer movie ever since "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two policemen (or one and a half, more like, as you can see), horrible murders, a plot more complicated than the complexity. Charles Berling is not lucky in this genre (see the film "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" stupid stupid a few years ago). The viewer is supposed to be with his pregnant wife - Joe Noir's counterpart to the rest of the plot - among the worst ever filmed. Add a scene saturated with love between them and an autopsy to get PG 12 and thus to attract the huge teen audience. A violent and silly conclusion, followed by a silent conclusion that can make a nice commercial advertisement for Cote d'Azur, is truly the silence of the lame.
