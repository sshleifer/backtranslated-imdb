First, let us all agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be considered a skillful actor, even barely fit, and sometimes just bad. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the entire film industry sunk. <br /> <br /> First, let's start the plot. A veterinarian in Vietnam named Jack Kelly, also known as the soldier (supposed to be as tough as a leather belt and then some, which you can believe when he pushes a bunch of nails through the feet of two legs and puts them on the ground) gets a word that his family has been killed and kidnapped His sister. So he goes on an individual mission to save his sister. He had some potential, but still very thin. <br /> <br /> Now, acting. As a representative of myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the worst actors in the history of art !!!!! Lamas, well, is the same. "Fan / Survivor" novels should be lifted and shot because of her alleged performance that humiliates actors everywhere, especially the talented ones who do not get a break! <br /> <br /> Finally, work. Fighting with firearms at its best, and opposing the grip is pitiful. I've seen more real-life battles at the Renaissance Festival (and those were fantastic)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to: Avoid this piece of CACA at all costs! If the only movie in existence, you still want to avoid it! In order to calculate brain cells, you do not see this thing!
