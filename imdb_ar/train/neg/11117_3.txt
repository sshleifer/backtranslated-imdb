Spooks is an interesting trash basket, containing some well-orchestrated sequences, silly intrigues, dialogue, and some third-class representation. <br /> <br /> Many have described this as a copy of the UK "24", and one can see similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares silly, weak plots, but executions are many beliefs and sexes and I think it's expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe poor comedy as "a nice comedy." <br /> <br /> This is a story of a nice spy story, and the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me a smile on any day.
