I caught this movie on AZN on cable. It looked like a good movie, the "green card" Japanese. I can not say that I have never loved an Asian film, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean films. I am a fan of John Wu's films in Hong Kong. I'm not hurting with hearty films like Tampopo or Chung King Express, so I thought I wanted to. Well, better cut my wrists and drink my blood than watch this hard movie that is behaving badly again. <br /> <br /> I think the director Stephen Okazaki must have escalated the water with Quaalude, because no one in this movie was a character. When any of the DID characters try to act, instead of mumbling in a line or two, their performance appears as a false and unreasonable force. Frankly I did not think anyone had acted before ... The only person who looked real was Brenda Aoki .. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I did not laugh once. What is most surprising is that the morning news of CBS described this as "the same refreshing of comedy." It was not refreshing, not soul in comedy. The end was very predictable, the former reviewer should be foolish to think about such things. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you want to see a predictable line of boring plot and wooden representation. In fact I think the movie "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better film than this ... I came out halfway through this movie!
