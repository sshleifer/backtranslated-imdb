Men, I like police movies full of movement, shooting, chasing and so on. <br /> <br /> Boy, I've created after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We have seen all this before, the hostages, the bank, and the surroundings ... However, the two bad guys who have shot down many officers and innocents who simply remain in the fire queue - without being beaten because of some Kevlar. br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Back to the bank, where the silent hostages did not close the safe or doors when the bad guys came out. To what extent the director was stupid we thought we would be. <br /> <br /> Well, the footage between this fake documentary was good, but after watching the film, I only thought about why the police did not understand? A decent shooting course? Why were there so many policemen and Swat was in a real long break. Really bad.
