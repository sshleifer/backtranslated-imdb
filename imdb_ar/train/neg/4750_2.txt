I'll give it 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story of the story was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were very short and brief, and hence the moral did not emerge clearly. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but it seems that Shin Kuyamada has a hard time dealing with his role. I can see the need to place western elements in the display, however, there are certain parts, where Chinese elements were also needed! Punk for example. His physical appearance was like a robot, rather than something outside Chinese culture. The final and worst drawbacks were the incorrect and distorted facts that were put into the show. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that this is a "children's show" and, therefore, there is no need for such a large hike. Standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of story and presentation development. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies should be better searched and better planned. Good presentation is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves depend on.
