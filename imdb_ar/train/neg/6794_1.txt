Friday step 13th more! There is an officially worse film of your hateful series. I won this movie in a college competition, and it was a waste of money even if it was free. Jack Jones plays the role of a terrible singer who tries to find some killers or something. At least on Friday XIII never bored me. I'd better pull my nails out of seeing this again.
