This is an interesting treat for a completely controversial subject (read only the other comments on this film). You obviously love or hate her, and most people seem to make that distinction based on whether they think the ordeal and the end times will happen as they were filmed in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its sequel - was made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​below are directly with Plan 9 of Outer Space and represent at the same level as Glenn or Glenda (apologetic to Ed Wood). If we put the religious message aside, the story is as frightening as it is. Add even the slightest idea that the story may actually be close to something that may happen in the future and become more frightening. <br /> <br /> This movie and its subtitles did not try to bring the movie. The causes of the ordeal when it occurred. Try "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" to get everything done "Thief" and explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East leading to it. The net effect was "Thief" did a much better job in the scary part of the film, instead of spreading himself too thin in an attempt to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget politics and watch this movie and its aftermath, as they are - horror stories. The horror stories that God tells, indirectly, may be more frightening. If she makes you think about the subject, she did her work - even if she did not believe at all.
