I watched this movie 15 minutes ago, and still do not know what I just saw. Mainly, I think it's a film about the S & M "star" on the Internet from CD Rom discs that are as realistic as the flash graphics on the Internet. She was killed by someone, causing her sister and a smashing team of two FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide section of Big City, the United States, is also investigating, although most of its work is done by reducing the number of CDs that are allegedly "real" like the real thing. I know. wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only film player who has any kind of credit behind him. He is in the film for 15 minutes, and half knocks the main girl for no apparent reason. I will not explain the end, because frankly I can not make it myself. But before the final scene, we treated Montag 3 or 4 minutes of everything in the film. Frankly, they could then run the final scene and have the same effect with the cross-section and all. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I was really able to use these 80 minutes in something else and I was more comfortable. Like, play that game with a knife where you press your hand repeatedly. That would be for 80 minutes more entertaining.
