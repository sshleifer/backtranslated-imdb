This show was terrible too. For George one is not funny, and his little arrogant children. He also treats his mother with disrespect. As a Hispanic, I am very angry at this show and the way in which the characters are portrayed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the dysfunctional family thing was done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when you do other programs millions of times? I thought ABC would come to her senses and pull that piece of garbage out of the air, but unfortunately, we'd have to recognize this until they "jumped out of the shark." <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they did already.
