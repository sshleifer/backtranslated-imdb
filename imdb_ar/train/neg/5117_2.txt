I want to first mention that I am a Christian (and I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it means to work in a feature film, so I have a call to filmmakers in this regard. I am all for positive messages and progress if they are compatible with the nature of life (that this is the falling world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am happy because others have overwhelming positive reactions to the overt Christian message. To me, execution was the place where the film took place. The film lives and dies on his story and here you have one of the dimensional stereotypes, the exhibition is plentiful, and the spontaneous changes in personal behavior are inexplicable to say the least. I think the film should not take you upside down in his letter to clarify the idea. I'm sure Kendrick Bruce. Will improve over time and that their storytelling styles will as well. Maybe they can direct someone else's scenario as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not my very first love, but can be a good inspiration (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) in several ways. If you're interested in a PG-inspired movie, Steven Soderbergh gives "King of the Hill" a look. All truth is the truth of God ...
