This rendition of Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers) makes magic Christians and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS similar to Fellini's works. Raquel Welch, with a stunning body (not really too long) in a lead role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was very good) plays Rex Reed (a bad film reviewer, not a critic) and surrounds her by dragging the queen West, John Huston horny, young and "naive" Farah Fossett (pre-Lee Majors, what a shame), and various types of creeping crawling to mock the WAY may not work because except for the old overlapping films (Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lina Horn) ... just so that they can continue to take the life out of everyone. <br /> <br /> A 2 of 10. Best Performance =? It's very bad, it's worth watching!
