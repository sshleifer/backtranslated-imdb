Two out of 10 possible - this is overly generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with representatives of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gosette Junior and Henry Thomas - how they could miss. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can not help wondering which drugs Sam Sheppard had taken out of this country at the end of the week. I have always doubted that Sam S. It was a kind of nuts, this film, based on his play, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is a B type arts. That actors love to drown their teeth in because it gives them a chance to imitate infinity. However, for the viewer sitting in this irrational trash, there's nothing you like about this movie. <br /> <br /> You did not see dysfunctional families until I saw this group. Ba crazy, what crazy, crazy son and daughter, oh yeah, crazy. They also have mouths on them talking in words that will make the cheeks blush, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot - which is also poorly readable - has a slot the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> He conspires to sell his rundown farm. As I found out, I do not now claim to be an expert in real estate, but the last time you check, co-ownership must be signed by both owners to be sold. If only one of them owns the property, the other will not be able to sell it legally, so it would be useless to do that person. Mr. Shepherd preferred to ignore this fundamental fact, so his plot did not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else was really working anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason for anyone I have to watch this movie if they are so desperate to see James Woods in my front nudity is full, and I can not imagine why anyone wants to.
