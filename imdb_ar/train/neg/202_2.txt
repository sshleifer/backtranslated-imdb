This is not the sound of bees, this is the effect of watching this very long, extremely boring film, which acts badly. How did I spend that three and a half hours without falling asleep? The plot is simple ... 3 Totally Idiot It's impossible to talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. I thought Romer was a murderer. This is worse, if possible. > I have to be really masochia if you can watch this whole movie without stopping it ... or killing someone.
