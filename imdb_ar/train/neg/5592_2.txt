It's hard to describe this film and one wants to try hard not to dismiss it very quickly because you feel that this movie may be just the perfect movie for a 12-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> This film has a beautiful concept, the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a touch. She has some of the stills she dreams of and some nice drawings of the little boy's relationship with his working mother and his schoolmate ... a beautiful beginning you might say, but then become a little greedy, greedy, trying to be a science fiction, drama, thriller, romantic love story Potential, myth, comedy and everything under the sun. The result left the public feeling somewhat inadequate. For example, the scene in which the girl (played by Riza Goto) woke up in a kiss (Yuki Cohara), rather than being romantic, is trying to be scary to make us laugh afterwards ... It is a cheap trick, because it spoils all the anticipation and passion that He was trying to build it for the better half of the film. <br /> <br /> I did not read the original story on which the film is based (it is a famous work by comic artist Osamu Tezuka, famous for his fascinating and complex stories). I wonder if all the problems are in the original story or did they happen to adapt? It is somewhat illogical even for someone familiar with the "funny logic" of those Japanese comic books. For example, how did Yuki Kohara get to the hospital in a moment (when it was supposed to be a long bus ride) to escape the character of Risa Goto in front of the TV cameras immediately after watching her live on television? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly (not very imaginative!) from other movies and they all seem to be in vain. The famous scene "The Lion's Mouth May Cry My Hands" from "The Roman Feast" <br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing ... It fails to be a fairy tale you do not have Enough jokes to be a comedy ... Strange that there are some scenes that look like an unintended "ghost" movie, however, one should give him credit for being able to control some of the Japanese teenager's feeling. <br /> <br /> I feel that by watching this movie, there may be some movies that should come with a warning sticker saying "This movie may be suitable only for someone under the age of 18", will definitely be the poster of this movie . <br /> <br />
