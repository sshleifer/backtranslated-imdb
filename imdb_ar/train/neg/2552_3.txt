This is a documentary film, it is not, it was filmed as a documentary film, but I think it was just because they then moved away with a shaky camera and a dodgy picture. This has just been released in the UK on a DVD as "American Pie Style Comedy", it is not. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film follows a group of teenagers on a spring break while they are going to Mexico to get cheap wine and with the quest to get there Virgin finally laid a friend. Throwing is a couple of dwarves, and on the same kind of research and you have an unfavorable story of drunk teens trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Given the 18 ratings, this nudity is very few, in practice there are no sexual scenes, I think evaluation is the section where there is so much. <br /> <br /> If you love raw Jackass's behavior without humor, this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then I'd probably avoid this!
