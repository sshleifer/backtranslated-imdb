What a waste of time! I have tried to sit across "Sky Captain .." about 6 times, and every time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - nothing else! It is a completely boring film, terrible representation, bland writing, obviously a first-time director, because it is harsh. I wanted to love him, I love science fiction and the old masters, and I can appreciate trying gestures to Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God I was working at Paramount Pictures, and Chery Lansing wrote in 1993 about using the blue screen screen screen, They have no interest or need to do so, and after 10 years, Paramount has released Chery was right in 1993, but she had to forget her own advice when she lit the green light on this dog. The blue screen is an impressive shot, but not a full movie. Let's not forget, neither Jod nor Jolie are great actors (but it's easy on the eyes.) The performance of Paltrow reminds me of high school Ed, but only under a skillful manager, the funny thing is that Sky Captain will continue to get a job, even after the dredging. It's trade, not art!
