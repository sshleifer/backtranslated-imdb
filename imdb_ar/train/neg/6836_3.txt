Please, even if you are at your worst, refrain from watching this. <br /> <br /> I do not think if anything is fine with this movie at all. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I watched this, and I literally turned off an hour and 48 minutes of my life in the closet. Weak representation, stupid direction, a weak story and pathetic sequences - and when you combine this, you get a "double effect". Even below expectations did not materialize. <br /> <br /> I think I learned one thing - you never see Van Damme clicks. They are a waste of pure time!
