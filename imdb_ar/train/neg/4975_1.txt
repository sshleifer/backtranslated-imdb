After watching the 2004 Canadian / Icelandic / British production of Beowulf & Grendel, which I thought was gorgeous and amazing, I came close to this - the first three Beowulf films to be released this year - with concern. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the helmets with horns, I felt pain. This migration was the age of the Swedes and the Danes, not the Vikings (they came later). Even Vikings have never wore horns on their helmets (making the horns easy for your enemy to get rid of your helmet and then startle you). Then there is the Palace of Hrolfgar, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark in the sixth century. Swords and armor look like the pillars of previous films that have appeared in different historical periods. Weapons that were probably used by the Crusaders were spotted in the "Kingdom of Heaven", and there was one character practicing the sword of the Windlass Steelcrafts from Beowulf & Grendel! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was depressing and a wooden representative completely unconvincing. The biggest yoke was the bow of secret weapons, complementing the range of vision and explosive missiles, which seem to have been bought from Iraqi insurgents. The monster with special effects and his mother was on steroids so that Beowulf could not tear his arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for the bazooka! I can go on, but I will not.
