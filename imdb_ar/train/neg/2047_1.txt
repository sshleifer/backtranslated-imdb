I do not want to go here by loud, but ..... this is the worst "film" I have ever seen. The worst of the Avengers. Efficient routing, disjointed writing, and awful representation are the only constant elements all the time. Pick up a very cheap video, which looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Often the lighting looks like Sun-Gun. The sound is a bit better than one microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot goes in strange directions without foundation or subsequent decision, and the techie elements are obviously silly, and the editing looks worse than the coarse pieces. It's not bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. BTW, the package is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> Lee's Lion Gate owes me $ 4.00.
