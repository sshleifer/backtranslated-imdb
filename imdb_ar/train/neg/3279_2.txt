Hey Geez ... There are lots of other movies I want to see there ... I stumbled with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted - yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to watch this show when I was in college .. "It was a bit reckless and a bit fun and action-oriented. The show had a good heart ... The characters were nice; no one was killed or even badly hurt ... It was like a cartoon coming to life. Cut for 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story and strange performances ... almost annoying - certainly not loyal to original characters ... Everything is like a Mad TV show and lasts for over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I was talking about watching a movie. As they were thinking? As best I can say, I must be marketing products, toys, etc. All I can say is that this person dies with a quick death. It makes the original Dukes Hazard look like a play masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> I think the only new version of the TV is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
