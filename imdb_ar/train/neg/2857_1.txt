I've seen a lot of Sci-Fi Movies since I started watching them again in 2002 (my first movie was Sabretooth - which is already one of the most interesting features of Sci-Fi in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some of them are very bad, and then there are some really terrible ones. Raptor Planet is the last. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to the original Raptor Island Channel in 2004, is hardly a mess for a movie with truly awful cinematic writing and lazy writings. The effects that bring life to dinosaurs (a mix of puppets and liveliness plus CGI and stock footage from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. Gore's effects are unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a group of commandos who are traveling for some reason (I forget the reason) to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That's right people, dinosaurs are foreigners. Dinosaurs in outer space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. Human cast is taken and eaten. Now, we've found this in many of the dinosaurs and novels that have been released, but this is the first killer dinosaur film I've ever seen, where you're actually bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are some chuckles in it. One scene highlights a man being chewed by Carnor (brought to life through video footage from the original film) and then turned into a giant storm. Also, a bit of triviality, this is the scene where Stephen Bauer filmed the scene of his death from the first film. <br /> <br /> Although Raptor Island was not a good film at first, it is a masterpiece compared to its complement. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say, this was probably the worst movie Syfy has ever broadcast. It's darn near near unchangeable.
