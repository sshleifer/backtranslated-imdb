Fulci experimented with science fiction and failed. Usually in his uncanny movies, we still get a large sum, but not here. Total scenes are very funny such as when prisinors are forced to stick to the bar for 12 minutes and if they are dropped eleelectelected. The man drops and has a kind of suitability on the ground for two minutes to be lifted by his friends who were struggling to stand on the ground. The city model is clear but not bad. The final explosion is at best funny. And do not make me start in the scenes of terrible battle. <br /> <br /> 4/10
