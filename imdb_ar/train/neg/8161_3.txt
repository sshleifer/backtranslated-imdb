Mary Lo is a slut who seeks her soul to avenge those who allowed her to return to her fiery torment in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the film is mainly in 1986. The film is in the 80's trap of strange / stupid special effects , Including some alien-looking vibrating horses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things for people and tries to control the body of one person. Whether successful or not, you'll have to watch it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty boring and is based on a bunch of worthless characters. This is also not a supplement, the only thing common with the first is the name of high school. It has an average. Horror flick drops their backs, Gore, useless nudity, knocks against the Catholic Church. The basic stuff, the boring film. <br /> <br /> The representation is adequate enough to give him 3 out of 10. You can waste time doing something else.
