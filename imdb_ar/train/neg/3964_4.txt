Despite all the fuss about this film, I was still open in the end. Although sometimes slow sometimes, only the first 90% of the film is very good, with more than a few concerns of "old time" that makes one fast and unstable. In fact, I thought cinematography was excellent for many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains failed, however, is at its peak. The end of the film and the cancellation appear to be the MILES APART of his body. The whole story lies on her face with an illogical conclusion and the answer I was seeking was something more - what really happened to Emma? - Not clarified! The rationale for negative energy was ridiculous at best, and in the end I felt very cheated. What could have been a terrifying horror film was haunting him at the end of an awful end.
