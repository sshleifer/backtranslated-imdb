This is a very cool film. It is illogical to start making some sort of strange inner logic on its own. Well, it will be so if you do not continue to fall into the side alleys until you finally flounder under the weight of her neutrality. The film can not decide whether the movie "Man turns to the beast" straight forward (like all the films of the 1950s of the last century "Incredible") story of the connection of the Hereafter, or ... or what? Make a selection. It's just a mess. Smoothly above the top and shooting in all directions, leaving loose limbs fluttering everywhere. It was as if Toby Hooper was eating David Lynch tablets. Unfortunately did not take enough.
