The potential potential film, which was set during the 19th century, failed to produce it. With prominent actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and others, there was no reason for the film to fail. However, the film lacked its end, and he had a sorry excuse for the plot line, and fell on a piece with his continuity. The typical story of a rich girl and poor boy, collected by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and dissatisfaction, has an influential side of early mother's death and absent father. The father, played by Vinnie, is a troubled man, tormenting his daughter in life and dying. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying under their social status. The actors tried unsuccessfully to save the rest of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, a waste of precious time for those who watch sadly. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, just for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, and stay away from Washington Square.
