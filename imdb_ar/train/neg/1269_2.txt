This series gets only two stars because it puts some Dickens' Bleak House movies and someone might read the book. Contrary to what was received, Diana Reig was poor, like Mrs. Didlock. They were chunky and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot Error, Error, Error for Mr. Jarndyce. So I will interrupt myself and answer all the people who say, "I have not read the book, so I do not have to take this man's opinion because it is based on his assessment of the book." For example, Diana Reg is bad in her role due to poor representation whether I read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is Jarndyce acceptable (although very old). The serial failure is not because it is not comparable to the book, but because different lines and graphic characters do not just combine to provide consistent, mysterious and fast entertainment. It's dull and flat. If you want to make Bleak House well, you will need to spend 20 hours of films in 10 episodes of two hours each. But I suggest that producers leave Dickens alone (even Carol Christmas). Dixon's genius television was also manifested in his ingenious plots and memorable characters.
