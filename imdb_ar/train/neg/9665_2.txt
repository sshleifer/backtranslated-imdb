interesting? barely. The film's "scientific evidence" of its point of view (essentially Jews) is stupid and lame. It is almost laughable (if we do not know what happened at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine that Germans (even at that difficult time) would like or believe this film. Compare it with Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that I was a film I liked it. This is just a silly rubbish. <br /> <br /> The "best" part is a scene from M (one of my favorites at all) where (a Jew, as the announcer keeps eloquently reminding us) Lori plays a child - harassing and fighting. In the eyes of these directors, only the corrupt mind can do so. Hey. You did not know that M is Hitler's favorite film, is it? <br /> <br /> No, it's just stupid. Even for this kind of Nazi propaganda. 10/02.
