This, and unethical tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk feels disgusted by sex, these two films are warning stories about what will happen if she has sex. As a film, it has not been done well - some of the behaviors are really bad (like the "American" woman in French accent). The sudden face of the young girl from the anxiety of marriage to attention (when it seems to have had to be the opposite), the sudden aunt's realization of the young man's secret is meaningless - do not explain at all. I also did not like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was shown as a sign of her family's deviation or her tendency toward the beast. Perhaps the central idea, the idea of ​​having this "exciting monster", if you like, living in the forest, is essentially a perverted but fun story, but instead is used only as a basis for a negative negative sexual story, playing morality.
