Wow, I've seen this on T.V. As one of the "scary" films they're showing about Halloween. Is this rated G? There was nothing that made this movie scary, or worth watching. Also, others say that this is a parody, but I do not think so. To get a parody, you need something called "humor". This low-budget festival had no effect on humor, nor did it make much sense. You have basically an idiot-looking monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the tanks and killing people, I think, because you do not see the beast ever doing violence to anyone or any bloody consequences. The spinning newspaper tells you that people have been killed by a monster, so I think this is good enough. <br /> <br /> The army is brutally trying to kill the monster, which is not much bigger than the man. They have a very bad goal. Then military Fleze! Wow, did this movie make the US Army look pathetic or what? The monster, while hard to kill, does not do much beside the shuffle around it. Oh, sometimes a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was quite interesting, however, there was a completely strange problem. <br /> <br /> What is the deal with the world that Xylophone played to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand much of the dialog due to poor sound quality. Also, why does the beast carry around the funky main man for a long time? Why did not the beast go to the treasury when he had a chance? Why insisted on trying to understand the meaning of meaningless?
