Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a small role in the classic "Warriors") is the first person in society to realize that there are killer mollusks in his small town. Not just any of the mollusks, keep in mind, but the carnivorous killer is naturally larger then, its moles are transformed by toxic molluscs from waste (which still go as fast as an ordinary alloy, and this is not scary, but I go on). No one will believe him at first, but they will believe him. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Well, the deadly mollusks are located above the psychotic zombies and under Jonathan Winters directly as a mork child in the crawling factor. So the absurdity of all this is quite clear from the beginning. The flick is fairly fun, and it is a "very bad it's good" set. I appreciate that they have mentioned that this movie "mollusks": film instead of mollusks: toy children or mollusks: other white meat. It may not be worth watching more than once and forgetting it right away except playing a somewhat mysterious trivia game. Director Juan Pecker Simon has been known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K mocked well) and "Peices" (which may have been one of the worst films ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari presents Rose T & A <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Just a play trailer for this movie
