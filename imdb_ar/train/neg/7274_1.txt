"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst film ever produced, far more lame than the incompetent Plan 9 from Outer Space. "<br /> <br /> Lampoon is listed in three sections, each of which is supposed to be a spoof of the traditional film genre, but each one falls at our feet with a nasty jingle. There are clear lines of story. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good points about the film are the bare scenes, Miss Gansel and Dusenberry are a little meaty, and very nice, but managers do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround.There is none of this here. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the third part of the worst is the part that includes Ruby Bean We see Benson as a passionate young policeman who is associated with a naive old playwright who plays with you, and for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this hateful movie feel pleased with the idea that we are about to see a compensatory story of how to make a policeman The young man ideal radically changes the approach of the old police work, but there is no such luck.As we said, this film has no replacement values.It is annoying all the way up to the final fading - which runs more strained than should be continued on the screen . It seems that the filmmakers knew they had something bad and wanted to benefit from it.
