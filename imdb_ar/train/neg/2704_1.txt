I do not understand why people praise this garbage. Wrong, stupid, unreal, awful, and just about everything else. The film is a presentation of life, racism, prejudices and everything else that goes on strangely in college. This is where he failed. He has no understanding of reality. For example, <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man, stops at the security guards handcuffed and executed while the gunman runs right behind them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who steals people from the ceiling subject that was stopped and beaten by the same black man is stopped and then beaten in the style of Rodney King while the gunman was running free, and for a moment after being chased by Only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As one former reviewer pointed out, many of the 230-pound white men were beaten by many black men weighing about 160 pounds, including a 105-pound bust of the rhymes <br /> < There is another critical flaw in the film is the shallow main characters are interesting. Of frightened white people and confusion and the angry and irate black people (?). Its almost as an insult to both black and white people. I'm a white man and I know a lot of blacks and Latins who agree that this film is wrong in portraying characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively because of their race. <br /> <br /> The story I will explain now is about three characters long. One is a black athlete, the other a frightened white girl confused with her sexuality, and the third a confused and fearful white man who then blames his problems on blacks who later become Nazis in the film. They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex, rape, battles, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war and oh do not forget education. All this finally comes to a deadly shot. After returning to their boring lives and thinking about "being white is bad". Does this look like many years of your studies? I do not think so. I do not think the director went to college especially if he wanted to go through this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a really bad and bad film. If you want to see more accurate display or ethnic issues, see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of the Porkys rent college. Just avoid this mess.
