About the Child: Why did not Big Brother assume that he was hungry for a bottle or some nutrition or changing diapers? He had to shout nonstop after that for several hours without care. Definitely stupid to take a child from a safe place when he does not need it. <br /> <br /> And why was it so miraculously clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Did not any of the uprooted trees fall on the roads and prevent them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that the police at the roadblock do not follow me immediately after any young man might run into them, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> However, it was good to have a movie that children could watch safely, for change.
