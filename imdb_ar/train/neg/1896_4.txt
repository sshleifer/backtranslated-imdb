This film shows us something original. Each idea or scene (motion) can be found in many previously released movies. Fabulous Nick is quite easy here. So Patton will be quiet and evil and not good. Mr. Duvall is fine, but he has a very small part. Is Angelina, how can we define the newly recognized stardom? In general, there are so many characters, so that no one and nothing particularly detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. Too bad, do not you think?
