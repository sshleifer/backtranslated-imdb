Proof that not everything touches Tarantino turns into gold. This is definitely plastic, all the way. It is easy to see that without Quentin's intervention, this may have been sitting on the shelf for years, assuming that it has been produced in the first place. It's about a woman fascinated by death who gets a cleaning job after scenes of crime, Angela Jones is not convinced of this role, and William Baldwin is the best like Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment! All in all very poor.
