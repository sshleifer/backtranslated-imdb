First, the film was not true at all. I saw the documentary a few days ago and the film was not like him. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and this was what the film should have been about the story of a man who was treated and loved love in the end and so on. There are also a lot of scenes that were completely wrong - the scene on which he cycled on the campus occurred in his first years and not after him. In my opinion, Russell Crowe was not suitable for this part at all because he does not seem to be intelligent / individual, so he could not do it. It was wonderful to focus more on mathematics (like Pi) and not on excessive love in acting. At this level, ABM was very great in Hollywood, and was so superficial that it was not great. Personally, I think he was not crazy or paranoid and had something because people of this caliber tend to know more than we know "lesser human beings". 10/05
