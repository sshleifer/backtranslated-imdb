Guernsey (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> Maria Kraakman plays Ana, a 30-year-old woman, and discovers that her husband (Fedja van Huet) cheats her but does not. T dare to face it. She painfully avoids any confrontation with humans, her parents and her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that does not do much at all. We hardly know anything about her background or motives. Just a woman looks stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why should we the public also suffer? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up cinema after seeing this insurmountable mess. These were 90 minutes boring and very painful. I usually try to avoid wasting energy on making bad movies. I will take the beating and roll it with the punches, but in this case, there is a fair warning. How did Nanok Leopold get on the ground (in large part of the public-funded funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no text to speak. Can be compensated by a masterful film director with cinematic ideas or a slightly more attractive team. Nothing at all, just a vague concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view." The result is an insult, not a tribute to a female perspective of life. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, there is no interesting shot to be found in the entire movie. I can not think of actors who could have broadcast this film, but Johanna Ter Steege is a light (small) in the dark, if possible with such a severe lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Krakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll shoot you for three minutes, just to express sadness." Perfect treatment for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late at night, while making sure you sleep too. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
