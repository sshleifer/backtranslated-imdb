The secret is ... strikes this movie. Sorry, but she did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad disagreement on what I know, what I did last summer and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dori Barton friends on a spring break trip. The group rents a lavish house and tries to enjoy an enjoyable holiday. Then, the deaths begin. First, then the other, then another friend is killed, leading to a sad and sad climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One of the notes, that Barton is the poor man Reese Witherspoon? She looks like Reese, acts like Reese and can pass Reese in the police lineup. Maybe this is how they cast it? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair representation can not fully compensate for bad dialogue and terrible writing.
