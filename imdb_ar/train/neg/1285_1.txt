Born and raised and educated in Scotland, I was horrified by this disgusting picture of a man who was no more than a cattle thief. Worse still, the whole film thread was sex in one form or another, implicitly or verbally. To see it, one might think that Scotland in the eighteenth century was inhabited by a group of transgender and gay people. Lang was a joke working as a "young" mother at the age of 49 but Liam Nison was worse! Taking a bath in a Scottish lake is not as common as it was - but it gave them another chance to show how much sex drive we had. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
