There's one wonderful moment in * Surviving Christmas * almost makes it worth the pain: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel on the head of stupid Ben Affleck. <br /> <br /> This film presents yet another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini proving what a wonderful actor is at the time his career is resolved through acting in this film. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was composed of young and wealthy, and they thought that one should not be lonely on Christmas. (From the very beginning, there is the fundamental problem in our comment on the disbelief in this stupid film: how many people in the social status of Leder in 2004 really care one way or another whether he spends Christmas alone or with half a family or a $ 50 whore?) Storyline that Drew buys a family from spending Christmas with her, provided he pretends to be his own, ignoring all evidence contrary to all that his money did not buy the emotions he was seeking. . <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a truck driver from the outskirts of the city, Tom Falco (James Gandolfini) and his courageous wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agreed to be the Drew family, against the protests on their part. The son, Brian (Josh Zuckerman is very one-dimensional) and his daughter, Alicia (Christina Applegate with a very soft focus). Drew then spends the rest of the movie supposed to regain his youth or - something. The messages in this film are crooked and illogical like the story of dry mouth. Due to his delirium of public psychosis, Drew smiles a fake smile on his face and remains blind in denial against every insult he was supposed to buy the Falco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> Which raises the question: if Drew pushed these things. People to restore some aspects of the family passion a joy, how the psychic should be to pretend happiness between their criticism and mental pain on his existence? It is not a case of the Falco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while they are around Drew - three of the four members clearly show that they despise him. Is he so fully aware that he can not see that his money is not bought by the "family" atmosphere he instilled in belief was a fact in the first place? As with all obscene films, one wonders how the four screenwriters can be intertwined in their narcissistic dreams of appearing in a credit sequence that will overlook any aspect of reasonableness or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - has stopped there. Said Nov. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow managed to shine, proving their defeat in the midst of this mess. Kristina Applegate is a willow, cute, blond and fiery in all the right places, starkly cut Drew into small segments of the carcass for most of the film, then play it off the face and fall in love with him because the script tells her so. <br /> <br /> I will not go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider looks better at his shoulder. There is a whole new level of talent seeking in the city.
