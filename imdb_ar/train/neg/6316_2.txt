A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is an ideal example of how the left in this country did not get it. They never did. Liberalism is increasingly sliding towards political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film deals with a small star in the baseball league who decides to stop playing the ball as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. It is understood that the boy ridiculed until a group of professional athletes, led by former English Premier League star Alex English, joined his case. Not only a few of them join the cause. By the time his movement reaches its peak, the league of professional and university sports has to cancel its seasons as no one will play anymore. Just to move this review, I am ready to give them this premise. Although this will never happen in a million years, I imagine that it can happen, then go from there. <br /> <br /> I do not remember how this was done, but a kind of agreement was reached, and the boy decided to return to the game he loved in an incredibly ridiculous and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is well written, acted and directed. Even if you agree with the boy's attitude, it will be impossible to overcome the mismanagement of the film. This is a shame because there are so many good actors that are lost. (Beck, Curtis, Peterson). Alex English works well with his character, and I hope he tries to act in more films. Unfortunately, very likely to find work in the world of training in the NBA. One would like to teach Mr. English more kinds of NBA thugs today about how to shoot the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball in the ring. <br /> <br /> As far as the film's message is concerned, it is not true. Clear and simple. All those nuclear warheads are tucked into the silos of those rockets westward. This would be one thing for this boy and his horse to protest against actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. In fact these weapons were never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. Neither side during the Cold War was crazy enough to launch a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what might happen between the United States and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the makers of this film aim to have children in America look their case and follow Chuck's steps. However, children in America are smarter than the left-wing chefs who invented this cable car. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a wonderful film about the dangers of nuclear war, stick to Dr Strangelov instead. </ P> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
