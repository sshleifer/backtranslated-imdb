The world may be over. Unfortunately, this film survived as further evidence of Canada's inability to produce films beyond what is impressive. Maybe that's because all the good people (Norman Jason, Martin Short, and others) go to Hollywood.) Maybe he gave her some credibility. The Canadian government must be aware --- this film is a wonderful example --- that spending money into a trough does not lead to good cinema. If people who exploit these public funds have to compete, they may have to come up with something worthwhile. They are also produced after another critical snickering.
