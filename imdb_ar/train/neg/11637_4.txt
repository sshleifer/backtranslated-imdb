Uwe Boll has done the impossible: creating a game modification that remains at least somewhat true in the game; it has turned a game full of anti-social content and attack into a film full of anti-social content and attack. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Uwe Boll is still dealing with him here, so do not expect the movie to be really good. Although the time has come, "Postal" wears a quick welcome and becomes a pain in his way. <br /> <br /> In essence, Postal is a satire in the United States, as happened by twelve year olds. Paul seems to believe that insult is linearly commensurate with comedic value: the more aggressive, entertaining and exaggerated it is. This film produces new levels of taste while beating and failing. Yes, some gags work but they seem lucky. Points of interest include the manager, who brags himself, and people are severely beaten by trucks and other vehicles. The low points included .. also pretty much everything. <br /> <br /> After being surprised by the initial surprise, "mail" became a tedium to watch it. Yes, there is a good joke every ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters who shoot and chase each other everywhere for what seems to be forever. <br /> <br /> This is likely to have worked as a short film, but it is not just sufficient content for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (although it seems twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice attempts, but they are hopelessly lost in endless and meaningless scenes and content that are offensive just because they are 4/10
