Like many Orson Welles thirty years ago, Mike Sarne was given "the world's largest train" to play with, but unfortunately he lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his own train set that became the wreck of a train still talking about him with a shock and a strange kind of horror . Despite the postmodern interpretations that somehow claim to be considered gay or even feminist, the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and still one today. How anyone can look at the resources available to Mr. Sarn to have spread The family king remains very secret, where Michael Semeno was close to Armageddon's political and artistic "Gate of Paradise". Both films seemed to be the ego journeys of the directors, but at least Mr. Simino had been one of the greatest films of the 1970s before the studio's lavishness, while Sarn had only "Joanna" in his wardrobe. Furthermore, Heaven's Gate can boast some memorable and well-processed pieces, where the Myra Breckinridge closet was exposed. Simply put, it is often the worst example of a biting hand that feeds on the history of Hollywood.
