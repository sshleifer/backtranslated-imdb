At least I was able to enjoy the irony of the film which is surprising because I could hardly sit in it. In all honesty, my guess is that the cost of a DVD case is greater than the cost of the entire movie. And say that this is the same director for The Boogeyman, when a new version of this release was just released ... guys nice touch, it was misleading enough to love me. The only thing that frustrated me more than just unbearable behavior was the copycat story of his hair. Usually you see this kind of hair only on a boy of ten years and acting personal as such. The film appears to have been filmed by a D + classmate from a film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes ... Sometimes, friends are less numerous. By going out I will be lost through random fluctuations that have led to nowhere or have not been explained. All this makes a bad film, but when the end does not come close to bringing it together, it makes it a very bad film. This is undoubtedly the worst film I have ever seen, including the final French video of my friends in the first year of high school, but I may be a little biased, meaning I got extra play. Note I do not think this is worth a star ... nor even half. Nothing for you!
