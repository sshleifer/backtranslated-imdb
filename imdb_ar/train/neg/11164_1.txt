What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This film seems to be trying to copy a "sophisticated" comedy but the direction and the screenplay were sloppy, deadly and emotional in the worst cinematic tradition. The role / representation of Jack Black was tolerant of himself ... while the other characters were just as unmoved. The soundtrack was boring. We (WERE) are fans of Black, but none of us have done more than try the titter forced throughout. Why did he feel he needed to commit this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch another of his films without reading the reviews more accurately first! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read the script before subscribing to this drivel?
