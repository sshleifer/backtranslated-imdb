Really bad. Why does anyone think that this is a good film not to mention that mystery is a real mystery. I like comedy movies like the next guy and I liked the "Christmas Story". The fact that he has the same director and based on the memoirs of the writer himself has made me quite puzzled by why this film failed completely on every level. Charles Groden misrepresents a father as a beginner. For another, it does not seem to have the same speed - it does not flow well. Everything seems tired and cruel. The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here - just want the film to end. I do not even recommend this movie to curious people who enjoyed the Christmas Story. It's so bad. 10/01.
