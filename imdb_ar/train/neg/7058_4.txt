I came to NEW PORT SOUTH I expect an alternative film for the Colombian school massacre like the ELEPHANT of Gus Van Sant and certainly a summary in the television guide that a social rebel student against the system gave me this impression but this is a very boring film where little happens, think of warning yourself <br /> <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decided to respond to what he thought was an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is written and that the actor who plays his role Blake Shields is unable to decorate any deficiencies in the script. You have a gut feeling that Maddox must have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or bin Laden, but he never caught him as a cocky teenager and it is impossible to believe he can rally any students. Your subtext, which overthrew only one autocratic regime to replace it with another manipulation system, is very obvious, which means that New Port South is a totally unconvincing drama that does not deserve to get out of your way to see
