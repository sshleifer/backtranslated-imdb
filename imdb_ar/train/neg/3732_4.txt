Maybe because I was too young and innocent and I was shocked when I saw him, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since I was in seventh grade at the Presbyterian School, so I'm not sure what effect it will have on me now. However, I will say it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. He served his purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly horrified by what Christians who had recently converted after the rapture had to bear when they did not get the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still picture them in my head ... It's been 19 years.
