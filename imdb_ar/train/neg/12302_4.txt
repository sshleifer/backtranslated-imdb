Participated in a joint American / Italian production starring Linda Blair and David "The Huff" Hasslehoff: How can a fan of cruel horror resist such treatment? <br /> <br /> Well, based on the hard and strained calm, the first forty minutes completely meaningless or so, you will say "very easily"; Fortunately, however, things eventually get a boy more fun With the introduction of many innovative death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an unbroken version, full of nudity as well (unfortunately, my version was visually edited to remove these offensive material). <br /> <br /> Huff starred as Gary, the photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Kamming) to a dilapidated hotel on an apparently deserted island to take pictures of her latest project, a book about magicians. While there, my distraught Gary also hopes to try to cure a bad blue ball by relieving Leslie of her virginity. <br /> <br /> His plans for the Naukee have been canceled, but due to unexpected arrival of property developers Freddy and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross) and their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair) and his son Tommy (Michael Manchester) and the beautiful architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Shekland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect the island hotel. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gari and Lizley were greeted by new property owners. When a violent storm suddenly picks up, making the return to the mainland precarious, he agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, without the knowledge of the new hotel guests, the place is also home to the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), which requires human sacrifice to bring life back to itself. One by one, the victims are pulled into a spiral red spiral (which ensures unintended laughter), before facing a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of this is logical, and the behavior is terrible (Manchester, since Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasslehoff has proved to be one of the best artists who talk about others, but those viewers who have passed the gloomy first half are rewarded with some She was tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish (!!); Freddy's veins burst into the bloodstream and Gary was stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, Leslie is being raped by a man without lips and Blair gets (again).
