The movie "Avent-garde nightmare", a very low budget contains the delusions of grandeur. Difficult to sit through. I received a message that child abuse was wrong. Wow great revelation. I had no idea that it was a mistake before displaying this. Yes, that's a joke. You do not see this "movie" if you feel insulted by the male or female sex. Do not see it if you are a little less heat. You do not see it if you're interested in acting. In the second thought, do not just see it. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Making the Film, Premiere, Interview with Kristie Bowersock, Deleted Scenes, Film Snapshots, Director's Comment, Two Copies of the Promoted Video, Section A music video from The Azoic, and a video experience for the class
