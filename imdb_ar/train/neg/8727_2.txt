Let me begin by saying that I can only enjoy any Italian horror film or the same exploitation that I missed in the 1970s. seriously. This was a totally awful one. <br /> <br /> There are many items that Martino tries to pump and none of them (except for a crocodile) works well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, who have set up a resort in the forest somewhere. I do not remember where it happens ... how sad it is ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this original tribe and "its ceremonies but they eventually angered the" crocodile god "of the river which proceeds to go in a state of agitation, Well, do not raise your hopes, there is no minimum violence to the end, special effects are very bad, as if a kindergarten student were performing them, and the love story that was thrown on them is funny. > I climbed an underwater camera in a swimming pool and threw the crocodile into the game, like darts, in the water, and this laxity is supposed to be attacking. In another special effect, the match truck is targeted by the amazing plastic crocodile, which is about five times the size of the car. (A few minutes ago, it was just big enough to eat a human being, but now dwarfing a full-size truck. The only other point I can think of where the very bad effects were pulled from the story is Bruno Matte's masterpiece, Rats, with the presence of plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who are afraid. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would say that anything Sergio Martino was a must, but this is a must. A waste of time and definitely not worth buying at a sticker price of $ 15 from no shame. This one is SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
