The only aspect of this film that saves me from being my least favorite celluloid piece of junk is a single line spoken by an agent trying to sneak into the tomato that a man eats by wearing a tomato uniform: "Can someone cross ketchup?" I strongly urge anyone with a sleep disorder to use this movie as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.
