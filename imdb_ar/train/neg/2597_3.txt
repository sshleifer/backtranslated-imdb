Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through a bad period, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After being a child prodigy, she descended into obscurity with modest quality movies. Although she recovered from this dark past, this film remains a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting hypothesis, reminiscent of Brian De Palma, "Raising Cain"; with a conspiracy dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story of horror / suspense. Barrymore plays the role of Holly Gooding, a young woman trying to live a new life in California after a traumatic event from her past that her other character caused her mother to kill. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past comes back to haunt her as her evil character returns to her life ready to destroy her new peace and her new love. In the midst of chaos, his new friend Patrick Haysmith (George Newburn) will try to help Holly face the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike the thrilling De Palma, "Doppelganger" is often a mediocre film that does not only serve purpose, but ends with one of the worst ends of the film's history. While Barrymore is certainly not at its best, she has managed to maintain her dignity by performing above average. But the rest of the cast ranged from mediocre performance to painfully bad performances, although Leslie Hop was among the best. <br /> <br /> The text is full of clich√©s and de Palma's effect is quite clear. While the film tries to be original by working literary references on almost every line, the dialog boxes are dim and the woodwork is certainly not working well. Have a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are already among the few goodies in the film. However, the excessive use of exotic effects at the end of the context completely reduces the impact of KNB's works and makes what is amazing in a different film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is B Movie is not an excuse for its low quality, as with a better and more coherent scenario, this may be an interesting film. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre movie getting worse every second. Worth the beauty of Barrymore. 10/03
