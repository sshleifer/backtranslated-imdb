Most college students find themselves lost in the academic bubble, isolated from the communities in which they study and live. Talks with fellow students and faculty members. The Steven Greenstreet documentary is a prime example of a disappointed college student who rules the whole community on limited contact with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focused on a small group of people filmed as representing large populations. As usual, people who scream more often get media attention. Unlike the distortion of the society in which the film was screened, the documentary was well presented. My only concern is that the emotions and noise shown in the film are attributed to the entire community rather than to the few individuals who have expressed them. <br /> <br /> It is natural to study such debate and make people aware of the differences between political views, but it is absurd to engage an entire community in the work of some extremists.
