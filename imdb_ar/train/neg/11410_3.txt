Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in portraying him as Gideon. The film could have been classic if Lambert and Tom Hanks in Forest Gump, Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babette in Ryan, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson at I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the storyline is meaningful to us in life, Charlton Heston, Carole O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were all excellent. 3 of 10.
