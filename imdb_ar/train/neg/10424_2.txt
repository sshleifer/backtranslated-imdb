I must love this movie. The acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic but the film always seemed very vulgar to me. The film makes working-class people look low and cheap. The fact that her daughter is ashamed of her mother and that her daughter does not rise above her made me feel uncomfortable all the time. Barbara Stanwyck While the mother worshiped the daughter, but her daughter forgot to love the mother to find happiness with her to do the family of parents. I wonder how many people who watched this movie feel this way about it. The acting was very good and worth watching. I really do not like the story line. Just a personal preference. Thank you
