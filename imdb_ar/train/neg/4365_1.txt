Ariona Albright is a really good actress, but why I participated in this lame written farce is a mystery. What could have been an amusing wind as classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariona is that she can behave in the same way as her real-life partner Lillie Stubbs, but she obviously spent the money for a spa or beauty school. This was a production he shouted for some T & A with a creative scriptwriter who could have achieved that in the flow of things. But Ariona does what she can under these circumstances and to a certain extent saves her reputation. Tempe should be aware that when two women are pulled in the costume of a frantic fetish cop, viewers expect some pagan play & T & A. Nough.
