Despite the excellent acting, it is a wonderful film, especially from the aviation perspective. It might be a bit better than Von Richthofen and Brown, but not so much. Blue Max is still the best in a small market over the past 35 years, while Darling Lilli is fun if it is not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate on what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in the new and high-quality WW I aero film.
