I could not stop laughing !! This movie is very funny and stupid! But, I do not mind, it's very entertaining! In this movie, you do not need to pay attention to anything! Representation is the same - lame! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I can see the stick carrying the T-Rex head for a moment.) The birds of prey are the same from Carnosaur 2, T-Rex are the same, but ... Of the failure of the project of kindergartens. The work is quick, sometimes very fast, and in fact I talk about quick editing, they have released it very quickly, so we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! To late, they are rubber! Well, the only interesting things here are seeing Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not hire it ... Watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
