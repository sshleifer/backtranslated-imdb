Ugh! From where to begin ... First, Campbell Scott's anxiety, which does not stop at a real starting point after a short period (a very short period), becomes increasingly absorbed by his growing pain, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters as presented by the writer and director are completely undesirable, and here lies the key. They did not give us anything to care about whether they were adulterers and whether they were still in love with each other or not. When Scott quietly told his wife, "I can kill you," before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his bad timing had fallen selfishly, I wished he had done it - and then he did the same thing with the laugh, the wise appearance of Dennis Leary before he was moved From a chromatic box. A complete waste of time and perhaps - perhaps just - resources.
