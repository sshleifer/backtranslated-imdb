The director, who was chained and leathery, warned the audience at SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we were about to watch the movie "Experimental". experimental? Leave the camcorder on the rear seat of the car, and allow to roll the tape and release at each point of contamination is meaningless within the sight. A winding winding road starts anywhere and the audience does not take a place. The unjustified violence that opens the film has led more than one patron from Castro's theater. I was leaving, too, but my friend at work needed a trip home and had this thing about seeing the worst thing to the end. By the time the spotlight was on, the public was very weak. A lukewarm applause. Formal questions for the director who seemed pleased with the product. Avoid this movie!
