Three writers made a bold attempt to adapt Jean Stanton Hitchcock's novel for the tube, but in the end this TV movie was injected with a lot of melodrama and just did not know when to stop. Maggie Tilly herself suddenly finds herself employed by the mysterious wealthy Ellen Burstein, who wants to paint a mural on the walls of her unused dance floor. After learning about the last gathering there - the party of the daughter of Elaine - Tilly decides her artistic subject, and never dreamed that the girl died in mysterious circumstances before the job began, and she and death bear a striking resemblance to the other. ! Two outstanding representatives have provided their services to exquisite yarns that do not bear much scrutiny, one of which does not match any woman in the intensity of emotion. Bersten's role swings in the camp, while Tilly stumbles in the performance of the dreaming waif routine. There is only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the wall) charged with a sense of sincerity, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
