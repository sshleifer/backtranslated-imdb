I admire this series and read all seven books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the people who should watch this are the people who have already read the series and have curiosity about it. It's too bad and will stop reading them. It does not mean that, but Lucy is so ugly that she detracts from the film. Was she the daughter of the directors? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the film were jealous of her teeth. She had a bite that would put any beaver to shame. The film loses a lot in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> There's one thing they did correctly! Aslan! very good work. Although other human actors with painted faces (beavers, the wolf) look silly, Aslan was good because he was not just a walking human actor. (I think such an old fantasy horse? Two people inside?) Also, I will be curious about what the children think of this film. Maybe they will enjoy it? But for adults, they will not bet safely, even if they are CS fans.
