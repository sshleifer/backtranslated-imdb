"Magnolia" is a lively and puzzling effect and adds up to very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a series of aimless rings with no interest in coherence. The camera flips through the corridors and corridors, picking up a glimpse of the sad characters. Where is the reason to take care of these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot, and who can not care about others (except the characters of John C. Riley and Philip Seymour Hoffman), who are self-destructive, scattered or killed. I remembered how much she hated "shine" because of the irreparable beast of Ermin Mueller Stahl's father. There are a lot of people who are not attractive and unattractive here, so why do we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said that, there is nothing about Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson's thoughts are scattered on his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both occur in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has a camera flips from one character to another while each one sings one of the popular songs of Amy Man Cafe. Sweet, but ineffective because we can not see what is threading them all together. I can not reveal the other idea that I have mentioned other than to say that it is unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a great deal of representation. Tom Cruise in particular who unleashed the performance I did not know he was in. John C. Riley played the role of the most fit and good cop in modern memory. But that adds nothing. When this unexpected secret event occurred, the girl behind me was no longer in the theater, saying, "That's stupid!" My feeling is that most filmmakers will agree.
