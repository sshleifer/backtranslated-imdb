This film proves that you can not judge a movie through the wonderful artwork on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about the movie before you buy it (or get it for someone on Christmas). The beginning of this film actually looks rather promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old man from the bottom of the street) gives the mixed school a book full of magical spells that he leaves in their annual haunted house (where the film takes place). Then there is some drinking, fighting, porn soft core. After that, the film is finally made after more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hallow's End was predictable and unpretentious and reminds us of a soft pornographic content. It's best to watch this movie with a group of friends who do not have a lot to do, because it's a good movie to make fun of. For the first time viewers, it is really interesting to make predictions about the order of people who die.
