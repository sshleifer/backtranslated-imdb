Let's hope this is the ultimate nightmare. This is an example of something good that went bad. Well, there is still some fun to enjoy, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talayay was there throughout this franchise, and was in the production team and even produced. I do not know what she was thinking about, but this disaster comes complete with a human video game boy and a guest appearance by <br /> <br /> Tom and Rosen Arnold! I wish I had the slightest idea what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of trash. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than a glamor, rather than a resemblance to horror, with the contrasting use of the three-dimensional end. Are not those glasses stylish? And you get to keep it! It's an equivalent, I spent about $ 9.00 here from me 10 cents. Now, do not you feel special? Sorry, but for me, it did not make me feel private. <br /> <br /> Freddy had another face-lift. This was the worst, I think. All the fine arts that have appeared in his "look" in previous films have been replaced by a group of artificial limbs cheaper costably. It is like ... the victim of burns that is supposed to be on it, and more like a skin disorder. The change of lead composition like this to date is to the same chain as the main representative change. But wait! They did, and they did. So I think it does not matter. But it's important to me. Freddy is no longer scary. It's just ... another low lease monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It is ... a darker comedy than the classic horror of this series; full of what you can only hope the book thought was clever and cleverly clever (unfortunately, it was short in both accounts) ). <br /> <br /> So, there is nothing I can say except grab a popcorn and prepare for laughter, because there was not a scary or impressive moment in this entire movie. <br /> <br /> Assessing 3.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The villain :.
