This film is, despite its "independent" status, a stupid Hollywood version of the relationship between mother and daughter. It was not bad at first, but somewhere during the movie - soon his daughter's exit with this man, I think - turns into a link between mother and daughter. I'm sorry, but I do not know which of the mothers who have this kind of relationship with their daughter ... may be better this way.
