I caught this on the IFC yesterday, and I can not believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were nothing but? She told Kate Good that she could be expelled because she was supposed to be a pillar of society, but she was putting him down! Then they suddenly decided that they are in love? And was severely destroyed because of his death, did not go to his funeral, much less, and told his family "good news"! By the way, how did the American become the head of an appropriate British school? Janine was supposed to go out of power because of her unforgivable abuse of power, but nothing happens! It ended up being a con con I brought for questioning! To say the least about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel more than good, please! It's a mistake the same villain's curse turned into a pimp! Where is the guilt on poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If I could just do the same thing with the bozos behind this "movie"!
