Charles stroll is appropriate but this performance is very low. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a sub-plot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets development and hurts the film a bit. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wanted to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" was so bad.
