I'm not sure what. I just can not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want to be tight about it. But seriously I could not laugh at this film. It was not funny to me. Some parts like Ben Stiller and Jack Black seemed to be trying hard. Just because you put two very funny men does not mean that this would be an excellent comedy. Some movies just should not be made. This is one of them. Because he does a lot of old jokes and his acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Kind of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give this anything less than two. That's all I do. <br /> <br /> 2/10
