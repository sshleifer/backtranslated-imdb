Overpriced and only for those in their twenties who wear special glasses with a thick rose color, who never saw them in the first place because they were young. Awesome animation, dialogue and tired narrative. A real product in the 1980s, a gimmick for the TOY puzzle game (that's right, not a tinker toy, a buzz and a kid who avoids the "Amateur Collector Statue") and is sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other gadgets, only those who bought TOY when They were "real" children from "84" to "87". It has become a cult because these adults are themselves immature to give up their memory. Avoid.
