You really, really disappointed with this movie. It started really well, and he designed a wonderful and interesting atmosphere, but when it finally came to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out that he was just a person myself suffering from skin problems ... ... again. Daisy de Du. After another nutjob movie ... as if we did not have enough of them already. <br /> <br /> To be fair, "crawling" really bothers you to look at it, the way it moves and the strange sounds it makes crawling, but I am fed up with renting such a movie only to discover that the monster is human, albeit a twisted and violent film. When I saw all the malignant rats early I was hoping for a hybrid kind of horrible and a fragile beast ... this was wrong when crawling was detected. <br /> <br /> Moreover, some of the things in this film are meaningless. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell kills a security guard? What's the point, apart from sticking to a great soundtrack saying "Hello, I'm myself and I live here!" It is stupid, and it seems to be happening only to prevent Franka Potenti from getting help. <br /> <br /> What the hell was he eating there? I got the impression that he was effectively surrounded, and the unexpected opening in the tunnel section only allowed him to leave ... Did he chew mice all the time, and if so, why would they walk around him a lot? Why is the curse hard to kill? It is weak, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance ... but it seems to continue despite injuries that are equivalent to those that paralyze non-psychic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> A DVD comment says that we aim to sympathize with a creep, but I just find it hateful. It's an effective enough movie, but it missed a lot of opportunities that made me feel sick.
