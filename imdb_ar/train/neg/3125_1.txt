Boris Karloff is Matthias Mortifal, an old goose who dies and lives in the Maureng Palace with some servants and tells his friend the doctor: "Do not try to get me doctor! He calls his daughters and sisters home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness to "shrink the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Mortifal / Karlov dies , And the deadly "Games" (designed by his dead brother) began to kill relatives. A small gun fires real bullets at the men's face, and a life-size cavalry in armor attacks with an ax and a beard stabs people with a knife. One man getting choked makes some faces hilarious. In the end, Golisa and her friend found that Karlov was still alive and hiding in the cell where the steel gates closed the room. He plays the frequent music of the members (such as the rattle used in the killings), and the spirit of the brother begins to speak ("The whole house will go with me!") And the palace burns in flames. <br /> <br /> This senseless mess is very dark and tedious and the stupid dialogue never matches lips.
