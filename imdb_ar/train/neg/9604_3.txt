The first thing I noticed in this film of course, is the amount of unnecessary nudity. It is not naked or anything, but much was not necessary. Anik Borel plays the role of a troubled woman who believes that her ghostly family shows that her horrifyingly terrified grandfather was starved and believed their fate might be the same. He actually found it very interesting. The original Wolf Man was supposed to be a completely psychological film, but Universal delivered the actual Wolf Man that you should never have seen for an extra or two. I find that this concept for someone is not really interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that it is not a wolf from the beginning, so there is no suspense or misrepresentation, as they are trying to make the movie look like a script has already happened. They failed to add one or two parts of the film in reference to this reality. At first I was excited to read the description of the film. But I slowly realized that it was just a cover so they could expose the main characters in the breasts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Anik Borrell is either a good actor who plays a great psychic role or a really bad actor plays a psychotic role. Since Danniele has no brains, just a nut that revolves around madness and snoring and picks up like a wolf, it takes little skill. She had moments when her performance penetrated for a moment crawling but was soon ruined by the poor work of the camera and light. The idea is wonderful, but it was performed horribly throughout the film. 10/03
