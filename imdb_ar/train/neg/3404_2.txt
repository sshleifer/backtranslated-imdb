I will not bring this film with all the countless technical techniques that will take two days to illustrate how the whole thing is not remotely possible. Others have pointed out all the absurdities already relevant. <br /> <br /> In view of all this, I can still enjoy it, if it includes not only all the accents, nausea, anger, and dyskinesic emotional nonsense, which is misplaced anywhere, but nowhere more than space , Where the smallest error can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The "crew", in addition to the "real" astronaut, were equally guilty of placing all this nonsense above all else. It has completely destroyed any value the production may have left. <br /> <br /> It surprised me that NASA left this garbage so many people get a lot of misinformation about something important to them. If you have not seen this yet, save yourself from wrath. Watch Apollo 13 again. At least try to be real.
