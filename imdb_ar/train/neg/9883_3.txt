Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek looks 16 years old at good and sometimes becomes naked. She does a very good job playing an immortal 16-year-old beauty that is immature and insecure, in fact. <br /> <br /> 2) Many beautiful Greek island shots <br /> <br /> But: /> 1) Peter Hooten becomes the actor's worst performance since Brutus played a friend of Caesar in the Proceedings of the Roman Senate on 15 March. He delivers every line in a delicious baritone baffle. Lower the volume whenever it occurs. Preferably to be along the way <br /> <br /> 2) I imagined Bo in tame unfortunately, especially according to today's standards. Some turns in the bathroom and a fully clad pattern <br /> <br /> 3) The plot has become a Bo costume
