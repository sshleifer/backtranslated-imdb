I do not tend at times ... trying, trying and trying to be charitable towards all the B grade thru Z movies that are there, but once while testing a particular movie you are impatient to want to slap all concerned. "Bat People" (which I saw under "It Lives By Night") is just such a film. You can not see this without thinking that it should have been a ring at the Night Gallery, and not one of the best ones too. <br /> <br /> The movie has to do with the doctor who bites the bats, and thus begins to turn into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (In fact, you think that if it turns into a real bat, it may eat mosquitoes next to the gallon bucket, but because this horror film is rich and cheap, the blood is the word.) Despite the fact that it has seizures when the hat falls, Almost every night, his friend and fellow doctor, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Xtreme, insist that he is suffering only from an "allergic reaction" to rabies shots. Meanwhile, the district mayor suspected the most repulsive and modeling in the world that the document is responsible for the brutal killing and exposure of many local girls (and one wine). At the same time, the doctor's wife decides that deprivation is a river in Egypt and alternately alternates and leads to distraction. <br /> <br /> It is not so much that acting is bad - you can say that actors make choices at the professional level, and try to bring some juice and life to the text, even the man who plays the role of sheriff. (Well, it's very bad, but it's bad in a clichehed, woody and professional way). It's just all about representation, the way the viewer is presented, the fashion, the dialog box, the text, and the storyline in general, you put your teeth on the brink and you want to slap all the participants. <br /> <br /> I think the film had an opportunity to be a favorite of the scary little nervousness, but: The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, the experienced character actor, with a chair Pataki even agreed to ACT, not just Denis Weaver's channel. <br /> <br /> 2) I also needed to find a more logical script for the entire "Bat Bites Human" scenario, which then turns into A Bat. <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who acted as a doctor to find a more reasonable part of the theatrical works because of his "episodes," instead of resorting to the "Man Who Has Forfeited" page from The Little, Acting behavior. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to rework the whole "wife" character, make her smarter, less courageous and waaaaay more observant. <br /> <br /> I will never see this movie again, except with the help of Mike and the bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a silly, funny or interesting way. Still better than the "battlefield" or "water world".
