I liked the first film, but this is an example of a textbook to complement that would have been better left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film, if not great, was at least interesting. This supplement attempts to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Whelken is still as good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a little silly. If you have not seen any of these movies, then you've got the first movie and forgotten the clips, they can pull all the joy out of the original.
