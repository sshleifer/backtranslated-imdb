Great Western I hear everything that says! Great first effort! Well, I'm not sure which film I've all seen but it should be different from the movie I saw. Great Westerners or actually good movies of any kind have personalities you can trust and nothing for this movie! The acting was weak at the very least, and I did not care much about any of the characters, which made the entire film meaningless. The story was too big for manufacturers, and they might have to try putting the low-budget trash directly into the TV as you see in the FACT OR FICTION programs on science fiction. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, great Western or even just an hour and a half enjoyable, please look elsewhere.
