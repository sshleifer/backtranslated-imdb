If there is ever a call to produce a bad film that reflects how humanity can become stupid, this film will get the prize. This conspiracy is centered around Bible prophecies, which lie in the hidden messages of writings that push a group of power thugs to try to take full control of the world. How stupid is this writer to believe that people are already? <br /> <br /> The acting was bad at best. Casper Van Dyne wasted his talent in doing this film. Michael York's work was fair for this role, because he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> The plot was very disturbing and disturbing. Mature or immature minds should not see this film. This is how the conspiracy of good versus evil can be run out. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness floating around movie circles, who are looking for ways to market this kind of waste. There must be something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
