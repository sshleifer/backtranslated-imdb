As a former teacher (!) I must admit to seeing many scenes - although I continued to watch until the end. I wonder why? (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes surprised me as not unreasonably shaky and unfocused. The plot, too, despite the existence of some good ideas - the plight of the relief teacher, for example - has not concentrated enough in any one direction to develop three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr. Nolty's finest moments. For Mr. Macchio the young man, do you speak that way in * every movie *? <br /> <br /> The complaints were planned and set aside, hairdressing alone was a nostalgic (if nauseous) journey. <br /> </ strong>
