I have read some positive reviews of this film, and I was really surprised at the amount of the whole thing. Because this film intersects an AIDS-related story and a kind of "Blithe Spirit," this film can not always make it take into account what it wants. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark gay couple have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants to. Mark is HIV-positive and he and Simon do not seem to have sex anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who used to stop his feelings after his father refused years ago - tries to erase his memory and move on to get a bachelor's degree. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark comes back in a ghostly fashion and frustrates his various attempts, while Simon drives open and acknowledges his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is like a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any sympathy towards him because of most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it is too late to pay attention. Mark, on the other hand, follows the footsteps of Demi Moore of "The Ghost", by crying profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a strange switch in Tone after Mark's return. Suddenly we got some lame attempts at humor, a "famous" television show but that does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes more volatile, with amateur attempts to anger your heart. Conclusion, with a gold-plated muscular boy's angel directs the sign of tears to paradise while Simon's tormented goodbye and sad-bye is a cocky thing, mainly due to the fact that it is not deliberately hilarious.
