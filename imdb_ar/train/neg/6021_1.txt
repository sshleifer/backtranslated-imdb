I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this film. Amazing misconduct, terrible scripting and effects that you can make on your normal computer, incredible plot inconsistencies ... Reporter can get an inexperienced hostess and a key function at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so exhilarating that you came out and you feel as if you tried to hit you upside down full size. All that this film will do will preach the choir and make everyone laugh at such absurd waste of money. If filmmakers really wanted to influence people to Christianity and show what faith really meant, they would have used the money to really help those in need. Now, / this may have / has affected some people in actually listening to them.
