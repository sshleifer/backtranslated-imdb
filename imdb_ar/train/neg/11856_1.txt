I watched this film last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, and it makes me seriously wonder whether the people at the festival are actually screening the films before they were selected. The film was simply shocking - I say that without too much motivation or ulterior motive - the film was awful. The days of Matthew Moden as a prominent man ended. Gina Gershon wore an unexplainable English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Rubin was a strange little veil - you should also be ashamed. The script was terrible and did not give us any reason at all to care for the characters. I strongly doubt that this will be picked up, but again, it is known that people in Hollywood make mistakes sometimes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious competitor to the worst film I've ever seen.
