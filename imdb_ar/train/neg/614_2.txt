I'm watching this on Sci-Fi now. It's so terrible I can not stop watching it! I am a video photographer and this film makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this film. Some camera work is good. Most very questionable. There are a few decent actors in the flick. It is very bad that they are surrounded by what must be the relatives of the manager. This is the only way they can be qualified to be in a movie! The music was a bit better than acting. If I can see this, I hope it is because there is no other option at all! The sequel is now (sequel yeah) .... I think I'll skip it! Jason
