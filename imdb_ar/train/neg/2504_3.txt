Having internal laws for the weekend? This is then the film that hastens their departure, and a failure to catalyze a catatonic state to bring a warm welcome to the constant annoyance. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposed to be on a luxury cruise ship, which is more a modified car ferry; this plot contains more holes than the intermediate filter and a party that has been raked from the depths of the celebrity list D. Play an interesting amusing game " Spot the Villain "as passengers join the ship. You will not be wrong! Using a script that drowns faster than bricks, the Klicheed group is putting in a lot of berry and jam, where it tries to include thrills, action films and festivals, and fail to achieve any of them at the same time. <br /> <br /> The movie should be watched, even if it laughs over how damaging it is.
