This movie is a wonderful example of how some funny jokes can make a terrible mistake. I was expecting at least something from this movie after watching the addition that was funny like hell but the movie was not good. <br /> <br /> The odd part is that the jokes are already funny, the parody ban smoking, Jo Bole ... etc, really good jokes, but I do not know who blames this movie that flops. <br /> <br /> The main candidates may be: - 1) hammers (actors)) and hammer (actresses) and not even funny type 2) director 3) the guy who cast actors and / or the director anyway if you are really really bored I really mean seeing this movie, or getting a copy of every ad or teaser from this movie and laughing at your neck because these will be more entertaining than the movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The grace of saving this only movie is Mahesh Mangarikar and Shabu Bhai
