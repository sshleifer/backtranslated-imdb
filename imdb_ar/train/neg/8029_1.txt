A friend of mine bought this (cheaply) and decided to give me a birthday present. I thought I never saw her because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic, but then my friends got bored and watched. From start to finish! I know a great achievement but it is already a masterpiece. Difficult to describe. You should see, it's a real lesson about what people can do when they think they're creative and intelligent and not. "Acting" is rugged terrain (you can actually see a "master lady" laugh at times, it's definitely the worst). "The Story" is that it is stupid to sum up and really suck everything in this film. Please, pay special attention to "Sheriff." The older man has no excuse at all to participate in this. It's very bad as well. Whatever you do have some hilarious moments. Check it out, haha
