The author of the book, with the same title, should not allow its name to be used in this film. If you have read the book, this film will take a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit so that the film and the book seem to have little in common except the title and some superficial details. The film adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to literary achievement of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. Not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it does nothing more as it moves slowly (for example, developing a character). Some viewers may be amused by some of the later graphic love scenes, but you can watch a special show time for the things they offer in Theres and Isabel - somewhat tame and not fantasy at all.
