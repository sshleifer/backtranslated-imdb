The only reason to give it number 2 is that cinematography has been simplified these days to the point that it contains at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is inappropriate. It's like a lot of 21st Century home grind feed. Unjustified and disgusting injustice. I did not care about any of the characters, but I did care that some Cretan bothered them to check this nonsense: I complained about the money I spent, but my history and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went to a nearby theater to watch the fun and entertaining "Live Free or Die Hard" Rated higher than me just because I endured the "Captivity" tube for 40 minutes.
