A clear project of the vanity of Karen Manny (Who?), As a hottie Charles Brunson revolves around the "scum" that stole her parents, grandparents or something, and admires small blocks with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene, she intervenes to stop her rape, and a police officer gives a man to jail. So, after seeing a couple of cold scenes and some of the abortive temptations of prison, she had to take the law into her hands with blah blah blah. I think there are a lot of movies like this? The script is stupider than usual if you can believe it. Mani comes with the same type of showbiz that will star in the production of her Death Wish role, and I find this genre intermittently popular, but the film is an unwanted device. Competent actors will be lost on the roles of scumbag here, and will actively undermine the fascinating DA incompetent procrastination and the judge who must have a product uncle.
