!!!!! Of course there are spoils !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a workshop to write screen about avoiding cliches in horror movies: The protagonist - Check out the bad things for drug abusers - Check that Haurin expels the villain - Check Heroine does not notice that the villain is recovering from the subconscious - See the recovered villain creeping behind the heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems that someone has sent this vulgar list to a movie studio instead of using it for class. Dear my dear if the transport in London is just as regular as the appearance of cliches here. In fact, there are a lot of cliches and we saw them moments ago so no one thought of going into details about what a crawl had to do with the name or duration of killing people on the ground. It has led to the belief that it is the result of some human experience, and perhaps that night did not decide to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that it is meaningless and not completely negative and I doubt very much in the producers thought they would produce a film that would have won the Oscars that year, Always a market for horror movies. Similarly, I doubt whether the cost of production is too large and was one eye in the DVD market rather than the distribution of the cinema, and I will mention it a little better than the DEATH LINE of 1972 which also showed an eccentric cannibal hideout in the London Underground. When you think that all the cliches have been used in this movie, other cliches come to raise her ugly head
