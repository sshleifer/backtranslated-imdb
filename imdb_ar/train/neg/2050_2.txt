This is not a film directed by Olli Lommel, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink below my expectations. There is a new trend among young filmmakers about using digital video in their early projects, which is good and good to give these children the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stocks. But many of these young directors have also favored the idea of ​​filtering the final film so that it looks somewhat like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. The non-filter digital video really works only in the "ironic" style, because it never seems to be anything other than video. Here lies the fundamental problem with ZODIAC KILLER. It looks like watching a soap opera during the day about a killer. Do not feel like watching a movie. The unforgivable thing is that Lommel is not a young film director. You should know better. You must know that it is practically impossible to generate a horror (or even suspense!) On the video. For the love of God, this man has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only manager who has failed to improve his career for forty years. Luckily we wrote the script too! So you can expect crooked actions that mean nothing, unwarranted behavior, or at least a truly conspiratorial element that makes you totally dissatisfied. Please, please miss this movie. You will thank me later.
