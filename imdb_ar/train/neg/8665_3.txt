This is a low budget Roger Kurman flick horror / creature. DinoCroc is created when it manages gene manipulation dating back to prehistoric times. Crocodile Crocodile kills one's human taste first and becomes a quick scare after escape. None of the characters have any depth, but they are not the focal point. We get only a few glimpses of the huge-legged dinosaur grandchildren and some of the best scenes of "murder" in a small budget film. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a sinister character trying to use a three-legged dog to become crocodile himself. There is nothing left on the pavement but the upper ankle feet. With no real prominent roles: Jean Lundikner, Bruce Vitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and a professional crocodile hunter Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed by the seductive Joanna Bakula as Dr.
