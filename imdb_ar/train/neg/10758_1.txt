This film is probably the most boring, the worst and the most useless film I've seen in the last year. I appeared to the plot that was supposed to have some philosophical aspects as a very poor hollow copy of the matrix, with a lot of cliches: cop-wolf only, good appearance, psychologically troubled, sleep with his gun ... + Add a 2 cent plot and have a robot! I have been deeply annoyed by the obvious announcement of brands such as FedEx, Audi, Converse and so on. This film spreads the marketing process and tends to be a bad advertising place, but unfortunately will not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy, if you have some spare time, watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book.
