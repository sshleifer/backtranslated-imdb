I was rarely disturbed by the leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw in this film. Is God annoying or what? Everything says the same tone which is terrible, very terrible indeed, in contrast, Ryan O'Neill is wonderful. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a story. It's rich, it's wooden, and they sacrifice a lot for love. His father is Jackson Stonewall, and is dubbed her first name, in case she did not notice the difference in the two they overcame the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominations for this film suggest it should have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Father Wood, but nomination support? At least he did not win over me. <br /> <br /> I still think Catherine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it's up to me, Catherine Ross would be in many movies. She is definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> So I did not cry when I got sick, and I never thought I would feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was good to see Tommy Lee Jones at the age of 15, and the result was good. But this old age is very old, and has a beard length of mile, and sin that is not old, but feel it.
