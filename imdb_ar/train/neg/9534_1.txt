I'm a fan of the best previous movies. But this was awful. No wonder I encountered this difficult time. I tried 4 stores to rent video, so I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> I really miss Alex Grady and Travis Prigley and the original characters and kickboxing theme with the first 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
