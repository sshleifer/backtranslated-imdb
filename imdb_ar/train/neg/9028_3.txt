I have just watched this film and I said that with this great assumption and great talent, Turkey is there !!! A friend lent me this film and watched it with an open mind mainly because he praised the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a retired fighter pilot ... Why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be appointed by personality Anthony Quinn to be his new pilot ... Well, do not see Costner getting close to the plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner collides with Texan (James Jamun), who sells horsepower to a large Mexican businessman and Costner's horseback riding. Without knowing what had happened, Gammon was tempted to death, and Costner was pushing him to the meeting, which was happening with a partner from Quinn! But, nothing comes from it ... Nada, Xilchu! Why do they have a Gammon character? Why did they sell the horses with a Queen partner if nothing came from him? <br /> <br /> Also, after they leave Costner to die, they make Madeleine Stowe a prostitute, then attack one of Quinn's men who was pushing a bend ... stabbed him with a knife, and the next thing was moved to the monastery! There is no explanation why they were moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> A lot of talent is lost on such weak text and poor editing !! I saw this only because a friend owned it and allowed me to watch it ... I will throw it at him during the two hours that I have lost in my life when I watch the explosive thing!
