For the horror film made specifically for television, the film began to be very exciting. I was really impressed with the story and mystery of the film. But the end was a complete disappointment. The film was fast paced and seemed, anyway, to a very climatic end. But guessed infinitely. The film ended about an hour and a half later, leaving the audience wondering what had happened. Why all unanswered questions have not been answered in the movie. There was no explanation at all for any of the main points of the plot. This movie is like watching a murder mystery and then does not discover who did it. Very disappointed. This film looks like the producers have run out of money and never finished the film. A real bomb!
