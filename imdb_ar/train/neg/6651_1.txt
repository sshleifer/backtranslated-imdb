This is the worst film I have ever seen throughout the year. <br /> <br /> First, I will say that representation was very good and in all actors. <br /> <br /> Seems to be very irregular, and in this regard succeeded. In the same vein, the story revolves around a self-centered, self-centered, unruly, unruly liar, whose self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> This was worse than seeing a car wreck.
