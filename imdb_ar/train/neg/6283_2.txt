What an amazing fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You gather a group of friends at home, all of whom are interested in following Sean Ellis's work. You have a vague idea about the plot, there are no spoilers can kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, an ideal atmosphere for a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> It takes 15 minutes and you begin to tell yourself that you are sure to pick up. In 25 minutes you start wondering if you should go to sleep and save it again when you appreciate the unexpected pleasant touches. Within half an hour, I realized that half of your over-sleeping audience was already sleeping and calling it a day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when all the other stuff has been exhausted, you return to this, at midday this time, hoping to keep you moody this time. After 10 minutes, you quickly find yourself in transitions and intermediate images that are incredible and unnecessary. Any other things I had already given up on but there was a refund and his legacy. But that legacy can only hold you for a long time. This is a new level of boring filmmaking. Imagine a short story that went into a novel with descriptions only, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> Decent representation is lost, there is no cinematography that makes you in awe like a refund. There are movies that bother you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheese, unfortunately, this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final words, stay away.
