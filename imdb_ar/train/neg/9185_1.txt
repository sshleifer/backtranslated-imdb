Wonderful! I did not know that someone would make this movie! terrible! I've written five things that can tell us why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Figure 1: "It's the biggest nonsense ever" Where is this delirium? I could only see a few people dancing around. <br /> <br /> 2. When they are at the edge of the abyss, they can only see the blood everywhere, no people, two ruined tents and one stage .. And what do they do !? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! The captain and his crew .. Awful! <br /> <br /> 4. When a person launches a normal weapon, he fires about 30 times without recharging! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world could fight as a professional! It must be something new ... <br /> <br /> I wonder what the product was thinking! "It will be a great success, it will become a classic." Sure, you are stupid and do not see this film in any way, it represents a tight time. My eyes are still bleeding!
