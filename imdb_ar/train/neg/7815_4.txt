As a longtime fan of Superman comedy, through the 1950s series, the first two films of Chris Reeves, Lewis and Clark, and finally Smallville, I was really hoping for something smart with Superman Returns. Instead, we got Lex Luthor to try * other * real estate conversion, another sequence of Superman-beaten-up-up-kryptonite and internal contradictions: he could not stop himself from falling into the ocean when he was stuck B 6 "of the kryptonite, but when Lewis is separated from 3" of it, leaving the rest contained in it *, can lift * continent * into space? Really, the only hero in the story was Lewis's partner - I can not remember his name out of sight. He has done all sorts of heroic, life-saving things with nothing but courage and skill - no superpower, no blemish ... just ordinary man. <br /> <br /> Keep making Superman very small. Why can not we have Superman fighting Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of the small Lexs schemes. Oh, I forgot ... They're doing it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... I think I'll stick to Smallville ... <br /> <br /> Maybe you should, too ...
