Wow, this is very unusual in one aspect: usually the first film in a long series of sequences is the best. People are surprised when the sequel is actually the best. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst in the group, or at least the first six that included a DVD package from the Tarzan Group. I will gladly watch the series several times but I sit through this turkey, thanks to several characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news first: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Lots of motion with lots of wildlife, even if it's just a video. You see the attacks of lion, crocodile, hippopotamus, panther, you name it, and see many different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called "pygmies" in the film.) Since this film was made almost 75 years ago, That knocks any realism because they have not had in the films for a long time. They are doing their best to stand up to actors who speak in front of imaginary backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of moving scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a handsome and well-designed couple, if there is one of those golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie has a historical value (with many sequences) showing how Tarzan got Jane and his beginnings in learning English. <br /> <br /> The BAD - from the moment Tarzan took "Jane Parker" almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in a hysterical scene and screaming and screaming after the scene. Just give you a headache and destroy the movie. Fortunately, the sequel subsided, but not in this film. The film does not favor "The Great White Hunter," like C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Gene's father and Neil Hamilton, where Harry Holt, the safari guide, shoots every animal in sight, Animals threaten or not. These people are happy to kill, especially Smith. On the other hand, it is very bad that there is no explanation here how Tarzan should be in the forest in the first place. There is no history here or footage of its inception. He arrived there when Jane and the group reached a certain point in Africa.
