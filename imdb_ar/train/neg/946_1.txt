Why this exhibition is very popular? It is beyond my will why people love it. I think it's one of the worst comedies out there. <br /> <br /> Since they are very common, I've tried more than once to see them and can not access them in a full loop. <br /> <br /> For one thing, representation is terrible. Everyone is so exaggerating that it is disturbing to see him. They speak abnormal sounds, use abnormal tones and have abnormal body language. I saw that he was acting better in a school play in kindergarten. <br /> <br /> For something else, it's not funny. The plots are boring. They are not creative, smart or funny. Should not the comic be funny? Why do not I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventies about this? It is as true for the 1970s as Happy Days for the 1950s. <br /> <br /> OH What's up with Ashton Kutcher? Who cast this unwieldy dweeb? Now he makes films? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is a high quality TV, it worries me.
