One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this flick and decided it was very lame. That was true after Hopalong (Chris Lebert) fell on his horse from a tree to join a good man. The Hopalyong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 trick has been greatly diverted, which has not translated into anything at all. Obviously the name Coppola in credits can not do anything to ensure success here, even with more than one runway. <br /> <br /> If you reach the end of the movie, you are likely to end up asking yourself the same questions you have asked. What exactly is a hook with gloves? What's up with the Rodeo scenario? Who was the stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this film? <br /> <br /> Maybe I could continue but my energy drained. See, there is already a West called "The Gunfighter" since 1950 with a person named Gregory Beck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as comfortable as watching this makes you feel bad. This is one I can recommend.
