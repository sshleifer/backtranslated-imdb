It's not bad, because it's credit for being (Hopper did worse) ?? More very disappointing for me. This fantastical concept, which has not really been exploited by Hopper under his economic guidance and even less in smokeless writing (pictorial excuse). The bad guys go higher than the dead serious tone, becoming silly and unfocused, allowing the whole mystery of pessimism / mystery in the plot to be telegraphed easily to end with something completely sudden. Because of this, the speed is still fairly slow, and it seems that Brad Doriff (cool to see him in a leading role) is struggling with an unbalanced performance, though devising a highly twisted intensity for his uncolored personality. Although it is done cheaply, there is an efficient technical attitude towards it. However, they do not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with their idea and want to plaster in bad shakes (some of which work) and evaporate the amazingly special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper displays some of the frenzied images elegantly (and more importantly towards the last end), and the quick maneuver of camera action becomes a dazzling result. The performances are spread throughout the store with the appearance of William Prince and Cynthia among Dee Dae Young, John Seifer and Melinda Dillon. Also Jiroj Backflower and John Landis have a small but amusing veil ?? Especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it is attractive properly.
