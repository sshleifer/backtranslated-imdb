I've read comments that you should not watch this movie if you're looking to spark Shakespeare's dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the animated dialogue, this wonderful play contains, has been cut and replaced with songs. I've read this play, and I've been lucky lately to see what's going on, it's still one of Shakespeare's favorite comedy films, but it seems that this movie takes everything I love on the subject. The princess, although she undoubtedly did what she was directed at, had no royal influence, and all the girls seemed to be losing the intelligence of their personalities - as well as the ill-advised cuts, not only the female characters were actually taken in a sparse conversation, It is a bit disturbing to hear the Princess's announcement; "We are wise girls mocking our lovers!" , When the irony did not happen at all. The news rollers in the movie also disrupted the film, and took many excellent scenes, because they showed the information in the scenes that followed, and were in a modern formulation. In conclusion, an excellent play, destroyed by the concept of strange, unwise cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What are you thinking?
