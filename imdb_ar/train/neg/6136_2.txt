Buck's role in The Kahn plays in the mind of Bob Parker (of The Price is right), who runs a country the same way he runs his show. But there is a lot to chuckle and snore in Turkey. Kurt Thomas, as a "hero" with a small face, offers some great acrobatic skills, but not a whitewash of talent representation at all. There are a few nervous moments (in the village of Crazies, mostly), and some martial arts sequences are mild to say. But any particular movie "Ninja" will give you more entertainment, and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
