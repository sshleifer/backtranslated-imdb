Yes, Mary Dreesler drinks peach juice which you think is a poison and comes out of running. <br /> <br /> Dreesler is good. Never drink my tea cup, but it is a powerful performer that carries the screen for sure. <br /> <br /> I watched this for Polly Moran, whom I saw somewhere else. Here, Moran is fine - just OK - as a friend / foe for Dresler's dress. Too bad she sank into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is good-hearted. The bad guys are trying to steal the city's population. Dreisler wins and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I'm not wondering about the central plot mechanism: the links. This came during the recession, so everyone may know the links and what they can do if they are used well and if used incorrectly. I, however, not from that era, I am familiar with their ambiguous. They're just like different stocks, right? It seems odd to build a story about the little man about a fairly sophisticated monetary entity.
