The only reason I gave it up to 1 out of 10 is that the option of giving it zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time you had. For about 75 minutes, subjected to the worst representation (I do not mean that in a good way too, as in the NERD KILLER which had a very terrible effect) and the plot is not only silly but has absolutely nothing to do with the massacre. The reason I rented this piece of crap was because of the massacre at the address. However, there was only one murder in the entire film and it was very lame in it. It takes more time to see children playing and performing the work of the yard than anything else. When talking about children, perhaps the little actor is the most outrageous child actor since the cemetery fell from the house. Did you mention that he was filmed in the video as well? If you want to get rid of money and over an hour of your life, you can watch it by all means. But if you taste your dollars and your time hard, go as far as possible.
