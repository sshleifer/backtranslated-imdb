Okay. Who was he? Who gave the pistol 10 out of 10? Does your head stumble on the orgasm tubes? There was a lot of you. Did you do it for dare? Is this a kind of worship? Or did Guy Richie register 788 times with different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I will say this. Just because you do not understand the film does not mean it is not wonderful. Maybe you've spent a bad day at work, or sat down to watch a movie after you had a disagreement with your wife and were not in the mood. There may be a more important stumbling block - just like you do not have the intellectual ability or philosophical sense developed enough to deal with. But. This is very, very large however. The size of the elephant is huge XXL - but to finish it all. <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse inconsistencies due to complexity, and please do not confuse these two unburned hours with an interesting film. really. You may think you are very intelligent. You may think of yourself as a somewhat romantic character: an independent thinker who advocates a masterpiece against a group of sheep-like rejecters. please do not. You embarrass yourself. <br /> <br /> The gun is a waste of time for everyone. If you think about it for a few minutes, you'll also recognize it. It was a waste of representatives, a waste of crew, a waste to the contractors, and certainly a waste of precious minutes (you can not bring it back to your knowledge) to anyone unlucky enough to sit through this miserable miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," comes a voice in the dark. "You do not understand its nonlinear line, it means that the story does not fit in a straight line, this is actually COMPLEX and SUBTLE from AUTEUR, it deals with the difficult existential questions, and anyway - FIGHT CLUB was identified when it was first introduced "Because they can not handle COMPLEXITY, they're eating a modest pie now, I bet you hate Lynch movies too, do not you?" <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm very impressed with Lynch. I love Memento, so a narrative narrative in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear. Although I only recently studied it a few years ago, philosophy is of great interest to me. I do not hate the gun for these reasons. I do not like it because it revolves around important and meaningful topics but deals with it in such a superficial and degrading way that it is funny. I'm not a chess player, but Ritchie's idea of ​​how chess works is like a four-year-old idea. I hate it because the characters, without exception, totally alienate me. "AHA!" Ritchie's guns cry. "The man cleverly tilts his hat to Prist!" Just maybe you're right. I think it is more likely that he can not write a decent text to die. <br /> <br /> A gun comparison with Fight Club is really useful. Fight Club has a non-acidic dialogue that makes you laugh. The gun has a stingy fortune cookie that rejects one hardcore that makes your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you re-evaluate everything that happened. I have a gun, as far as I can tell, many inexplicable twists that do not offer any satisfaction because ... well, it does not make sense. If you continue to pull the rug out from under the people, they will eventually drive you out of their house. Then they close all doors and windows. They never let you go back. Start. <br /> <br /> It seems that Guy Ritchie assumes that being philosophical means repeating a mantra of small buzzwords. They are often spoken, but are often flashed on the screen using themes. It is almost satisfactory. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly prominent is how you can marry something very incomprehensible with all the clichés of the world's tired gangs. In the end it is of great importance. You do not care about anything. you do not understand anything. Go home. <br /> <br /> In fact, there was something I really liked: a runaway fighter who suffers from a crisis of confidence. It is a nice. But I can not recommend you to watch the movie just to see it. It is only there for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It is horrible.
