Well, I admit I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (and I'm very impressed), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give MST3K a 1/10 rated film. Although I hate many of the movies I play, some of them are among the worst movies I have ever seen, I have already managed to enjoy some MST3K movies. However, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (No wonder, in fact, that the MST3K writers themselves commented that this was one of the worst.) Believe me, this movie is a good example of what not to do in the industry the movies. The dialogue is very bad, the representation is worse, the filming is pathetic in the direction (while it may be the best thing in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is the worst part of this movie. Several times in this film, the bidders had to wait literally for something to happen. While minutes may not seem too long, they may be in a movie, especially in this film. I'm sure he was aiming to create a mood, but I was very bored. I really felt ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspension of kufr" means "falling asleep almost", that means a lot of it. But the scream of the skull is very terrible, and there is no way I could be interested in anything that was actually happening in the film, so the "suspension of infidelity" did not already exist. <br /> One of the worst, perhaps the most boring film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
