For some reason, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the local station of CBS in New York continued to play the film late at night on Friday or Saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 am or some time. It's a good movie for that time period because it's really hard to follow and very strange (see other reviews for specific story information). Anyway, after catching them several times in those days just before television (and even after I arrived but before they made a lot of night programming), I kept watching this little oddity. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to find out if I could find it on a DVD. Well, it's only available (from every search you've done anyway) in a very poor print on the Brentwood Video card as part of a 4-disc package called "Strange Worlds" if anyone is interested. It is usually available for about $ 10 - but even much less if you shop. The other three films in this collection are readily available in many other collections of public domain movies, so there is no need to comment here. But I have not seen "eyes" available anywhere else. Although it is hardly a "recovered" version in any way, this printing works for 92 minutes, so one time at the specified IMDb run time is 90 minutes. Even with 92 minutes of run-time, it is not unusual for a Mdbalij movie to English from another language that is part of the runtime is cut. It seems that the exercise of the conscience of the budget is sometimes common by saving money by not paying attention to the dumping of some scenes at all if not considered a task for the story. Will the longer version be any less confusing? Who really knows - unless I see him in his native language ... By the way, my attempts to see it during the day do not succeed, and I end up stopping him. There's something about watching this Midnight fits this movie just ... or maybe just from my previous experience, who knows?
