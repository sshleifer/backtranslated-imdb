This is the only thing I can say positively about this film. Cleveland is the star, I've been there and have not seen the city look good. The beautiful river and landscape of the city. <br /> <br /> This movie moves forward very quickly and hopes not to notice that there is no connection to the real world. People run and shoot without any result. For example, there is an exchange of fire in the house of Rob Lo characters - the theft of two cars, yet the police did not appear there until later in the film. It was never impossible to kill because of the hire. <br /> <br /> Each of the film's authors must be on the other end of countless movies. Many actors in this film are much better than this. I check the history of the film only to make sure it was not written during the book strike but unfortunately, it was not. This movie is currently playing on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to stream through Lowe, there's no reason to watch it.
