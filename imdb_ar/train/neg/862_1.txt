"Succubus", the modified version of "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden", is a struggle for sitting, even in 76 minutes. Nothing else from this boring and terrible European horror, I may have slipped into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco has once again presented a truly horrifying piece of the 1960s that seems to have been made by a cast and crew of heads on first-class hallucinations, because not one second of this mess has any meaning at all. Apparently, this is one of his best 180+ movies? It is hard to believe that there are worse efforts there. <br /> <br /> The incomprehensible plot deals with Franco's usual themes about sex, violence and lesbians and receives some of S & M's for good measure, yet it still manages to keep you mindfully bored. <br /> <br /> Have I left it for a long time before entering the terrifying European horror world again? Life is shorter than to spend watching Asen like this.
