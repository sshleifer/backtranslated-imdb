Get this movie as a gift, and know of a DVD cover, this movie will be bad. After not seeing him for more than a year I finally saw him. What a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> I have not finished watching this bad movie, but it would be fair to write a review without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> When I say "suck this movie," I was really shocked that some poor filmmakers got funding for the production of this pathetic movie, but it could not cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. All you need is a cheap video camera or a mobile phone camera. About 15 people with no acting skills, a manuscript written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this very bad move ran a reporter (Tara Woodley) who is supposed to be drunk on his way to report a hunt town. It's quite peaceful. They went to a house they were supposed to give up, but fortunately it was completed and a bottle of alcohol on the door was there. Just supposed to be a drunken man, but not all that seems. <br /> <br /> Then the supposed drunken guy starts telling Tara ghost / zombies. <br /> <br /> The grip of his idiot Lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> His story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Dreiber left one of his soldiers to die of total exhaustion (I think that's what happens) after he left the poor soldier Wilson sitting and leaving him digging a grave and then collapsing the soldier, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> buried in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But the sergeant. Ben Draper in a big surprise n. His wife / evil girl knows about this and she and her lover kill the sergeant. Ben Draber retaliates by the private Wilson (next to the grave of the soldier who has sacked him) the soldier wakes up from his grave in a coma and kills them for revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist was very lame. <br /> <br /> Even if you love BOROR, you do not see this movie
