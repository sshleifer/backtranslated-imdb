When I asked this from the Blockbuster site, I had no idea it would be as terrible as it was. Who do you know? Maybe I forgot to take the ADD sensor that day. I know that from the moment that the crew arrived in their own station wagon, wearing them in their 1970's wide collar collars, bell bottoms and feather hair, I knew that this undiscovered jewel was glorious for the trash. <br /> <br /> The first account of how bad things were known was the narration at first, trying to explain the cosmic forces that were playing their role in creating chaos on the universe, forcing polyester music and pornographic quality onto potential scenes. From the opening scene with the weak influences to the "monsters" of another world and then the house that jumps from the universe to the universe was just as painful as watching an initial school production of "vaginal manipulation." <br /> <br /> During the film, the sure sign that something was about to happen was the appearance of a small ship. The "ship" was suspiciously shaped like a VCR and old video camera and would attack anyone on its way. Of course, if they moved slower than Bob Parker's affected bowels, they would threaten thin pencil formations and the ability to cast a disastrous green glow that could stop the lead and equip a laser capable of cutting balsa wood in an hour or two (with some help). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As the strangeness and bells continue to exist ... we discovered that they were stuck in the "Distortion of Space Time". How do we get this small mass of scientific information? Because older men tell his son that he is, in one way or another useless, like remembering "how I won the big game" on a glass of air or a bottle of cold ice from the refreshing Coca-Cola. Was POP a world? No, but he knew the horses, and he seemed to enter the field of amateurs in string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> The recording you watched on DVD was almost quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer seemed to have been filmed on a theater screen with a video recorder on a mobile phone, otherwise, it was really bad. (There is not actually enough to describe it, really). <br /> <br /> I know that some people like this film and compare it to other classics with worship. I have never seen this movie in its original release, but until then I thought I would have reached the same conclusion: bury this movie quickly.
