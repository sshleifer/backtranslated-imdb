I will spend a lot of time in this review as did the book in the text. This is easily the worst thing that ever happened. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Mark Blankfield's performance was not only GOD-AWFUL, but everyone was also !! Physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seems to have been written by Mongolian monkeys using pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How did the producers succeed in pressing such a vile film feces? So they managed to make veteran actor Ray Waltton look like a less talented joker. Director Michael Schultz must come out of himself. <br /> <br /> I want to spend 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this flawed memory of a wonderful comedy so I could try and condemn all those involved because of this movie horror.
