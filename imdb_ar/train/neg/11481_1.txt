If they could get Ed Asner, why did not they get other representatives instead of people going to the same church as producers? And why the protagonist threw the old wise character on the ground when he was not in danger. This old man has been forced to conceal his pride, so the young man will feel guilty, leaving him a lifelong disability. I think that's why the main character of the money is rejected and why the old man works like a dog even when he volunteers for overtime. If her boyfriend d-bag is a bad friend because he is a long-term friend, why is the soldier better off? He has good reason to be jealous, which is a good reason to keep her away from her hometown and from her guardian father. All characters who are supposed to be loved are not and everyone else is a "bad" friend. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a sawmill mill worker?
