I run a group to stop comedy exploitation and spent only two months listening to horror stories from comedians trying to test "Last Comic Standing." If they do not have a good agent, they will not even get a chance to experiment, so more than 80% of the comedians who attend are rejected before they can show anyone who has talent! If they did the test, I was told it was "predefined" if they had a second chance. So what television audiences see is not the best cartoon in the United States. <br /> <br /> If comedy does this in the show, most of them do not get IMDb balances. I know this because I did the credits for all six seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I do not charge royalties for doing the producers' work. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked, "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why the producers do not give IMDb credits and are banned from their facebook page !!! I'm not a comedy so I have no personal interest in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like seeing anyone being exploited and that's why I helped comedians. Comedians are used on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG THREE network, so those responsible should be ashamed to allow such exploitation. <br /> <br /> Please watch this video from this victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
