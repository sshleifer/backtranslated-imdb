I don, do a large pile of pancakes look good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves at the top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. else. else. Eat. Eat it, you !!! Continue removing it down your throat until your face turns green to nausea. I have experienced Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of 1998 and I was hooked immediately. Like this set of pancakes, I strain myself into it. But pleasure soon faded, because the character of Ally McBeal (whom we see as nice and loving at first sight) quickly becomes more annoying and insecure and grumbles in complaining. (Call me feminist, but I prefer to lead the female to the backbone.) As the gags and tricks of the show have become penetrated, Vonda Shepherd's music (really achieved in your face) has become disturbing, personal changes and re-writing the show appear in the soap opera Curse. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this offer in small doses, and quit smoking once it becomes annoying (and will). I progressed over 2.5 seasons before being fully tense. It was good during his stay, but like his crazy and nervous ex-girlfriend, she turned ugly after she went beyond her welcome. <br /> <br /> The next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Request something healthy like a fruit cup. I will sit with you better.
