Being a fan of vulgar movies, I will usually settle for every oblique film on the retina, sometimes causing more damage than mental benefit. While browsing the channel the other night, Sleepway Camp II happened to cross the tracks with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I heard about the privilege of Sleepway Camp, but I did not actually see any of them (shame, I know). I will note that since I have not seen the original version, I should not take my criticism seriously, because what I think is wrong is that it is entirely intended by designing your own franchise. <br /> <br /> Now I assume that the Sleepaway Camp privilege is, in itself, a joke on itself. Hell, even the name comes a deliberate joke. Camp sleepaway? It's a good fun. I can appreciate the film for wanting to assemble something for the sheer horror of the camp, but that's as much as I can. Make a representation in this film from the original Friday 13th look like thespians doing the delivery of Macbeth. Camby requires bad behavior, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as a savage villain with intangible reality, did a better job in killing my interests than killing her completely. As far as comedy goes, there were several times where I was laughing, but it was a little bit out of the way. <br /> <br /> In the end, the SAC II is very boring and I really want to sleep from the camp. It is clear that the deaths were so fake and fake that you hardly appreciated them. If you are looking for a slanted film comedy with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel takes you through this channel, check what you've seen.
