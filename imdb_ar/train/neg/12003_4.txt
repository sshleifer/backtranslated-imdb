Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty audiences in the cinema. Looking at the eighty-eight different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to see what's going on in the movie. All the stories are not connected to each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationship between them. I tried to find some lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours, I could not find 15 minutes of writing. The film is a poor version of Hollywood Love Films. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. You do not see the movie if you really want to watch a beautiful movie.
