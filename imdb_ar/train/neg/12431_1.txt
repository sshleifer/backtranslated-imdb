I would say that curiosity got my best. If you only see a trailer, I'll be able to tell you the entire plot; it could have saved me more than forty-five minutes of uselessness in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. It was a disaster waiting to happen, which is embarrassing for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film is actually ignorant. For example, a racing car goes for remote control of this child throughout the neighborhood, so enter this house. It's so covered with clothes. Is not it logical to think that the remote control can no longer send a signal under these conditions? It is clear that Hollywood did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictate the opposite; I doubt that a race car can reach the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence possessed by criminals. Why is it in all these films, these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet an eight-year-old child? Is the child supposed to be the smartest person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in the matrix. Also, the leader puts his real gun and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove, one should be able to do so. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there are other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any of them are already working, the criminals have died. But Hollywood intends to "laugh" at the "ridiculous" results of the traps. I did not laugh and sighed and my eyes rolled. <br /> <br /> But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks he has seen a really bad film; the film they saw will look like Citizen Kane compared to this movie. Otherwise, skip this one for your pride. Home Alone 3 raises a question. We all know the stars of Alex D. Linz in the film, but have you also written it?
