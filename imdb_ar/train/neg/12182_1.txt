Well where do I start? I think it's very humiliating to Annie's original with Elaine Quinn. I loved Annie, and I expected this film to be great, but I was very disappointed! I was 25 years old and Annie was still one of my favorite movies, so I was excited to see Annie 2. The acting was horrible in the film, were any of the characters original? Very badly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie I want to see again, and any lover I recommend not watching this film because it will not leave you in a big disappointment. Singing young girls is not bad but still does not compare originally
