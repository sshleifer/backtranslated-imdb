It is the nature of companies that try to benefit from the success of others. Here we have a film that takes elements from Dracula earlier (1931) and Frankenstein (1931) - in a German village village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats) were the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims. Although Universal (and in the Bronson Caves!) Is a feature of Poverty Row, it is not fair to compare them to previous, cost-effective, and superior films. <br /> <br /> From the familiar, exciting and headline-filled music (which must be by Misha Bakalinikov), through the conversation but the good opening sequence, we expect Lionel Atwell, Faye, Ray and Dwight Fry to give us a good film in the thirties. Unfortunately, this does not happen. This is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than the syntactic elements of these films, but with slow speed, low budget, not enough for Dwight Frey, the excessive presence of Ibern's aunt (Aunt Goose), and the hypothesis that Lionel Atwell Neiman (human blood or how he controls his mind with his servant Emil (Robert Fraser) never made it clear. <br /> <br /> You do not technically see "X" (1932) - also starred by Lionel Atwell and Fay Wary but as a father and daughter - before watching this the way I did it; he is an Oscar winner in comparison. Structurally, "The Vampire Bat" is still not good - it accumulates along with a lot of unnecessary talk or comic relief, without a strong focus on the vampire villain. <br /> <br /> Besides "Dr. X And 'Mystery of Wax Museum' (both 1932 and participated in the Fei and Rai), Lionel Atwell is the only armed gendarmerie in Frankenstein's (1939) and Moriarity in Sherlock Holmes and the Secret (1943) ). Dwight Frey steals all the manic scenes in "Dracula" (1931). As a "young fan", Melvin Douglas and Faye Ray have a great sight to kiss, but that's about it. It can be seen in "The Old Dark House" (1932), and by Joel McCrea in "The Most Dangerous Game" (1930). Then there is the 1933 classic "Screaming". Too bad, the money and rewriting of this film was not better available to showcase the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwell, Faye, Ray, and Dwight Frey. Unfortunately, then, this disappointingly disappointing movie gets only 4.
