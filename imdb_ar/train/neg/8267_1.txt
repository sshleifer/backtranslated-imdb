I started to see a pattern in movies I give him 1. It's almost all the movies my wife made her watch. Maybe I should stop trusting her taste in movies. In any case, this is the typical motivation that targets pre-teen girls, but it was worse than usual. Again, the writer broke the basic rule of any film. He / she is making the main character undesirable. Starting from being full with her boyfriend at first, and then discovering when she was thirty, she was basically a common figure (her affairs, etc.). Why do we feel this person? Well, let's say we can go beyond that. Jennifer Garner is far from being as attractive as you can get without having a kind of deformation. I do not know whether this is her fault or the writer's fault, but her character goes beyond my threshold for the inconvenience. The following is advice for future filmmakers: Children aged 13 are not amusing, they are annoying. Away from the most embarrassing moment in the film came when she danced "Thrill". Holy crap that was painful. She showed her practicing this dance at first. That explains why you know that, but the entire club is full of people?!? Erg !!! Makarenna will be more faithful! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how she does her job and nobody notices her. At least Tom Hanks' character on the "big" job has meaning to the child. These films, which transform the body and the child, began to become adult overnight from films out of control, and this is by far the worst.
