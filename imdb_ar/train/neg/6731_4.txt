Unlike other references, I think this is well written, especially imaginary, because it requires greater imagination; it worked well, because there were no other characters to share the concentration of these excellent monologues of more than ten minutes. But I do not enjoy such friendly memories. Everyone has a story to tell and others are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more severe than others. These are just ten stories, not very odd, an example of how a person's life (or part of it) is a feed for movies. Then again, I think the reality TV programs look bad. So, if this is your bag, you may want to. It's the kind of thing that would make a good phone and / or Internet chat; but absolutely without a non-verbal action. Although both speakers are female, I will leave sex.
