I must say that although this film was wonderful through a plot stolen from films like Friday XIII / I know what I did last summer, this movie was not bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of Hollywood's recent horror films. The killings, although sometimes fictitious, were in most cases original. The cast was modest and expected from low-budget features but much better than the larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio. My only real complaint that was not because of the film's budget, which had to be small, was the twisted end. I'm sorry but that's what this film put in a bad class for me. The end was just stupid and eaten. Before that I was a bit bored, but I really enjoyed it. 10/04
