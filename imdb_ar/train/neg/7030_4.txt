One of the basic pillars of low budget cinema is to take a well-known classic story and make a complete bastard out of it. Phantom Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the Phantom of Oprah's permanent story and takes it to a shopping mall in the late 1980s. However, the goal of "Phantom" now is simply the revenge of those responsible for smearing his face and killing his family. Special effects provide a good chuckle, especially when the body parts begin to appear in dishes from the milk stand. Pauly Shore has a small role that is not allowed to be as repugnant as one might expect, largely due to the fact that 15 minutes of MTV fame has not yet arrived. If you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of actors and special effects crew, check it out. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
