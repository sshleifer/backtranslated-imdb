I think Elizabeth Romm, although she has been trying hard, is not good at all. I think the reason is that they were probably the only ones they could get for that price. I saw it mainly for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know well. When it was not on the screen, the thing died. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me a crawl, but be reassured that in real life he is a nice, emotional and funny man. He even said playing this role gave him creeping. <br /> <br /> I'll see anything with him, but Elizabeth Rom - never again. It was as exciting as lint on law and order. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actress.
