The worst film I've seen since Jungerali in the afternoon. I suppose this is horror / comedy. I expected every scene in this film. Special effects were not special. I think I can get good results for what I've lost around the house. I hope I have something good to say about this film, but I'm afraid I'm not doing it. Even Colio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey. I do, after a little thinking, I have a good thing to say about this film - finished.
