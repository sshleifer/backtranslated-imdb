(Spoilers are waiting) Russian fantasy "representative" (I use the term "loose") which I have been trying to watch for more than a year. I have finally come to an end and I wish now that I will not make repeated efforts. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to save two hours of your life, I will tell you he conspires - the man who has the ability to display the long blade of his arm goes home to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten by her boyfriend Mafia to an old girl friend. Take revenge on the man when the girl comes to the house. Mafia mafia men send men out for revenge while police are also looking for him. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. No explanation is really provided for anything (such as why they lock up a friend's identity in a shelter) and work, for the most part it is off the screen. The film consists mainly of a man who looks like Adrian Prodi looks closely and does not say anything, which leads to the killing of people (happens outside the screen most events). Sounds good, acting well, and there was a reason why it might be a good film. Hell, I wish some sense of the real evolution of the character or the back story (all we know is that the man was chosen as a child). The film runs the best part of two hours and resembles six hours. If they do not tell us anything they could have got at least, it's like moving too fast. Not instead we get the hero on a boat. Hero in the bus, hero walking, hero looking disturbed. It really bothered me because I thought it would have been a good film if he simply did something or actually said something that meant something other than giving instructions to "get this guy." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will not go back. Only for those who want to see a Russian action film spoiled with little movement
