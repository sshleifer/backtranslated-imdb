It's hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder did the very funny and very funny Maitres (1976) and now seems to be just "in numbers" of Hollywood thrills. <br /> <br /> This John Gresham material is extremely lightweight, crossed with a TV movie plot. Pollock is Cass Mayweather, an independent and independent crime investigator specializing in serial killings. Ben Chaplin is her co-conspirator in the police Sam Kennedy, and they make a comfortable pair together. Not good, when two unbalanced Maladirute university students (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild goose chase - by planting clever and highly misleading criminal evidence at the crime scene. <br /> <br /> Just enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin failed to create any spark, we also carry many of the past footage full of melodramas that illustrate an important event in the history of Cass. Then of course there are frequent footage of the log cabin by the abyss where there is no doubt that the OTT end will be set. Oh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See any CSI episode instead. It's pretty much more exciting.
