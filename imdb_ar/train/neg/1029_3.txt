My father is a fan of Colombo and I always did not like the show. I always remember my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he keeps watching him at the very least. This is his right as an American I think. But my senses were caught on the serial when I discovered that Spielberg had taken out the first episode. At that time I felt grateful that my father had bought this offer that I could not do. I went through his DVD collection and this thing came up when I came home to visit the college. My opinion was not affected by the series as a whole, but I gained respect for Spielberg knowing that he started like most low-level directors. This makes a small diaphragm until the big fish come (get HA, HA, just like with Spielberg.) It's like Jesus before he becomes a man, or at least that's what I think he'll feel. Likely like this, although it contains a little Peter Falk, I attributed this to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and no one knows where to go after it.This episode focuses mainly on the perpetrator rather than investigating Colombo, as many do Of episodes later.
