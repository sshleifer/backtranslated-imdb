It is clear that Humphrey Bogart did not want to be in this film and was forced to play a Mexican role or was stopped. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! After the success of Dodge City, Warners tried to follow up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hill, Gwen (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Frank Hue and John Little, but they made a huge mistake by trying to make Miriam Hopkins love Laflin against Randolph Scott, as a singer to make things really bad, because they proved one thing, namely that she can not sing. The story was not very bad, but with the obvious bogey error, it turned out that a poor western was extended, with a low budget, but in fairness, color would not help.
