This film is like real life, I mean - not much happens in the next two hours or so, and it is not very clear from the plan or the plot of the game through the often invisible acting crew (being invisible because of "experimental" lighting as I mentioned before) Many reviewers). <br /> <br /> Big bear. It is not a big surprise that Altman helps this - it is a very variable performance (yes we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and Women? Aarar), but the fact that raw materials are a tale John Grisham, and the excellent actors you will see by casting a bleak look at your slumber, make this film a truly bad masterpiece. No, it's not "very bad, it's good". <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
