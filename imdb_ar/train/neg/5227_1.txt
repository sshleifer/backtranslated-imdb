........ and very bad at it !!! How long did this train wreck took? 14 episode or something ?? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I purchased the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase and it was free. This is the only good thing in the experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on acting, because, I think, fairly new people did not really get the job down just right after. At least I have not seen them before in any kind of theater, show or television. If you do, you've easily forgotten it. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were terrible. True, this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek was better than this and it was thirty years ago. I have particularly laughed at the bad guys (harvester or something like that) ship because they chased the hilarious firefly-looking, with the smoke coming out of the engines that look like a giant model rocket. I was quite expecting to see Wolf and Ellie riding on top, while chasing Rod Runner. Modern Jet / Missile engines do not do so badly. <br /> <br /> This was not the worst thing. West-West shooting has made me wonder if I'm actually watching a science film or a film called Jane Utry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the noise, do not waste your time ... I did ... Everything 80 minutes from the disaster is called "Firefly".
