In short, this film was boring. She lacked life and sparkle. Big problem with two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did not have any chemistry at all. It was boring and was annoying. <br /> <br /> The pictures were interesting, but they did not enhance the viewer. If anything, the images tend to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the sequence of events was real, so the film failed to create any real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but it needed a better scenario, better representation, and better director. I kept thinking about the film, you know, if it were Harrison Ford Captain Sky, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical tribute to this movie. I think the critics praise the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed despite its failure at many different levels.
