It seems strange that someone read this text and thought, "That's funny! I mean, it's very delightful and it has to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she already responsible for this? Are they the person who owes me to my time, more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> In most cases this movie is spread. There is no one person of good dialogue, not a pet figure. And the story ... <br /> <br /> The worst movie of all, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred" is so much. It seems almost in the form of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The end is completed by several minutes of recess, and it is still less than 80 minutes. The conclusions include members of the cast, laughing at their "hilarious" mistakes, and the wrong things in this comedy set. Happy to see someone laughs in some way, with some link to this "film". <br /> <br /> There is nothing funny about this movie. nothing. It just goes on and on. It's really lame. I love movies so bad, it's good. This is very bad ... it's something, but I do not know what, and we hope it will never be discovered. <br /> <br /> Amanda Pitt does not suck directly, which is really half the only good thing about this wannabe movie. But that really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
