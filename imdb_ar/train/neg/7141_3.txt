Well, I went to this movie and did not expect much. Some lovely cars some pretty nice girls of decent plot. Unfortunately, I would say that this was probably the worst film I've seen this year. Do not get me the cars were nice and the girls were fine but the way they put out the film was just crappy and clear to put it well. The story never made you interested in the story and the film seemed to have been assembled together. Overall, this movie was not the worst thing at all, but if you're looking for a movie to go to this weekend I'll pass this movie right now.
