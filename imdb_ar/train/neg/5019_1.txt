This movie was a waste of time, so he rented it on a DVD. If you get a high-speed camera shot any faster than this, we may pay twenty dollars for the sink, get the popcorn, and watch the dried spin. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope that he will not make deals any time soon to produce another vulgar movie like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie you should avoid, this is "The One".
