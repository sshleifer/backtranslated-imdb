This movie is very bad, you feel almost contaminated. In fact, there is a strong feeling of relief when it ends, it is gratifying that you can now re-cassette back in rewind and RUSH this back to the video rental store before it blotches the rest of your video set. I suggested jokingly when we hired it, it seemed like a kind of film where William Hurt was "playing" in his performance. I meant he would not try hard. But ha, in a large number of scenes in this film, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! Our recognition of this paradox was the only happiness that we have derived from this confusing mess. Cinematography and editing are mysterious and engraved, the story is messy, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very similar resemblance to "Falling Down," but this film has a story of a daring and daring story, an actor, and an attractive soundtrack. The "polluted man" is just a sort of trap for old broken European tourists, watching it like driving along an unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where the language does not speak in steady rain after dark just as the windscreen continues fogging up. Can you get the picture? Do not get this one.
