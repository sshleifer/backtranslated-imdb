Visually, this film is stunning. She has some delicious black comic moments. But on the whole, the plot is clich√©hed, as is its apparent message. If you are a fan of excessive violence in major movies such as a lodge or a saw, you will love it. If you are looking for something at all, go away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06, and I chose it only because I was looking for something disturbing. In the end, this is not annoying. Just grind and unpleasant to sit through. If you really want to challenge, go to something like The Lost. If you want to get a profit or tell your friends about a really messy movie, this is right for you.
