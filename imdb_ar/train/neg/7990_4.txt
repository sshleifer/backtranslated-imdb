"Anita and Me" is a drama about Britain's multi-ethnic growth, such as "Bend it Like Beckham" or, more closely, "East is East", which it shares in the 1970s. The tone is submerged (despite the dark black accents of the country), but the film lacks "East is the power of the East, and the result is very thin." Moreover, the portrayal of the central relationship between an Asian girl and her white girlfriend is not so deep Enough to justify the manner in which the film is organized around him.I'm also fed up with films where the hero was years as a writer, and this is often normal something that has been experienced by real writers, but it is hardly a new element in a fictional story. Exciting and sharp; "Anita and I" seem clear and boring in comparison.
