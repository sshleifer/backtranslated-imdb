Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered as soon as she went to Italy, tired of treating Hollywood glamor. First, she suffered from a volcanic island torment in Stromboli, and an intruder's failure would have killed a less flexible actress career. And now it is EUROPA 51, another hard exercise in flaccid feelings. <br /> <br /> The story does little for Alexander KNOX, in another pathetic role as her long-suffering husband who tries to calm her down after the suicide death of their young son. At least, this value has better production values ​​and more solid text than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but she is moving towards a more mature appearance as a rich woman in society. She is never able to overcome the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a good male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm out of my mind," she tells her husband. An important statement in a film is not without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story goes. <br /> <br /> Bergman was soon excited to help the poor in Rome after the war, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health, and from there the plot turns worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting to be converted into a major star project like Bergman. The film loses the pace of the story in the middle of the story as Bergman becomes more astounded and doubles her husband as her timing twice. The story moves from there after she nursed a nurse on the street from her final illness. The last thread of the plot needs her husband to place her under observation in a rational refuge. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers in all respects (excessive compensation for the loss of her son), but no use. It is not one of the best of its virtues, put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: If you want new realism that suffers from mental illness, it might be better to accept the zipper in the pit of the snake when it was offered to her director Anatol Litvak !! She could have done more in her career than in Europa 51. <br /> <br /> Summary: Another blunt neglect of Rossellini and Bergman.
