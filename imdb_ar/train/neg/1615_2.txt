Same age same age as Chi. Totally ignored the really interesting facts of the true Chi personality. Sudberg regained the same tedious account of Che. A ludicrous silly tale of an Argentine rich boy shocked by poverty, Robin Hood is fighting alongside the poor, until eventually killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, I heard it all before, boring and accurate! Che Guevara's reality is completely different and more explosive! The facts show that he was an oppressor with the line of Christ, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that in the coldest moments of the Cold War, the Soviet Union begged the New York, Washington or Los Angeles ban and the end of the world. Chi Khrushchev urged a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he declared that if he had his finger on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev retreated and literally saved the world, Chi was angry at "betrayal". If Chi's recommendations are followed, you will not read this review now. How the Maniac of Murder has become a pop icon has made a film more interesting. It was incredible that there was no cinematic director bold enough to show the real side of Che and turn the media after his death. Oscar movie would make a winner! I thought making an independent film meant taking real risks and being worn out! They are committed only to "safe topics in the field of counter-culture," such as "cool chi", "bad Wall Street", "republican = Nazi", "Bush Hitler", "the National Liberation Army is worse than the KGB" Woo, how bold, how the mind is blowing.Tris is against the mainstream, and I hope they have some real fans and deal with the independent oligarchic film!
