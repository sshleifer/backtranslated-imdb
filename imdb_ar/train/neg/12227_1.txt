This may be the worst film ever produced, and perhaps worth watching for this reason alone. Streisand is incredibly laughable as a young woman pretending to be a man in order to study Judaism. The soundtrack is torture, as Barbara shows up mimicking some of the weakest characters ever shot. And do not even make me start the plot. You will actually get more chuckles in this movie than many comedies because they are too bad. The rampant ego in Streisand, believing it could lift this stink in one way or another to the heights of Oscar, led to this catastrophe. I am sure that the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is similar to watching a car wreck in a slow motion for two hours with the music soundtrack playing back on the old turntable. It's really that bad. I'm surprised that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this film at its intended level.
