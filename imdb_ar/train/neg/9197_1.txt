There are some movies that you know will be bad from the first frame. Even if you are completely oblivious to the work of Ed Wood, you can take a look at that commentator from "Plan 9 of Outer Space" and you only know that you will not see the following cinematic masterpiece. So exactly, when I saw the first shot of the Uwe Bolls masterpiece "House of Dead", with that man sitting in the front of the house while presenting desperately while trying hard to appear to be coming from Sin City, I knew I was' on a remarkable stroll. <br /> <br /> So, the film begins like this - first the leading figure says that everyone will die. You know, to keep your wandering. Then he begins to present the rest of the characters with lines such as "Karma .. Think that Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..my ex .. We separated recently .. I had to study and was on the fence." no I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this group of twenty something who could not get out of a wet paper bag would go to the "century delirium", raving at the question of being a few tents, a potty port and a poor stage located on a small island In the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately you'll find a way to get there, and the way a fishing boat run by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get It? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his friend who is a bastard kid from the Simpsons' Cpt McAllister This is the killer hook who knows what I did last summer. <br /> <br /> To make the long story short, the gang arrives on the island, and there is no one there except some bloody shirts and then decide to run hell away from there. Do not wait, they do not do it, but they are really quite happy and like a free vintage cos. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the film reaches the bottom, and then against all possible returns to the slope. Some of the men in rubber suits start jogging, there is some shouting and shooting. Our gangs go to some houses to meet some other gangs. They come out of the house, meet Kirk, some police (including about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go home. Somewhere along the line they turn to S.W.A.T. A team, enter the matrix, men who wear a rubber suit begin to reproduce like bacteria, I start to cry because I paid for this already. To insult the injury, every few minutes there are clips of the video game on which this exciting game is based and there is a sophisticated sophisticated game scene for a few characters when you die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. Not even fit for the famous class "Too bad it's good". It's just bad bad. The text is bad, the zombie is horrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad .. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> You may want to watch this movie only because of its reputation for being awful. No. There are bad movies worth seeing. This is not one of them.
