The story of Django is a zigzag mess for a movie! This western spaghetti is just a collection of scenes from other movies (and much better!) Supposed to be connected to each other by "Django" to tell him how he has resorted to outlaws. Hunt Bowers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one unless you just have to make every Django movie making and so this may not be a good enough excuse to see this one!
