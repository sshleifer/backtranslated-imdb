In some way, time lanes are a success story because the film reaches its goal: seeing thousands. But he failed to make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs has succeeded, because the subject was an original way of thinking about travel through time: forget Zemeckis's Back to the Future, here comes the old France, the middle-aged knight and the barbaric way of life Approximately. Filled with pride and humor thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the result. <br /> <br /> No one expected the great success of Les Visiteurs, the first. It is not useful to be an expert in cinema to realize that the corridors of time have been made for money. <br /> <br /> The public story begins after the visit of Les Visiteurs, and tries to immediately justify the sequel with the time of the paradox that may need some second thought. Explaination: There is no point in trying to recover the jewelry stolen by Jacquouille; do not you remember this shiny red car he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​jewelry ... This is one of the many holes Poiré tries to avoid and fail. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's a bit more bored. As far as Freundund is concerned ... this is another story: Valerie Lemerick decided not to compromise herself in this complement to avoid becoming bourgeois. Muriel Rubin is trying to imitate her in a way she found so distressing that I felt pain for her. The Poiré does not realize that a group of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget the time you spend, about digital effects, focus on the story and you'll see there's enough space for a postage stamp to type 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is landscape. Film for young people, let's say up to 13 years.
