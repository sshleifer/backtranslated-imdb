The subject that the latter is trying to turn into a film world to address in his project (for the first time) is still an old subject of discussion by virtually any cultural standard - timeless romance. <br /> <br /> However, exploration (and exploitation of Desi Auds) is frighteningly short because the usual trends of "pepper, spices and sugar" reach the usual Masala mix of B / G, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. , Create a fantastic looking package with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the film, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Repeats further follow-through film (after each lead character cook). But here lie les problemos - no story! Huh, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh in Cheney is putting on more (excessive) amount of over-representation. When does this man stop? How many 1960s do you talk about like this even when you get annoyed by 30 things? Immortal mind Yes, but certainly what about the Permanent Representative? And only? Sorry, soul? The work was reasonably good by Parish Rawal who has the only reasonable role in the film. The director lacks any sense of realism, discovering himself in his exciting new discovery of a hot new idea. In any place we have not encountered any real problems or problems that such a husband might face, other than actual marriage which is only the first obstacle. The sub-plot of a young child with cancer (the first love for a single boy) does not go anywhere, no matter how little intelligence that this presentation could have evoked, which would have brought him quickly along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, try nice but not there yet.
