In Bridgeport, high school teacher Richard Fenton (Jonathan Shitch) is obsessed with teenage student Donna Cable (Brittany Snow); she watches him kill her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, Donna is feeling better but still under psychotherapy and eating cereal. On the night of the concert, she went with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples from friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel to attend. But the psychiatrist, Richard, escaped from prison and was placed on the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and hotel staff who cross his path. <br /> <br /> A set of cliches with a complete lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad representation of Jonathan Shash in the role of a crazy killer. Scenario Scenario is amazing because it is possible to predict what will happen in the following scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dan√ßar" ("Death calls for dancing")
