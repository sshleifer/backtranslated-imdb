Anyone who loves the classic novels of Edward Oromroyd will be disappointed in this film. All the magic and romance of his original story was updated for a girl doing a good job for a mysterious old lady, and given "three" in return. Three What? There are no three wishes, but there are three rounds in the 19th century on a decrepit elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is all in time.
