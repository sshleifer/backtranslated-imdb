Did filmmakers preview this before releasing it? The script moves from one place to another without giving much explanation. The beginning does not explain whether the introduction or not. Superman starts on the ground and moves to a point after the last film - but does not alert the viewer to it. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential house wrecker, stalker, and person with depression and confusion. This kind of characters rarely makes for an interesting hero. The end is very silly. Superman in the hospital just ended up killing him myself. I seriously await the SNL play show where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Mori says, "The results are present - in the case of the child, Superman, you are the father." Bottom line - well, acting through this program Superman and Kevin Spacey, but terrible. The film is basically inaccessible.
