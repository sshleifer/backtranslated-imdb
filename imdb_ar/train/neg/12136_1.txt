I saw this movie on television this afternoon and I can not see how anyone could sit through this piece of trash. It's not funny at all and it takes your I.Q down a few cracks. I know that this film is for children, but that does not mean that writers should take their minds as a matter of course. I bet the book was sitting around a big wooden table and I think the word "bottom" is a big laugh. B) A tall four-foot-tall dunk can have a basketball net ten feet long. C) Children must always fight the armed hijackers because the kidnappers will drop for anything; and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to hit the so-called ninja with swords. One of the good things I can say about this movie is that it has the weakest "gang" in the suburbs of the world that could not intimidate anyone. Men in MST3K may be able to use this movie to laugh well. Do not care about this wonderful excuse for the film.
