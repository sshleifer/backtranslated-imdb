This is the second time I feel compelled to comment on a film. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen and it was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing Darkwolf at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst film I've seen it was a disaster to see. Apart from the two women who have nude women, there is nothing in this film to remove from the trash pile. <br /> <br /> Let's see, the horrible effects, the smiling script, the bad representation and about 90 minutes are also long. My wife and I mostly laughed at disbelief over how bad. Surprisingly I watched it till the end, how did I do it and I do not know! Avoid!!!
