Most of what I think, there was nothing retrieving this movie <br /> <br />. I've seen it for 9 months, so maybe my memory has made it worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as 4 <br /> <br />. > After watching the film, I met the director. He seemed very ignorant about what he was doing or what he did, and as far as I could tell, he did not care about the film either. He even agreed that he did not really know what he was doing and was forced to do some things because he was digitally filmed. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was trying to fit into the formula that <br /> <br /> put to itself: "9 people must be in touch somehow. Can we move from point "A" to point "B", so to get out of the bitch? <br /> <br /> We see it at first and get back to it in the end. <br /> <br /> A minute about the relationship of each character Someone makes it feel like you're suffocating through the three-dimensional characters, badly painted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi There's one scene where it's amazing ... this is ... As I said <br /> <br /> I say ... 4 out of 10.
