In theory, the "manager comment" should have been successful. Rob Bryden plays the role of Peter Dylan, a former television director who recounts his experience behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked on were Bonanza, Flambards, Duchess Of Duke Street and The Bounder. His comments are not the least useful, because of his habit of roaming. <br /> <br /> But in practice, this process has failed in a frightening way. It's a joke show, and humor is not particularly funny. The scripts lacked quite the wit, and Bryden failed to convince as an old man. Whenever you catch anything amusing to say, which looks like every five seconds, it produces a jerk. Instead of being amused by DeLane, you'll want to shoot it. If older men beat you as hilarious, it suits you. <br /> <br /> It was not useful because the satirical performances were, except for "Mr. and Mrs." and "Crossroads", they are fairly good. In order for humor to work, it must be very shocking, such as "Charlie's Angels", "OTT", "Telly Addicts", "Neighbors" and "New faces". <br /> <br /> Big show time, thankfully so we save the horror of future editions. Would not it be ironic that "director's commentary" would someday be a spoof?
