Often spoilers, Shakespeare's adaptations in Hollywood are an amusing piece of cinema. A beautiful shot is executed well and faithful to the text. The films, including Henry V's Pranage and Much Loud About 1993, are powerful. If you watch "Love's Labor's Lost", it's a big disappointment to expect it to get lost in a scary way. Unfortunately, "Love laughed at work" is terrible! The king of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends for drinks and women have given up for three years to focus on their studies. Plans begin to collapse when the mysterious princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her accompanying delegation arrive. Soon what is love in the air and philosophy is far from the mind of the prince. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this movie is not Shakespeare's. The map was cleverly transferred to a music from the 1930s by Ken Branagh. The plot still exists and the text is still written, but now it has been sacrificed for the sake of the terrible musical taste. Classics such as "The Way You Look Tonight," "Let's face music and dance," "I'm in heaven," are all ruined by weak singing and the strong sense that they do not belong here. <br /> <br /> Apart from the poor singing, we also deal with a large number of exotic performances offered by regular stars. Ken Prana and friends may enjoy making this film, but they provide us with a host of stomach roles. <br /> <br /> All the eight main actors (four men and four women) are all equal, and the only positive on their behalf, there is a great improvement in Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is only one person leaves the movie worth any praise, this is Nathan Lin's brilliant constantly. Over the years, Lynn has proven to be a comic genius and in this feature adds once again the spirit of humor to clown Costard. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say. "Love's Labor Lost" deserves a light compliment to Branagh's original films in an old story. Unfortunately, this is where the pros end. "Love's Labor's Lost," which is weak, performing, rich and built, is the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare in the last 40 years. It must be avoided as a plague and must not be made. A bad and disappointing choice by Branaj and here is his next best effort.
