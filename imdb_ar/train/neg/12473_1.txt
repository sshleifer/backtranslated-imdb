This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything in it weak and incoherent. Acting is absurd, the fashion more fragile and the story does not exist. The goal of "The Sword of Poverty" and the adventure was to capture some of the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but it gives us no reason to follow. The character of the lead is chilly and dull, and he can not even fight with the sword and sword of the sixteenth century. All the sequences of motion as such, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the terrible music history when riding. Do not even bother with this crap.
