Here's a perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. This is not the problem? The concept is new and full of possibilities, but the script and its implementation lack any real content. It should take you away from the beginning and then tighten your feelings a bit, make you interested and invest in characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and keep the trip, which is why. First, you do not really care about characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not superman or an impossible task here, it is supposed to be about ordinary people who have been put in a stressful position. They are not credible in the way they behave and interact. For example: Jeffrey Combs as a chew chew cop is a gum, frown and looks dense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what this ?, it seems to be on the toilet or something. I liked it in re-animation, and the way it was played by the intense / nervous medical genius, who was not worthy of appreciation, was right in money. But not for this, he is trying hard to compensate closely by looking very much at the edge but nervously still light, not natural, I am surprised that he did not take off his jaw during filming. The film basically depends on life, barely contains a pulse, which made me wait for something that will never come.
