Pier Paolo Pasolini, or Pee-pee-pee, is also best connected (because of his love for male genitalia), the most ominous European Marxist director - and he is too heavy on earth. How can anyone see "art" in this turbulent fabrication and cheap sex is something beyond my control. It was possible that some of the "stories" came here directly from a pornographic film, and I do not refer much to nudity but simplistic and vulgar stories that are useless. Anyone who enjoys this relatively modest but stupid stupidity should really immerse his teeth in the German film "Der Schulmaedchenreport" mature in the 1970s, because that's what "Decameron" looks like to me. <br /> <br /> The movie is dirty at almost all levels, from start to finish: <br /> <br /> 1. Edit. Example: In 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds, there is a chase scene that is clearly positioned in the wrong place. It was supposed to be placed about a minute later, but I think Pasolini must have appointed many editors who have little time to get "fine details" for the film industry. Pee-pee-pee fans are likely to address this by saying that it was intentionally put there - which I doubt so much. Moreover, even if it is true, it will be worse, because that story will not achieve anything at all by making it difficult to follow. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of the broken Tarantino movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Fei is dirty. Triple Pee fans (all 8) proudly announce how to use 3P-O "real people instead of actors". (Are not people actors, or are they Mars?) Sure, many actors have below-the-level intelligence but does that mean that we should treat them with disrespect?) Other directors have used amateurs and succeeded (eg Alan Parker or De Niro) Extremely awful in his movies? The answer is again appalling. The Basolini is dirty in everything, including trying to get as many amateur without teeth. It's a lazy exit, spoiled if you love. I would assume ... that the main objective of Puy-Paul-Paul when throwing should be to find as many elderly as possible without teeth (and young people who like them). In the world of Pasolini there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's perfectly good to make them toothless, but at least try to get at least some decent offers from these new inexperienced speakers, otherwise you're an amateur - amateur director, in the Pasolini case. If 3P-0 is not able to do this feat or if it does not, it will not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe not even noticed the awful behavior?) <br /> <br /> 3. Sound. Synchronization. If 3P-0 feels that the microphones are more of a hassle when filming a film, it must at least make a concerted effort in the post-production phase, that is, make all these bum representatives talk about their lines in the studio so that we do not have to watch the viewers move while Float the elusive dialogue elsewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> 4. No concept. We have nearly dozens of stories that are not linked in any meaningful way. Some of them are hostile to the Church (more about that later), while some are just sexual strings. Any fantasy of cheap (and sometimes gay) males is designed to tickle and nothing else. Stories and characters are not amusing (if any) on an intelligent level, but at the basic level. Children 10 years old can laugh here ... There is nothing wrong with that, but then do not call them intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, there is also no logic in arranging stories. that goes without saying. It would have been possible to arrange pee peeing in any other way, and we had the exact same film. This also means that you do not hesitate to start from the middle then back to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" looks like a bowl of spaghetti this way: when you start eating you can start with any theme you want, no difference at all. <br /> <br /> 6. The futility of storytelling. Most stories end with a cheap joke / joke, for example, some dumb stunts are directly cursed from a comic book, while some stories do not even have a result: they just end. Finito. At best, stories are semi-aquatic novels, hardly any deeper meaning there - unless you find the meanings of "deep" in my pornography. Of course, there is nothing easier than searching for "meaning" and finding it in the absence of it. Thus, any blatant pornographic film can philosophize / think without end. It's easy and fun. Try it, you 8 fans of PPP! <br /> <br /> As for church bashing ... some viewers are excited about his attack on Catholicism and whatnot. In general, all this is good and good - after all, I am an atheist myself - but what these people ignore is a simple but fundamental fact that Pasolini was Marxist. It's like a pot calling a black kettle. Marxist criticizes the church because of hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does the nerve get from? Besides, Basolini was not an atheist, so his strong and justifiable position was unjustified. After all, the Marxists are believers: they have replaced only the accepted God with the idea of ​​utopia, which is just another supernatural fantasy. From here I can not get excited about the anti-religious PPP instincts. <br /> <br /> The Anthropadam Hebdurama anthology ends with Pasolini's saying: "I wonder ... why did he produce a work of art when it was nice to dream of it?" He did not really refer to this silly little film as an art, was it. ..? If he is a poor man who is deceived, then I have to wonder why he did not leave it at the dream and did not make all those bad films. <br /> <br /> Do you want to read my revised translations of Bergman films? message me.
