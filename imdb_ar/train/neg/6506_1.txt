Unless you are an eccentric film student who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of your time, money and great disappointment, but it will also make you incredibly angry. <br /> <br /> Maybe a story worth telling somewhere in the interior, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it under layers of chaotic countless random audio videos that seem random, making the viewer's patience weak after a very short time. <br /> <br /> Why can a person like Hopkins choose such a heavy, very difficult and very unstable project, like his first and the first and the third film that anyone can guess. Perhaps he played with him in his mind for a long time until he became recognizable as he became, not even to himself. The result shows that he does not have enough experience or skill yet to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest films by Carpenter and Lynch, to name just a few non-traditional filmmakers, had a 90% correlation, 95% fewer characters and a 99% larger story flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony I was aiming for the stars, but unfortunately I missed a few light years. Please stick to the work, in this section, you are an unparalleled giant and no one should ask you for more, not even yourself!
