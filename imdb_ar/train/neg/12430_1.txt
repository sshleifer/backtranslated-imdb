Home Alone 3 is one of my favorite short films. It's the straw of the crop, or *** if you tend to be more ironic, because it ranks (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could be worse than the two, because at least these two made me laugh at their stupidity. This made me feel pain constantly and clap as the credits began to roll. No other film made me feel pain. Now I will explain exactly why this film is unbelievably terrible. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) And how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> The action followed is similar to the action taken by the other two Home Alones units, with boobytraps and everything, but watching these boobytraps being performed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I did not laugh (or even smile) once, instead, I dealt constantly and I hope that the terrorists will nail the child. The bird, instead of providing comic relief, was annoying and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Representation, like a series of names, ranges from poor to horrible. There is not one good performance here. Alex de Linz is not as popular and completely unfamiliar as a child, while the terrorists (and judgment by their movie credits, because they have been hastily chosen from the street ... and so, that's all. <br /> <br /> I can see some People say, "Man, it's for the kids, do not delete it, man." Well, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. Scooby Doo and Garfield (sucks - see those reviews for more) are better than this! <br /> <br /> So in short, this is an unbelievably horrible movie. It is totally torn apart in the first two; the only thing is, it completely humiliates the first two as well.There is no human being, child or otherwise, should find no reason to see the house alone 3.That is bad. br /> <br /> 0/5 Stars
