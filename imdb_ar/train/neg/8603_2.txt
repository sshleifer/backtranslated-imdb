It could have been a fairly entertaining movie, but instead it is classified with other favorites like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the film's food chain. If they played this soft tongue, it would have been a very entertaining movie, like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Joan Becor Simon plays it in the tongue in the hidden places but more frequently. <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is a small community surrounded by mutant mollusks. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near the sewer line that turns molluscs into aggressive monsters that eat meat - although the monsters move slowly and can be crushed under your box. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two of his accomplices are the only two willing to fight the molluscs while the mayor and city mayor believe they are insane. Its climax is a laugh - unintentional - that makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriters) scenario the destruction of molluscs. <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (No new land) Draw here. Simon seems to play the role of tongue elements in dialogue but dialogue is straight. If Simon had worked with clever text - one of them contains a lot of individual lines and eccentric characters, this could have been a film of worship). The violence: $$$ (We will not let you down here, we get lots of chest cavities exploding and the big head explodes in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant.) Blood and courage, many horror movie watchers enjoy the full swing here. , You can also get the bodies of people picked up by hygiene by molluscs and lots of smash-cracking scenes. <br /> <br /> Representation: $ (F) Michael Garfield seems to know that this scenario is stinky and that he delivers his lines with the facial expression Suggests that he knows how serious this film is. "Kim Terry, as his wife, does a good job even though she does little to scream. They were all terrible actors - no exceptions, man, could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) Nudity: $$ Two teenagers get naughty in bed before sending them - in Mashhad Too bad - by a group of molluscs that crawled into the girl's bedroom.
