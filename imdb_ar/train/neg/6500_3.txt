Look, I'm sorry if half of the world hurts this, but life is confusing enough. You do not need to watch it this way. Anthony Hopkins dug, a great time. So I saw the fracture, and I knew it would be a pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well portrayed, and it is not bold - even if it is a technical. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and quick edits, not this "Oh, but it's a realistic explanation." This thing will make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you anywhere. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if it's not time for you to see bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
