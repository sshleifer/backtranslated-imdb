I watched this movie with high resolution on TV. I'm in a wheelchair because of my nervous disorder and I want to watch the few films that have been produced for people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first, I found the main character noble and somewhat attractive. His message about the disabled and the time he spent fighting to identify and integrate people with disabilities into the labor market in the mainstream society is a great one. My problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and completely opposed to the very message he calls, which I find offensive. <br /> <br /> First, no one in the role of the title has been physically disabled. Certainly they were competent representatives, but it seems that it is very difficult to raise awareness about the employment of the disabled and therefore not to employ the disabled in reality for anything in the film. More complicated is that in one scene in the middle of the film, he sees a man walking to a platform on crutches, and seems to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is obviously shameful. What? Could not find an actual amputee anywhere in the movie? For the 5-second experiment, was it financially preferable to have CGI effects instead of just renting an actual cut? At that stage of the film, I found it deceptive and totally opposed to the message I was trying to convey, where I came here to deceive and imagine it like the pathetic cripple that hit me. <br /> <br /> Find out.
