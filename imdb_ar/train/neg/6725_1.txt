What could have been an attractive and emotionally charged personal study is completely undermined by predictable factors. Fox is fine because Nathaniel Ayers, the musician Juliard, who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Philharmonic Orchestra until schizophrenic episodes lead him to the street and eventually slip down. Journalist Steve "Robert" rehab "Downey} is looking for a good story to promote his career, get to know him and tell his story. If we take every element of the classic film "How we got to skiing" and borrow it in a very free way from "A Beautiful Mind" and take a "good sense" attitude from films such as "Rocky," you choose the serial number and the whip also increases a lot of melodrama Like the 1930s all that remains on the screen is the burnt shell of the movie. It is vulgar, vulgar, completely predictable and plays a lot on our feelings. I hate to say that, but that's the kind of film that, if you say you hate it, people will give you a bad look. I really wish to say something positive about this film, but I can not do it. Represents it to some extent, but it is not enough to give more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie stuff. Not worth your time.
