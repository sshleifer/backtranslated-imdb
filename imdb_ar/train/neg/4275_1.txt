I can not understand why many people praised this offer. The Double Tops are one of the most boring games I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I've watched all episodes of the first season, and watched the first season of episode 1. I simply can not see this program any more. . <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the appropriate incitement in criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In the first season, there was a scene where customer Cooper threw stones at a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He only wants to identify the killer by doing this "joke" with reference to the miraculous power of the Tibetan dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this view. <br /> <br /> For example, the second season began with a "funny" scene presented by a stupid old man and Cooper's agent with a glass of milk while Cooper lay on the ground. (He has already been shot in the stomach). This old man does nothing but say some stupid comments. That's it. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and long lasting (3 minutes 30 seconds .... it's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I was reading some picture books instead of seeing this show anymore.
