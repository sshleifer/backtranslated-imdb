Truly a terrible film. It is expected, though. Obviously, the budget is low: there is nothing innovative, representative (if you can name what you do "acting") who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene, a man wearing a reptile-style suit nearly predator, forest cabin, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, there are some parts that have not been greatly replicated. For one, the black man does not die when he is attacked (the first time), which is not even one of the first couple who die. But this is simple. More importantly, there is a very interesting development regarding the experiences of Kat and Wes & Steve that I have not seen coming. When he told Steve Cat that he knew what she had done, she believed what he had said and what Kat responded to. But when the creature revealed its identity, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of revelation. This may be due to my lack of experience in this type, or it is a truly intelligent development. <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie is very bad and you do not see it if there is anything better ... unless you are in the mood for a cheap scifi dust.
