The nerd Marty (Simon Scudamore) is sexually abused by a handful of his classmates and then falls into a laboratory explosion (also put them) with his acid face wrapped. Years later, all the tremors were invited to high school (since its closure) reunion. What they do not know is that Marty calls them back to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are closed in school and Marty begins with revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. The murders are creative and shocking and there are some scary aerial shots of the abandoned school - but that's about it. Scudamore's insults are more than severe (he was stripped of his head, his head in a toilet and burned) and uncomfortable to watch him. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after their release makes it almost impossible to view. Also this film goes out of his way to get nudity. There is a complete interface to Scuddamore (surprise for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath on her own ... after they know that a killer is wandering around after them! Then there are the couple who have sex. This is the kind of film where the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can move on. It ends with a twist that made me bend over and my eye spin, then another twist made me want to throw something heavy on the TV! Representation is possible - not good, but possible. Caroline Monroe in this too. She is a very beautiful woman but she is not much represented. <br /> <br /> This gets 3 in some wonderful murders and atmosphere. Otherwise it is running mill and forgetting. Scudamori's tragic suicide gave this movie more attention than it deserved.
