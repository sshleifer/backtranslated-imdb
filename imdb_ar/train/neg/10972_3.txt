This was not a film about Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie. It was a great wannabee. She wanted to be a laughable film, emphasizing urban life, but more than just a camera mess. It is much easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I did not care much about personalities or what they were involved in. They always beat each other or urinate or cry. Only, there was no content for what they were doing. Interpersonal dialogue is meant to be lively and revealing, and instead it appears trite, and one scene after the other can be predicted. I know there are viewers who really liked this film, so I might be wrong.
