Oh Lord, everyone who makes this turkey needs to be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer should not watch this movie, you should watch something else, or have not seen a movie before ... 9 out of ten stars? He says what, is it as good as Ben Hur or gone with the wind? Funny characters are widely believable, ridiculous positions, seemingly filmed in Griffith Park (which works well - MASH was filmed at Griffith Park), a strange script, completely about everything that could be wrong with a movie that was wrapped In one package. Viewing must be required for all potential filmmakers as an example of how the film might be a terrible mistake. It reminds me of something that a University of Southern California student might make for a film. <br /> <br /> Give this pass a single statement unless you take drugs and live in a high camp.
