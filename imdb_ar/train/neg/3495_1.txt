Watch episode. Yes, I sat through the whole miserable experience, and I have to say that this type of comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, the family of Guy's fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (clearly slim and lacking glasses), but now lacks the thing that made him a joy. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know that he is an idiot. Sarah has no real personality and has no ability to withdraw her character. Perhaps the silent and complex jokes that draw her comedy less than her character can take on her own. Maybe it is the lack of certified chips. May appeal to her non-sensitive and fanatical personality to the unenthusiastic and fanatical people, in contrast to the overall appeal of Steven Kulber's non-sensitive and fanatical personality. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a disturbing and funny character. It lacks something necessary for this kind of satire, not to mention the whole comedy world. What Sarah Silverman lacks. When you do not believe it and deal with it, it's no longer funny.
