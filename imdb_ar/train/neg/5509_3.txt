When I was a child in the 1950s and 1960s, everything about Disney was wonderful by definition. what happened? They are able to get representatives and representatives who want, their best time. But somehow Disney managed to improve things despite its abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can provide the best writers, best producers and directors, but still ... discourages things! This movie is nonsense. The sad thing is that I doubt that Disney in her arrogance does not even know when the film is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It is due to the talent of the actors only that it is possible to give it 3 out of 10.
