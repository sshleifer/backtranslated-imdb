I went on a visit to one of my relatives for a while, so we surprised the theater, so we thought we would go and give this film a chance. What an error! This movie is awesome in every section. I have never heard of the film before, and everyone still does not know it. No wonder, this is the rank as it gets. It's comedy, he says, well, the only funny thing is the director's ability, or lack thereof, to produce such a film. Approaching Christmas, this title should be how to cook a turkey in a little over an hour and a half - or no matter how long, it has come out. At the end of the film, you will feel as if you poison food on a sick turkey, and regret that you wasted your time in such a country. Who knows why such things are made? Some people had come out of the theater before the movie ended, and I blame myself for not going out very early. It really bothers me that you pay good money to see something decent, everything you graduate and you see that it is a bad TV movie to be shown at 2 am, in fact, it is bad, and at the time of television should not show it. What can I say ... maybe not enough bad words can do it justice.
