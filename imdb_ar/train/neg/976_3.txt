I am generally more willing to open up our mind about rom coms than many, but this simply was not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with British origin - I have not seen, and I doubt it. It's about a zigzag plot, a lack of chemistry between threading, and the remarkable personal performance of the supposed male lead. <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on the screen wearing a hairstyle and a 15-year-old hairstyle and acts on a smaller contract. It is supposed to be a landmark, and of course it is well known that schools around the world like to practice the less mature children who claim to be educated. This character is so upset and irrational that I have doubts about whether any actor can make him loved, but reliable like John Kozak or Adam Sandler. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor representative, but seems to think they are both. Not once in the whole film, does Fallon believe in his role, or think there is any way these two people should be, or will be together. Near the end of the film, there is a scene where Barrymore (who was nice as usual but can not carry this person alone - is hard to have one romantic person), Fallon is over, a lot has happened and she is moving on. Instead of feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively reviving it - and finally doing what you should have done for months. But of course will not allow the mechanics of the plot to be the end (the end may in fact have issued a statement of this mess), and instead, we can see the wise professional girl who all aim to chase her after this foolish childish and encourage his illusions. Of course I was meant to be troubled and satisfactory, but in fact made me feel more disgusted than anything else.
