Revolution of bad zombies. There is nothing interesting about the film. It is dull, has no life, behaves badly, and is poorly written. I have complained a lot that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, well, this film makes Dracula look like a tour of the roller coaster. It looked like 65 minutes in a row was 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> Story: A mission to Cambodia is sent to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". The man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens, the zombie under his control is released into dire consequences. This is. This is the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I saw the male bullets. Looked very familiar. I had plenty of time to think about it. Nothing happened in the film. Before the Zombie Rebellion, he hit me. He was Dean Jagger. I recently saw him as the general at White Christmas. This is how I "enjoyed it" during most of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not buy a DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece in filmmaking compared to this film. For what it is worth, I will give it 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because believe it or not, I've seen what's worse).
