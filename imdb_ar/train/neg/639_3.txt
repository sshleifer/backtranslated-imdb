The clich√©s of the soldier who was accidentally shelled from the house treated the war as a bland treatment. It is unfortunate that the wonderful crew, which works according to their high talents, can not recover the "return of the soldier" from his inability to move the movement of the viewer to the emotional participation. The best moments, as another reviewer observed, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even the power of good cinematic Jackson can not pull the chestnut of this film from its cold power, which has never regained. Anne Margaret, a reputable sexist who often accuses her of being incapable of acting, finds that her real and profound abilities are wasted here - despite her impeccable tone from Middlesex. The vulgar outcome, which was prevalent in many of the weak TV series that excites the drunkard, provokes anger with the emotional dimension of the text, the ban and the excessive formalities in the direction; except for its points, distorted texts and direction, the "soldier's return" has all the correct bits but fails In making them work together.
