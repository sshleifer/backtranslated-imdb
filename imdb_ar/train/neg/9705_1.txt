I saw the film as a child when it was shown in the theater and it was so bad that it became a family joke. If the label is zero, this movie will get it. The dinosaurs were terrifying. The story was ridiculous. Acting really does not qualify for acting. The only reason I remember the name of the film well is that my family is still talking about how bad the situation really was.
