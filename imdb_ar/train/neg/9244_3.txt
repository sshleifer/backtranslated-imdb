One can deal with historical mistakes, but this film was too much. In practice there was nothing close to the truth, and even for the age, it was seen as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In defense of Ford, revealed in an old talk show, he was working on the story as told by the real White Erb, who was obviously old, demented, and recreated the scene in his own way. Erb told the director about the incident and how it was planned during the arrival of the trick, so despite what other historians claim, Wyatt himself asserts that it was intentional. <br /> <br /> This film depicts Erb as a man's secretary, as well as his brothers. History does not exactly say they were or were not. Most people like to interfere in deception and break the law in their personalities, but this is nothing new. Perhaps the truth is closer to them because they respect the law of the game Gunfight AT THE CORRAL. Men who considered it a profession, believe me, in the old West, you do not have time to think about many other things. <br /> <br /> The characters that do not exist, the characters who die in the corral who did not really do it all make it a weaker film. It is weakened by the mature, who did not make a convincing document. It may be the worst option for Doc at all, but at the same time we must remember that old films were closer to the age and closer to the sense of truth. After all, Ford got direct information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It has also been weakened by predictable events involving Mexican girls. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi in those days and was willing to kill brunettes in a very predictable way to show their patronage of Hitler's idealism. This happens in most movies until the 1980s. It is not an excuse, it also reduces the cost of art. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, mature may be the only negative side that behaves in this way. Still, it is the weakest of OK Corral's old films.
