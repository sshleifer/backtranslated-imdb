Can a fake scene destroy a picture? You will not think so, but this is already for me here. Listen, I have a lot of classic era movies and I know what to do except, like drivers who drive non-animated cars in front of the screen, etc. But much of the roaming has to do with the scenes of the movement. For fake landscapes, mountains and fake flowers are exposed after the shooting as described in "Brigadoon" for insulting after a moment. <br /> <br /> As far as music entertainment goes, this is always subjective. What songs someone likes, and others may not be so that they do not have to be a big part of judging a movie (whether someone likes songs). I was able to blow up this film because of its 1950 dance songs, dances, romances and characters, but that was in the 1950s and many people liked this kind of thing. The musical performed well in the 1950s. I loved the 1930s and 1940s with great taps. By the 1950s, it was clicking out and these new things - which I could stand - were there. Does this make the film lousy? No, he makes one person I did not care much about. <br /> <br /> Despite good acting, good director and high expectations, this film was blown up at the box office and with me. I should have loved her more, being as soon as possible, and this is a nice part of this story. I'm not cynical and his nice town and nice people makes me feel good from the awful sounds. Then why can not I communicate with this film? Part of it was also dancing. I do not care about the stuff that replaced the tap dancing on the screen. But - no - the thing that really shut me down from this staging. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a rosy-looking background to make it look that way and it turned me around from the very beginning. Record one point for a realistic day where they "go to the site" most of the time.
