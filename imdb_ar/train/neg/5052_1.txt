The platoon will go to the Vietnam War as the Rocky IV is a heavyweight boxing tournament. Oliver Stone's story about the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is highly exaggerated. While most or all of the events in Platon occurred over a period of more than 10 years of US military intervention in Vietnam, filming these things for a small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a terrible picture of war . In the platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in a week or two: American soldiers killing civilians, American soldiers raping civilians, the American sergeant who kills another US sergeant, a US soldier killing the US sergeant, US soldiers killed / 90% + killed or injured in the faction. Sixty's attempt to pass this film because the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I recommend are "We Are Soldiers" (TRUE story about the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's Bright Shining Lie.
