I've been a great fan of Lynn Peterson since her stunning role in "The Far North" 1988, and although I love her in her other film "Slow" (2004), she plays "Francis" away from her stronger role. <br /> <br /> Lin plays, as I'm sure you all know (or should), the crucial role of a "driver." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than Lin's stunning performance, I am afraid that this film does not really go much. <br /> <br /> Oh wait - there was something else - the amazing creativity of editing to remove the words viewers on TV. Unforgettable lines like: "You're a pistol boy!" , "You are a charming son!" , "shoot!" , And "Well, forget you!" <br /> <br /> O.K. Bye. <br /> <br /> P.S.: Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson sticker?
