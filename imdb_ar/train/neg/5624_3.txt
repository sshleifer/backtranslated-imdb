In his short 40-year-old book on the ground, author Jack London managed to gather as much adventure and adventure as possible. This 90-minute film, which claims to be a biography of a man but clearly fictional, does not scratch the surface, and remains a very mature story to recount in modern times. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, depicts London, and his performance is harsh and sympathetic. It is not the problem here. Susan Hayward is not very young and beautiful, playing the role of his future wife, Charmian, whose autobiography in London is the "foundation" of this film. The life of London has been divided into a series of episodes that the film skips slightly. So we have short incidents with London as oyster pirates, his repayment in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in Yukon and a reporter during the Russian-Japanese War ... colorful events, certainly, but hardly anything was given as a deep treat. The direction of Alfred Santill (who also directed one of Suzanne I's films, Our Leading Citizen, 1939) is not surprising at best. Making things tougher here is a very poor quality DVD, with a great print source and the sound of Hesse. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, is a DVD add-on: a list of all Alpha Video movies, which include hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Let's just hope these films are in a better position than Jack London!
