This is a classic smelly product with a great actor team, mostly older people who have passed their first sleep and sleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a very frustrating movie when you think about it. Stay on the ground and you will face illness and eventually your death. <br /> <br /> Gwyn Ferendon has shown she is still dancing. Too bad that the film did not focus more on it. Maureen Stapleton, who is looking for a bold hawk, is still showing these steps from the Star Queen's Dust Hall, dating back more than 10 years. <br /> <br /> I just hope this film will not encourage older people to commit mass suicide at Jim Jones' level. How can anyone be stupid enough to say that it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Amish win the Oscars for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the elderly are doing this wonderful thing in the end, why was the young man encouraged to get off the boat? Why ship Steve Gothenburg jumping as well? After all, he found his sweetheart. <br /> <br /> This was a great movie if the elderly were just able to find the Fountain of Youth on Earth and stay there. Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Primley, in writing these lines, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Amichi, Tandy, Cronin and Lord are all known to have departed. The book should have taken the script and placed it with this group as well.
