I found darkness to be just too bleak. She had some kind of brilliant ideas and some ambitious ideas, not bad animation scenes and some horrible moments to make you go to UGH! However, the underlit was quite confusing. You do not really know what's always going on in the dark scenes and for the film being filmed in Super 8 Film, you already have all these bad pills to deal with. As with Nathan Schiff's films, it's too much. It seems that director Lev Junker wants to make an original film, but lacks the expertise to do so. The camera is never directed in the right place, and there are no basics like how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie. The actors are all very uneven and hammer. But despite these negatives, the music is good, many prevail and range from silly putty to really good hardware. Is this classic as he says? Are these two discs worthy of praise? No. But it's a good first try. Now if these young people stop highlighting this film (which I understand here is the only movie they've ever finished) for a while and try again, they might do better.
