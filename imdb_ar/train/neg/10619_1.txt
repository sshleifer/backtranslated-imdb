... but the film is lousy. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, it's serious ... very serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about the elderly who inhabit the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... The movie is all talk Modern Talking Modern Talking Talk about the same things over and over again. I actually fooled several times! The film is too boring! The actors were sleeping through this except for the only exceptions to Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably an emotional act for both of them (they often complained that the horror films were too violent ... well, that does not include any violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you suffer from insomnia ... this will make you sleep!
