The Wenders were great at Million Dollar Hotel. I do not know how to reach this film! The idea of ​​giving position after spt11 and the view of American society is hope, which makes it out of ten. But this is not a film. This is the best thing anybody can do with a great idea (the West-East conflict). There are important things happening in the Middle East that are only released on the MAC screen with the fingers of an American girl who is really stupid. The characters are not well. The most important thing is that the idea that is given with religion is somewhat funny to me. In the final scene, Lana says she only allows calm and listening. The background music says "... I will do the supplication". It is not really about religion. But it ends there. How will you see the truth if your eyes are closed and prayed? The lights are already shining on the truth. It's just that no one wants to see it. The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence, but it gets lost behind this movie. (By the way, since "people" are listed below, the finest young Americans are not the best; only the "poor" and the "desperate" who share the army need good checks not provided by the government!)
