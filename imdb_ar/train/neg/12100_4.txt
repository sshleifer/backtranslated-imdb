Now do not get me wrong. If you need a concise summary of everything wrong in the history of human civilization as well as a flawless way to a brighter future for humanity, would it be better to resort to a comedian and practitioner of popular culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid solid reasons behind the survival of the surviving debt, it is useful to resort to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God (?)! This is a good point in itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a nervous disorder that appropriately ignores how to consolidate its entire society, its art and its sciences. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies heavily on his most courageous skill set of irony and irony. To clarify his point of view while trying to appear wise. Unfortunately, his idea is not at the task level. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh but clearly he is not the brightest in the box. For example, he responds to an interview (and I use the term loosely because they were all "ambushes") asserting that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact with a dead end "no, no" followed by a long stare conveying contempt in the naivet√© of the subject the movie). The problem is that the person was right and that Maher had misinterpreted that Jesus was mentioned only in what the Gospels considered historically suspect. I think Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But audiences will flock to this fictional documentary while doing the imaginative works of other intellectual giants such as Michael Moore, and they will loudly betray and guffaw (they certainly did it in my show). <br /> <br /> However, it is doubly telling us that the highest degree of dominance and mule that occurred in nearly 70% of the time of the film's presentation was anti-Christian bands while the audience was completely silent during the 10 % Devoted to self-described criticism of the religion of peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is forbidden to the target audience hip and liberal or they were afraid to laugh. Very telling, in both cases ..
