This film was more effective in convincing me of a Zionist plot than of being a Muslim. I am a Jew. <br /> <br /> Does anyone go to the journalism school? Read the editorial? A year student letter? These disturbing assertions, presented in a palatable way, may be convincing. But by making no acknowledgment of possible conflicting arguments, no viable solutions (or any solutions at all), few sources and every dubious origin make the argument ineffective. <br /> <br /> Thank God for that - I do not want anyone to leave the theater believing in any of this racist streak. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - hopefully a warning story for you - to read a film about the movie before watching it.
