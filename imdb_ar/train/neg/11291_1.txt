Shish! What an awesome movie. A dribbling camera, a scenario with more than one kilogram atom, acts so smoothly that you can open a pig farm. <br /> <br /> To overcome all this, no target audience is known - we have Cornell Wild - or is Kenny Wilde? - Get his soap box about the dangers of smoking any time someone lights up a cigarette, my dear dear, and in another embarrassing scene, we have Paddy, Lobo, forcing him, if you want, a "male friend" to do striptease wearing a bikini. Try to explain this to one of the children ... <br /> <br /> Throw in the very scary Treasure Island-cum-Jaws story, the result is a very funny movie, it's fun - I should not expect a DVD special version at any time Nearby.
