Interestingly, the novel without a plot became the basis for two films. Although The Heiress was a good adaptation, if not quite accurate, Washington Square is a harsh film and misbehavior, except for a part of Dr Sloper, a film that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I actually stumbled. It contains nothing of the simple and simple beauty that a movie can enjoy without a plot, such as Onegin. I agree with other comments about portraying me as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her for not feeling it. <br /> <br /> Katherine's transition from childish trust to extreme irony has been absorbed, the whole story, as in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a movie! I think someone went beyond the adaptation class at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to produce an influential film and a beautiful piece of text that was difficult but did not work.
