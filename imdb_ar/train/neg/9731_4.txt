Others have already commented on the "retreat" of director Toby Huber, but what about Brad Dorf? He was quite able to choose good projects (as demonstrated by the third "exorcist" championship in the same year). Why did he agree to appear in this? It certainly provides a properly hidden performance, and the film is not quite bad; it's just uninvolved, monotonous and unattractive. This three "un" too many. (* 1/2)
