Well, EYEboy, I have to say it's a pleasure to end up when someone tries to mock me and tries to make fun of me, especially when the person is as smart as you do. The favorite part of your message was "But there's no big angry angry man, here, Kimusabe, I suggest you stick to the film with Lutsa Bang Bang." <br /> <br /> Well said! I love motion movies, especially if they are good, but I also love movies that do not contain a lot of actions, as long as they are good. I'm sorry, but Secret and Lies do not correspond to this category, which is simply a very bad film. I really do not see much non-American films, so maybe I was pampered, and I did not realize the size of really bad foreign films when I saw secrets and lies. Perhaps if you judged the foreign films according to different standards, one day I could see how "Secrets and Lies" could be one of the top rated movies on IMDB. Well, if that's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
