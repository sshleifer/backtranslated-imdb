Turning a group of unwanted and unwanted characters and turning their way through a frail plot that might be interesting, if you could just bring yourself up. This "twisting and turning" I'm talking about does not refer to the story (which contains all the suspense in the ceramic tuna recipe) but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces focused remotely in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice gills and her left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the film is the big names he convinced her to do. When you think that this movie is never shown in cinemas even though it has a star team, you tend to think of something stinky. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is.
