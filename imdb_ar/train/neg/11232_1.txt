it's a sad thing. Although this was filmed in the film, I think it stinks a little more than clicks like Lake of Blood, there is nothing there. The music they hold in this is the most extreme thing I have ever heard of. I love the brother and sister in this film. They both do not try hard to appear cynical when they say things like "My friends will be jealous!" Hey, what with the killer wearing his mask just at first? This is retarded! I have practically ignored the second half of this. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. Same exact sound for each stamp!
