For a film with many promises, it was disappointing, thinly painted, and ranged between terrible and unreasonable. The plot contained more holes than Swiss cheese, the worst clich√© I ever saw in a movie. The last scene had taken my heart out, if the entire film was not very painful. You're numb! From the first scene - one wonders whether the sister is trying to reach her twin husband for help, or simply scare her to death, which would have been better for the public and saved us from two hours of my worst behavior. We have seen so far. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
