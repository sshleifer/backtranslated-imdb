I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed because I'm from Melbourne, where the film was produced. Demonic representation, the effects of amateur makeup and soundtrack really bad. For the plot, well, this is more stupid! Some scenes left me amazed at how bad it was. There is a reason to put these types of movies on TV late at night - because they are absolute nonsense! Avoid at all costs.
