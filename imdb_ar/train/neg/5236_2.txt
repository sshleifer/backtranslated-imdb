I and my friends watched this movie about a week ago and I feel it is absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who will read it) that this film is not only in the worst five films I've ever seen but actually has the honor of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies but nothing beats that stupid. You can say I suffered from seeing it ... My only virgin is that we were waiting for a few hours and could not go anywhere else without freezing the buttocks. I do not recommend this to anyone. At first I thought we were watching some really bad porn movies but popped up after 10 minutes. It's not comedy, not drama, not action, not horror, it's just terrible!
