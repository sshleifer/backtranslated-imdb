I watched this movie last night after a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try to work continuously from who and who and what all this means, you hate this film. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the actors' roles in this film, moving the film from different stories and not allowing you to sympathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For those interested in politics and those interested in corruption in other governments of the world, this film is available. It may be very good, but for ordinary movie monitors, this film is awkward, and very tedious in some places, and will leave the cinema puzzled by your order and annoy you that you paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> See if you're ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or policy that interests you. Do not see it, if you love watching movies.
