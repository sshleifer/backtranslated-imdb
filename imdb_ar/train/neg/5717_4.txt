Stand up Nelly! I've heard a lot of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my go to the horror horror reviewers really found it disappointing. The man was right in the nose! This film was represented by pure amateurs. They did one thing, maybe two in each scene, it seemed that the film had burst. The script was also bad ... they had lines I tried to be unique but failed. A terrible failure. "Get meathooks off me!" Hey man, I hate it when the movies try to do it. This happens all the time with comedy ... but with a horror film and with less than average reps .... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel negative about this film is, once again, the dreaded representation. It was awful. Along with the little Asian man who worked as a stall. I thought it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 stupid idiots! T who are vacationing in Asia. And end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of the mafia that runs sex or slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching a person with bad diarrhea may be more fun and watching. The only reason this horror is due to murder. There was no trace of pessimism. <br /> <br /> I love many other horror lovers dying to get bloody little gloves on the subject. But unfortunately with a huge capital U, the film was incredibly disappointing. I enjoyed ankle rest and blood effects. Chicks were flaccid as well. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is the first length of Ryan Nicholson, and most of it fails. There is no denying that he has a sick sense of humor and horror taste. I pray that his next film does not appear like the other flick ... unless he tells us that this will be. Even after this frustration, I am willing to give Ryan another chance. From what I have seen from him, he is a true and faithful man of this kind. Good luck next time, because this was a bad news.
