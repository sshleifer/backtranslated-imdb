I have seen this film in the cinema for many years, and I was so upset by something that I could not see any virtues recaptured in the movies: Dennis Quid was filmed as a policeman who never smiles or smiles while his smile and smile are two of his brands. Danny Glover was portrayed as a bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination was not far enough to believe him in this role. Also, Jared Leito was as unreasonable as a former medical student. Tension was not there, because the killer was known too early. The final was not exciting or tense: no one around me cared what would happen next. All we can wait for is the end of the film. All in all, a disappointing evening spent in the cinema.
