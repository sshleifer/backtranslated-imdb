A famous but demure actor (Morgan Freeman) was not filmed four years ago. When invited to participate in a new project, his cousin is asked to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to discuss the work of the manager of a small supermarket. See the wonderful Spanish treasurer Scarlett (Paz Vega) and become attracted to her ability. His driver never returns to arrest him while Scarlett travels to the actor. But first she has a job interview for a secretary in a construction company and the representative helps her prepare; and then spend the afternoon together in a fun time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Baz Vega. However, the "10 elements or less" useless is very disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a story, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Baz Vega. In fact, nothing happens for 82 minutes. The open opaque conclusion is simply absurd, as Morgan Freeman returns to his silver spoon world and tells the simple worker that they will never see each other again. Was he afraid to have an affair with her and destroy his ideal world with his family? Or was it a struggle between the classes, realizing that his lavish neighborhood would not be enough for a simple worker of the lower classes? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mother of Astro M Menha Vida" ("Star of my Life")
