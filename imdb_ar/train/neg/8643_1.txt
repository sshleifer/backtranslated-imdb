Blair's Witch-War movie was a disappointment as far as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend on a good movie like "Once Upon a Time in America", "Redemption Shoshank" or "Enemy at Gates" (if you want to watch GREAT movie "War") etc. <br /> <br /> This film, if a baseball team, the major leagues were the top one and was a junior, then this film was a high school ball. Was filmed as if a high school drama club was filming with their old father's camera. Sure, they went to a hostile area (to make a film) but I do not call this brave, here we call this ordinary stupidity! This is passing along the way! Go now see it then tell me what you think.
