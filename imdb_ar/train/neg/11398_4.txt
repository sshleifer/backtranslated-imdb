I saw this film primarily to watch Brooke Burke (Jill), whom I met briefly in Los Angeles at a fashion show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of them, but I thought they were doing very well. Since she is a beautiful and ready-to-do TV hostess, it was not surprising. I left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not really sure of this kind of film, although I loved the actors that I felt were for the college audience. I tried to keep my mind open because horror was not my favorite type, but I felt I had gone beyond the gags. He seems to withdraw in some places, leaving you to speculate in some places about the powers possessed by the evil professor, and like many other films had an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> After writing a few texts, I know that much of this is difficult and may be due to personal opinions, the number of films I have seen and studied, and those that relate to them at some point. <br /> <br /> In short, I found it interesting, but not a satisfactory plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) came back through the gate in the end and kicked his ass for everyone, it would be a satisfactory ending and he would get a higher rating.
