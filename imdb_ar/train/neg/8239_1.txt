This is really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I have no idea how anyone has the audacity to launch this. <br /> <br /> Production standards are terrible. There is no claim here in the cinema. The camera work, programming, acting and sound are incredible. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done within 10 minutes, giving us time to watch it. The hysterical gang girls in the middle of this article do not enjoy any credibility at all. <br /> <br /> I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money at this address. It is truly outrageous. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
