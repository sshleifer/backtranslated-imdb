I'm a fan of horrible movies, anything cheesy and ridiculously down is my game so imagine my soul went to the local Rent Rent shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is very interesting, you know that no one in the world can succeed in something like that, but it should be bad. <br /> <br /> The boy, is he bad. After watching this horror film, I was speechless, literally. My friend and I sat outside without saying a word to each other for a few minutes, each of us thinking about the future of our lives after watching this film. I broke the frustrated silence with the words "... yhhhh ... what?" Yes, I am a charming person. <br /> <br /> Here's the "The Street Review"; there's no way, ever, in the "WTF" mode. Characters; no evolution, can be forgotten. Music; worse than porn. Vampires are vampires are they? The Living Zombies; <br /> <br /> In the end, everyone should see this film, frankly, it's so bad I long to see it again. So prefer yourself, watch and depression.
