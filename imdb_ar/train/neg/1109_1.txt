This is almost certainly the worst west I have ever seen. The story follows a particularly common formula in Western films and martial arts - the hero learns that the family / friends were killed, so the hero began to exact revenge, thwart the ineffective law, rescue the abducted girl and kill the arch-enemy expert in a brutal duel. This formula was often successful - otherwise it would not be - but Gunfighter is the most operational implementation you'll ever see. Simple and offensive scripting. This sounds like a secondary student wrote dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. Sound is bad. Sometimes it seems dubbed. Cinematography is lame, and sometimes the facades are just facades. The representation is pitiful. Sure, some artists can blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope that I will not see Chris Lebert again in his role; every time he says a line must be angry or moderate, he does nothing more than reduce his voice and seems just a child trying to act muscular. Speaking of Chris Libert, who plays the role of Hopalong, check out his colleagues (if you dare to watch this movie): he wears these new clothes that make him look like Roy Rogers than a hard-working cowboy and dirty. If you enjoy the stunning cinematic fare that just serves the imagined grandeur of Hopelyong Cassidy, get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
