I do not know what style Donald Sutherland is about, or his voice style, but he always seems to be acting behind a huge group of Kleenex. It's just ... I do not know, think? Sir-Nomi? On the meds? a stranger. <br /> <br /> However, I've seen the click again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I do not remember it ending anything like that. Bad end, too, because nothing is linked. What about the dead husband? Baby Spam (was the child called?)? Scotland Yard and military pursuers? I wish something wrapped around things and give some dramatic closures for all that, not just the big panorama. <br /> <br /> What is the woman who sleeps with a man who knows that she killed her husband? Even if she tried to calm Nidel's doubts about protecting her child, she always suffered from a headache. This last encounter made me feel very stiff and uncomfortable ...
