I have nothing to say but it was awful. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating mess. If some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, they may have to refrain from producing more of these films. There was at least one person left me curious. My only opinion. You had to think about what was happening in the film. You have to wonder what happened in the minds of the actors who made this film. Shuddered to think about the process of thinking and snooping that occurred in the director's mind. As reported by the humiliating mess. It is not even fun. As Ebert told Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good film, not a good story, and it's not even good. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
