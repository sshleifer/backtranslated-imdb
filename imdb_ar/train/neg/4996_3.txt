I really enjoyed the first half of this film, but, wow, you turned into a wheat, or should I say, "just plain stupid." This is just another example of old humor. Maybe it was funny in 1940, but not now ... not even soon. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to watch. I particularly liked the moment he began to shift from his boyish looks and his high voice in Busby Berkeley musical works to where his voices and voices mature too. <br /> <br /> Jimmy MacDonald was fine, but the rest of the actors who just played stupid characters, and the worst of them were the president of Raymond House, who did nothing but scream all the time. It was brutal to hear and was a big hit for the film.
