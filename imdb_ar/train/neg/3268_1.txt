It is a real challenge to make a film about a child devoured by wild canines and accused of murder by the mother, but despite all these difficulties, this succeeds. Meryl Streep offers her life performance, melodramatic, very tired but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even when the mother struggles with ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> If you do not have comedy movies about the babies you eat dogs you may feel uncomfortable watching your cup of tea, and yes, it's a strange choice for the subject of masquerade but very little of the film has nothing to do with it because it focuses on giving Streep a presentation Her Australian accent and facial deformities. <br /> <br /> Blaming media bias, excitement and ignoring truth or morality gives the film an opportunity to prove that these things are bad.
