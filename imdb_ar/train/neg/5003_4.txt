I'm embarrassed to write this review. I say this because those who read it will know that I sat in everything and this is embarrassing to recognize even strangers. But I just have to warn those who read the viewer comments on IMDb before they watch a movie they do not watch. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is an idiot. Acting is amateur. Orientation, camera work, collections, fashion, etc. are all second class. Let her go.
