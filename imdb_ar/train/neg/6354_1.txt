Woody Allen lost his ability to write dialogue or personalities that can be clearly distinguished from each other. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda", where all characters speak with Allen's false general evolution and have problems and perspectives that can not be tied to anyone outside the radius of the four blocks where Allen lives. They share the same exotic situation of buying millions of dollars in Manhattan apartments that seem to be designed by professional designers, regardless of their financial status or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only personal figure outside this murky mentality is Will Ferrell as a substitute for Allen Allen's Compulsory. Although not only did he make an impression of Ludi Allen (like Kenneth Branagh in the horror film), Veril lacks the magic or charisma that Woody had when playing the same role in his best films. <br /> <br /> The end result is another result in a series of bores immersed in themselves from a film director who has been trading his reputation for years.
