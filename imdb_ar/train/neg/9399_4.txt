The trio from Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Connie Island in the competition by Ginger Rogers, a gal who sells saltwater candy. With the outbreak of World War I, the trio enlisted and followed the ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is progressing as the three male antigens chew the scene with an overly cooked mono and a rapidly growing 'snappy' dialogue. The second half focuses on the sequence of events, where the US Navy follows both the German merchant cruiser and the U boat. These sequences are vivid and well illustrated, but in general, it is a long, unsatisfactory comedic drama with a flat end. For star lovers only.
