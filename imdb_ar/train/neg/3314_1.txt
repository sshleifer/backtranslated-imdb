By reading all these positive reviews I find myself puzzled. How many have benefited from what I consider a sadly bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen? There are many problems with the movie, which are already mentioned in some reviews. Simply put, it is an overburdened, overburdened mess, from opening credits to the broken end. <br /> <br /> While many characters are misunderstood and Ewan McGregor and Tony Collett do not perform well, the worst is Paltrow. I have enjoyed playing a lot in some roles, but here they are repugnant - they are self-conscious, noses, sluggish, and completely separated from their personalities and around them. A very disappointing effort - although Emma's idealism could not save this film.
