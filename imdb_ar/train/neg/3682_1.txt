I have seen thousands of films and never written a review, but the red eye I saw contrasts sharply with the incandescent praise published here that forced me to make my year in protest - and vote only as little as possible to make the medium closer to reality. <br /> <br /> This is a boring, boring bump of an unforgettable film only for his depictions of the terrorist target (a burly diplomat John Bolton - Esquire, a really great man, do not you know) and Dr. Phil (who learns his best-selling book, The only true red eye I have ever experienced is to rub my eyes with disbelief. <br /> <br /> Before you give up $ 10 or so for this movie, read "Quotations (from the trailer)". Above, ask yourself if you will really enjoy a film that has the most intelligent lines.Unfortunately, there is nothing better in this film. The scenario is full of contradictions such as the early detection of the heroine as the star of Lacrosse The university is questionable when the opponent later fights with a field hockey stick; the holes in the plot are wider than the first order (while the character development is strictly trained). <br /> <br /> Then there are moments of extreme irony, such as when the daughter of a high-level public official does not go directly to airport security at her first opportunity to warn them of an assassination plot against both the head of the internal security and her father. Or when that same woman runs the leather hell along the cold airport linoleum, twisting the arms and veins in her neck, while wearing a 4-inch dagger heel. Or when her stalker is chased by a suction wound in the trachea. Or when terrorists use a fishing column to bring their weapons from the bottom of the port. I am always willing to suspend disbelief, but I will not jump from 30.00 feet without an umbrella. <br /> <br /> The good thing I can say in this film is that it depicts women who are able (even in the form of Bembo) to deal with the most extreme emergencies - a kind of sexual portrayal that American films lack. Otherwise, this film never starts, and is no more exciting than the red-eye journey from Boston to New York. Do you remember the last time you got tricked by deceptive trailers and glowing praise - in this forum or anywhere else? This is one of those times. Wait for the Red Eye video, and you do not see it either.
