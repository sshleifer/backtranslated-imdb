The Sentinel represents everything about the spirit of Hollywood and the lack of sadness in the imagination that exists in many films these days. I can not think of one good thing about it. It's all generic, made in the factory, assembled so lazy that it really only exists as a commercial ad on how to make money from the unsatisfied and deserving public. <br /> <br /> A plot about a secret service agent that plans to assassinate Perez can be amusing. If handled by a good manager or care cast. Douglas is framed. Basinger is the first lady, with whom she has an affair (an unresolved conspiracy). Sutherland is the best friend who thinks he is guilty because there will be no film if he does not. The Longoria is nothing. A woman with a Maybelline fortune and ... that's all. I think there are fewer requirements for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in a film like this, the role of Prez itself is nothing more than a tool, a badly written code. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who brought us back to the equally pathetic SWAT movie in 2003, lacks mechanical guidance for any kind of signature and has all the visible evolution of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland seem incredibly committed and engaged in their performance from afar. Eva Longoria, the most exposed woman in the 21st century, is primarily attracted to desperate housewives. Their role is 100% useless and they do not do anything at all to promote the plot or add to their personal development. She barely has 2 lines to rub together. Marketing trick is really slut. <br /> <br /> If you are guilty of punishment, do not let me stop you. But time and money will not recover them.
