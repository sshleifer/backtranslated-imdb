CRIME BOSS manages Alberto de Martino. Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. Movie easily forgotten. Even though the sequence of a good car chase, this click appears to be floundering almost aimlessly. The new Don captures a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his life. Laws and ethics that are not written in the Mafia Act make it hard to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence generate the same thing in return. This can not be put on the shelf with real epic bands. Just the appearance of the film brings back memories of American fare. Even the famous American actor Tali Savalas can not enhance the level of this criminal drama. Antonio Sabato also starred: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lopegida, Sergio Tramonti and Piero Morja.
