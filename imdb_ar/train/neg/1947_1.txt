I am 17 years old and still love most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love the movies of the 1990s, and recently we dealt with one of the best direct offers of the Scooby Doo DVD shows for this decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I did not expect to be as good as they were. Anyway, go back to get an idea! I watched some episodes and I expected something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed at all. First of all, I hated animation. It was flat, pressed, and very morning - morning - cartoon - standard, easily the worst side of the chain. So some of the presentations I really hate I had a little better animation. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like foreigners. I missed Fred, Philma and Daveny, adding a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was very positive. I also hated the changes in the characters, because it seemed that instead of solving the puzzles, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes, something they could not do in movies or in Scooby-Doo. Where are you? Turns out. The melody was not good either, and I can not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and flamboyant. However, I admit that there is a very talented voice, they had better material, and they were not asked to look as different from original voices as possible, which they did, can I add it. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible, and I'm not trying to question it, that's what I personally feel. Bethany Cox
