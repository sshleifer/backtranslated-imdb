After seeing 10 minutes of this film, I was perplexed. I saw 30 minutes of my toes crinkling - I could not believe it: the film was very bad. In fact, it's so horrific, so much so that I had to watch all of it just for conviction (!). During that time, I realized that he reminded me of a group of alleged Danish comics from the 1960s and 1970s. Like this: Take a very famous comedy, make a scenario that puts this comedy in as many horrendous situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially individual lines), and spice up with a few pretty little girls in that movie, and you have success! I do not know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with a few great comedians), there seems to be a market for this type of film in the United States.
