If you've watched this movie, you know it! If you do not want to, and want to watch a classic BAD film, I suggest you watch this movie, because it ranks it down with the worst. So, if you really feel bored, rent it. If you want to know its shape, here's a simple summary: Adam Sandler was hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some models of Ms. Universe and five other people. Adam does not like how a passenger gets all the children, and tries to take the fake jokes. But wait! It's getting worse! You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
