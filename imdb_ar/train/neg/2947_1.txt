There were very few films I could not sit in. I made it through the ground battle field no problem. But this, this is one of the worst films ever produced. I understand Wobbie Goldberg tried to get to act on it. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed to have this in autobiography. I think it is a rare occasion when all the gag in the film falls almost on her face. Well, this is happening here. Not to mention the SFX, look for Dino with control cables hanging out of the back end !!!!!! In the middle of the film, I was still looking for a plot of land. I never found her. Save yourself the trouble of renting this and keeping 90 minutes of your life.
