This may have been based on historical events, and we know that TV drama makers took liberties to make them more dramatic - I can live with them - but they were done in a very bad way! I was surprised if there was a crisis in the air that showed how calm everyone was, and certainly someone might panic, what a smooth trip, no obvious inconvenience to passengers - come on! I'm not sure about the regulations. At the moment, some of the security things for airline companies seem nonsense, but why take off your shoes before the emergency landing? The common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! The footage of this huge plane that was landing on the distant airstrip was unconvincing and fake. In fact, it was a wonderful sight to be seen from the nearby ground, in this film it was disproportionate and seemed to be the model that probably was. The escape slats appeared at the front and middle emergency doors, but no one showed up out of front, although the drop was much lower. Captain returned to the plane after landing - why? This has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to running out of fuel, but nevertheless there must be some fuel flowing in the bottom of the tanks. The risk of explosion must be very real, but the evacuation seemed almost time-consuming, and everyone was standing at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting away as far as possible , I'm sure I'd do it. There were a lot of contradictions, mistakes and counterfeit actions in this. I'd rather see a drama representation in real time, with a realistic animation of the picture plane. It had the ability to be very exciting, but without doubt due to budget constraints failed, and made one feel that a plane losing all the engines was not a really big deal, and you would slide safely to a bit of bumpy landing, but no real risk! - The fact that of course be somewhat different!
