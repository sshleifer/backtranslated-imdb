The beautiful idea of ​​bringing many stars into one movie is fantastic. But .... too many stories, too short and really lacking any sense. There is no connection between the viewer. There were about 3-4 wonderful stories ... but these were 18. The frame reminded me of "all invisible children" - a film I liked a lot. In comparison, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks an interesting short story, which develops - beginning and ending. And lacks the theme that binds all these - children. I do not find Paris enough for a subject that links 18 short drawings. Maybe for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
