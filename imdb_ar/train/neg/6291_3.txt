I have recently been pleased to see the funny comedy "Party Party", one of my favorite new comics, and he laughs so it hurts a kind of film. So, of course, I wanted to see the sequel, hoping to have the same laugh, but instead, the Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation was produced by the American Pie Generation, tasteless and defeating the purpose of the hole in the first film. Yes, the first film contains nudity, but it does not appear in every scene. As the plot is exactly the same from the first, they are not always a complaint with me, but this could have been original. The only thing is that I am happy because at least no old actors from the original appear in this film, because it was supposed to be really cowardly or ridiculous. <br /> <br /> After just 2 months of dating, Ron and Melinda are all against her. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are very happy Bron, Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will take over. So they're going to Miami for the bachelor party weekend, and Todd will make sure he catches Ron in a way that makes Melinda change her mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation The couple laughs here and there, but most of all fails to deliver what the first film did. These men, Ron's friends, were more repugnant than their pet, except Seth, it was rather funny. The only beloved characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, anyone else gets your temper more or less. Want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's just the same, it's not trying to pretend it's a movie. Adhere to the original bachelor party, this is the movie that will make you cry out of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
