Wow, a film about politics in New York City apparently written by someone who did not set foot in New York City. You know that there is a problem when the credits stop at one moment and the film continues for another half hour. The characters are dull, the tone of John Cusack laughable, and the lines swing between boring and funny. Horrible movie.
