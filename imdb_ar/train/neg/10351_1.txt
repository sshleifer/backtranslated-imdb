This movie is barely followed by the story line. All the brilliant points in the book did not even exist in the film. It ended up being transformed into a "Crush" story from Disney's "Smash" between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad, and Hilary Duff was supposed to play her role, or one like her. This film was no more than an insult to the wisdom and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney can get away from making such a basic cheap delivery. If you have read the book before, I think you will agree that it can easily be converted into an "Lord of the Rings" movie. This movie was not able to use the title of Wrinkles in time. I did bad.
