This film won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past few weeks, I have seen dozens of candidates and recipients of this award 30 years ago and I think this movie may be the worst of them all - yet it was not just a candidate but it was just a Won candidate !! I assume that 1989 should be just a terrible year for this kind. <br /> <br /> The movie features a group of characters that are very similar to Uncle Festers. It seems that the simple articular numbers that are moved using motion stop animation. All are identical - with the same faces, objects and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They all stand on a large platform hanging, as if it were magic, in space. Each has a pole and also has a square on the podium. The platform begins to tilt slightly and in response the men move in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this boredom is when someone behaves very badly at the end, but it is not enough to make fun of watching it at the very least. Apart from motion animation to stop motion, this shortcut does not give anything that interests me .... was not among the candidates. They were very short and were much better than any of the candidates that year or the previous year. Pixar's success in previous years may have led to bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is extremely intelligent and very funny and it seems criminal to ignore him. Did not Pixar enter? This seems unlikely.
