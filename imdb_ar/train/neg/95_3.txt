You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you do not particularly want it, a man who comes out of budget horror after a budget scare to less than enthusiastic receptions. But continues to do so all the same. Even the unflattering praise that surrounds Camp Blood movies is reluctantly presented and I'm guilty of it like everyone else. Usually Brad can throw something interesting in the mix, an elegant idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the money to take it beyond the basic level, it depends on the audience to reduce it some slack and appreciate what it is and what it can be. Joe Hagerty performs a very funny and funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and is attributed to Sykes that he can feel that this strange role will work within the film. Coming to a multiplex is near you, in a parallel world, somewhere.
