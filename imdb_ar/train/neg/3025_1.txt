This movie is really bad ....... I do not mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Of all the films he has made, I only want the enemy of the state, besides being one of the worst filmmakers of all time. What struck me most was that Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) made this scenario. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but my involvement in this matter makes hope he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I like the new roles of Mickey Rourke but I can not even love him in this because of the horrible story and look of it. Do not get me wrong I still love Mickey Rourke but he committed some accidents in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Kira quietly, I think it's a little overpriced. I can not feel it in movies. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is bad. This is ....... 1/10 .......
