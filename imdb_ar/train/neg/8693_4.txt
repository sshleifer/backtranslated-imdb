I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have lived in Arlington for a few years. This film was as far away as it made it look like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of one scene! Texas does not have mountains. I think this happens when a movie is supposed to be filmed in Texas in Canada. Accents are also really bad. They must have representatives of Texas to play the parts. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. The film is really sad, because it is a true story. I pray that the murderer is found and convicted. The only good thing is that before her death, we now have Amber Alert to help find the missing children after they are kidnapped.
