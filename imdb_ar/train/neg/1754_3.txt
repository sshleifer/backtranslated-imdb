Why should Marie and Roda dates be so tired? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the presentation and the original characters? The characters were silly and non-monotonous daughter. Why can not there be girls who like their mother on television? It makes sense that Mary will leave Minneapolis, and Roda will return to New York City, but why can not Phyllis or Soo Ann Nevins be guests? It seems just a pathetic way to remember these wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Roda together of course, but it could have been better and much better. Well, there were Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, and Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, and we hope Mary will get better next time if she comes back to the old, old Mary Richards visit again.
