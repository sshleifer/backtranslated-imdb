Because 99 out of 100 times, producers have lied through their teeth (or anyone else) to your horse to rent or buy * controlled by mercy *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama Cinema proved the truth again with the release of "Feeding the Masses," an entry that may be good faith but somewhat incompetent in this type of zombie. People, this is not just a low-budget film industry, it's a very low-budget film industry by a group of people who - I'm sorry, know that they have families you love - will never be in a variety in any big fashion. This is a particular pitcher baaaaaaaaaad mooin, not only because it is cheap. <br /> <br /> Acting is modest, but I do not blame actors; they have no direction. They did not have any direction because the script was a half-baked zombie fantasy without any sense of real cinematic stories. The characterization is weak at best, not because of weak dialogue and special direction. Have you mentioned that the script and the trend are very lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great personal moments, nothing. The full premise of the government's suppression of the media is shattered by the "gaping commercial" gap and a sensational story that defies rational analysis, shame and shame to its ridiculous end. Master fields will not be happy. <br /> <br /> How can the government suppress the reality of a vicious coma epidemic when the reality is obvious everywhere? Why do they give it more than just a quick try? On this day and the age of mobile phone cameras with wireless access, what would they hope to achieve for more than a day or so at best? Now, if they cover something, like their guilt .... But "feed the masses" never explores these possibilities. Instead, it focuses on tampering with bad events and the exploration of laughter and / or importance, and the prayer of its audience will not notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film making equipment. Has anyone in this film got a paycheck? I hope the actors have done it, if only because of their wasted time in professional blind alleys like this. At least, technicians have gained some legitimate practical experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie lovers will find little to take advantage of "feed the masses". Tightness is tamed significantly because there are no balances of its rank, and there is no distinct characteristic set or memorable effects. They all forget the prominent, in fact. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even junk like the Australian stillbirth "Undead" was miles away from "feeding the crowd". Sorry, guys, go back to the drawing boards and take deceptive marketing with you.
