Warning: Potential spoilers (You do not have to pay attention, too, sorry for the initials.) <br /> <br /> Starting with the unnecessary dramatic sound that increases the annoying talk of nonsense, it continues with unnecessary nonsense and drama. This is bad but strictly. <br /> <br /> We know that traveling to space is a risky project. There is a complex system with many malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms, and so on. Unexpected things must occur in environments that are largely unknown. They knew things could get worse. In fact, an error has occurred. It is called learning. Granted, the Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards and there was tremendous political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology in the job was impressive. <br /> <br /> Various errors / comments I did not even see up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon made a speech in the event of an error. Well Duh. That's what you've done. It was the height of propaganda war, after all. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives the green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 may explode. (This is only "implied", though.) Yes, that's why they left people and the press watching in almost real time. <br /> <br /> 3) The capsule expulsion will not work. Like it did not work at the time when the chimpanzees were in it. Who survived? When the test was launched and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed in the parachute. There's a video from it, maybe you can find it on youtube or at least search for it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One of the people interviewed said that an explosion would wipe out a good part of Florida. I can only assume that it is meant as an exaggeration, because if it is not, I'm just annoyed how I can make a mistake in this mistake. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was then primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware is used today, and the reason is that it should not hang. The thing is worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built on relatively large components not prone to radiation. (The plane itself must be manually experimented anyway, so the complex routing system like B2 will not work.) What is the use of "TV screens" instead of "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, TV screens have been produced and are produced with a much higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object is not part of the rocket, it could be just one thing." We see where this happens. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not part of the missiles? At least the interviewee explains that if something is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) It seems as though the radiation flakes for landing were actually her hull. Making it thinner than the space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's nearby death during a training trip is footage I appreciate; I have never seen him before. As I said, any technique can be obvious, especially if it has not been adequately tested because, as you know, it is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The contradiction in the downward downward trajectory (because of irregularities in the intensity of the moon) at any time seriously threatens life. "Fifteen seconds of fuel", which was, in fact, "Fifteen seconds of remaining fuel before having to thwart the mission and return to the unit of command." <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" usually leads to disaster. I really do not know how to put it more simple. However, this is a prime example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts wandering around aimlessly like a cute child, followed by the voice that tells us the reason for this strange behavior is "now detectable." Turns out he was walking around and wandering aimlessly like a cute kid. Things are fun. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that during re-login, each connection was lost. This phenomenon is completely natural and was known at that time because it is impossible to circumvent contemporary technology. Again, the danger of this is implicit, but very deliberately. There was never a shuttle lost in the same space, while the acoustic receipt offers this "truth" as evidence that Apollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was about to lose, but the two real disasters occurred during take-off and back, respectively. In any case, comparing the shuttles with Saturn missiles is good ... well, well, just stupid. Even ignoring this, it appears that the shuttle's successful missions were not of interest to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What happened in hell with a UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. Unless it is assumed to have been created for entertainment purposes and is aimed at a specific audience (which appears to include people who do not know anything about history, science or letters). <br /> <br /> Even the point of the film is somewhat ambiguous. Fishing phrases such as "cover up now," "publicly disclosed here for the first time," appeared, but the film does not blame or offer a lesson or anything, which can be expected from a movie that has been emotionally done. In the good old tradition of excitement, there are many interview footage and the recording of fragments that are often out of context or with people we know nothing about except the "NASA scientist." Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the quest? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the film again? Oh yeah, this point. <br /> <br /> In short, in addition to being unintentional or inaccurate, it is not even good entertainment. Believe me, I'm a man who enjoys his kind documentary films; this film is not funny, clever, weird, nothing.
