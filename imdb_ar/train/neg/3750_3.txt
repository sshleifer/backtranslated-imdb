Finally, I took a look at Lynch's experimental test after a short period of waiting for a long time .... Unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for Lynch's hardcore fans, I have found that this is really boring .... <br /> <br /> Nothing happens, there are long, painful and painful periods where nothing happens, long and monotonous letters where nothing is said and the whole thing ends With no knowledge of the viewer, or care, what the hell was everything, what happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> There was a hint of Mulholland Drive - the blonde girl, the girl Diane and Rita-esque, and the Lost Highway moment with hints of some important events that have happened but can not be talked about clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this is very interesting and very boring, nothing happens, it is very forgotten and I think I will delete it from my computer and forget that I ever saw it. Sorry David
