This film does not deserve the film that was filmed on it. The dialog box is flat, filled with overly clich√© fonts and delivered by amateur actors who seem to be reading a script for the first time. Shaky and fragile film style is a cheap imitation of the visual effects of "The Ring" style. The characters do not behave as the average person does. For example, a character looking for her twin sister in her house is forcing her way through the front door, crawling around the house with fear and crying, and she does not even call once her sister's name to see if she is at home. What? You think she has buried her sister just instead of looking for her. The way a lot of past memories of her childhood. Too many unnecessary past footage is a typical sign of an amateur director. It's really funny to watch many shots of a woman driving down the street, up the aisle, just around the corner, here, there, side view, now a front view. Enough already. Do you think you're seeing a Solaris TV ad! Awesome movie. 0 out of 100. I really feel sorry for anyone who spent money making this movie or watching it.
