The lame plot and the two-dimensional scenario make the characters look like cardboard clips. Needless to say, this made it difficult to feel sympathy for any of the characters, especially the preacher; he acted and acted more like an animator. In short, I think you can say that it was on par with the typical television drama. It uses only all cliches in the book. The classic tormented musician who wants to go out and play salsa. His fiancé fiancé was dealing with the anti-bean character she did not like. I will not list them or it will be a spoiler because I will give the whole plot. The dance was okay but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tight. I saw him on YouTube. Thankfully I did not pay good money to see it in the theater. I'm still a little surprised by the wonderful comments this film has made.
