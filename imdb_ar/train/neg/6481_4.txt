Since Little Mermaid was one of my favorite movies for Disney when I was young, I was curious about her sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animation feature with everything high quality, great music result, and aimed at the general public. In contrast, Little Mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children, because it automatically reflects the child's self-perspective, music is more fragile and less exciting, and the end looks like a holiday. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when the child Melody is introduced next to Ariel from the family. Suddenly without any visual signals to help the drama, the giant tentacle stuck baby. I laughed, wait a moment, it is not funny, the child is under attack! Well, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and spontaneity robbed a possible drama because it happened very quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout this feature, Melody looks above humans, and what I defend is how most children perceive themselves. It is clear that this quality in Melody's character finally emerges when Morgan fights without an inch of fear on her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melody suffers from a lot of Ariel's problems, except the opposite. It turns out that Queen Ariel resembles her father by restricting her from the ocean, while King Triton inspects Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody both revolt against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music moves more emotionally in the first. This series contains a collection of songs, but there is not much orchestral work. It's great for young people, because it does not take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and brilliant. The sequel to the sequel with the song Bouncy and everyone playing in the water. It's definitely more targeted for children, because instead of being a grand ending and leaving you blown away, this end makes you think, "It's time for rest!" In the end, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them lighten up.
