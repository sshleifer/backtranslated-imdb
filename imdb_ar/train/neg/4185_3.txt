I give this movie 3 because it is worse than the Worship movies that deserve 2 True. Do not you make sense? Well, it is not necessary to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase it, an unbelievably stupid plot, where cowboys in space (complete with cowboy hats) are racing the space race of a vampire and a moron. who is this? The only good thing about this film is Natsia Malthy, with her amazing Norwegian beauty. God, I hope Michael Ironside and his brother Delois stop accepting stupid roles in stupid movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr Ironside from a lot of movies, I've worked in 164 films in this history !! It is true that he rarely played a major role, but he still!
