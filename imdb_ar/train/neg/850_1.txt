This must be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little boy is strange and they move to the hotel because his father is responsible for it. We find that the child has a gift, and "shining." This gift is never about anything but making the child look great. Then the film becomes more boring and boring until the man is finally mad. Goes in a state of agitation to kill the child and his wife because ... well, he feels so. Why does he do that? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the tub. The man accepts her and realizes that he accepts a dead body, and that's disgusting. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and hits an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black man's car and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this falls directly into this category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except for Jack Nicholson, a good actor), the plot is crooked and fits the description of vomiting, the end is very predictable, and the story is slow, tedious and boring. This movie is very exaggerated. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm surprised that they got such a high rating on IMDb.
