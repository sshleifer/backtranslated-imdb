It is not a film, but a simultaneous set of theatrical performances that were part of the British invasion, which followed the Beatles' dynamic approach to the music world. Some of these acts did not produce a big splash on this side of the pond, but many did not. Featured: Herman Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and Dacotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, animals, and of course the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's great fun watching these small works before honing and honing their actions.
