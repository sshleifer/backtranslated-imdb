Come on, what's the deal with this offer, Power Rangers anyway? I've always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan better, took what was wonderful in Japan and turned into one of the most absurd and senseless excuses in the history of the gaming business! This offer is useless at all. <br /> <br /> Bad hair styles, bad costumes, earrings, etc., all ridiculed in the 1990s from stupid, loose and skull, to "duhs", of the main actors, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberley, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan, then Disney bought the rights of this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to re-run this show on Disney Channel and the like. <br /> <br /> All I can say again is give me a break!
