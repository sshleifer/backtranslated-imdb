This must be the worst, I mean the worst biker movie ever! This says a lot because the stink line is long and smells! <br /> <br /> Now at least we know what happened to Jennifer after she was rescued from Gilligan Island! Tina Louise, who was scared of appearance (perhaps she was afraid someone would see this mess!) Is a stranded car driver tormented by the most disgusting motorcycle gang in the film's history. But, do not worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as his hick doctor comes to save! The prisoners! crush! bubble! Toledo Holy Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points in this "bomb" are some nice women, some laughable scenes of laughter, and Tina Louise is still exciting!
