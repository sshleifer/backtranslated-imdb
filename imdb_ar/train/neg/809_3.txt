I was expecting something small from the "K-911", I mean it looked like a nice movie I could get. I always love comedy movies dog. But it looks like it was supposed to be a Jame movie, not Jerry Lee. The plot was very lame, and love interests did not really have chemistry at first. Not to mention that it seems that James has a complete sexual view in the film despite the fact that the writer was not walking in that direction. James has really put me into more than half the film. The dogs were the real stars, and this is very sad because they glowed the actors. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad I'm not just on IMDb who agreed that this movie was too stupid. But it is hoped that James will realize that his brother Jim is a talented, not a crime, but not everyone can be his star brother. Do not you wish Ashley Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
