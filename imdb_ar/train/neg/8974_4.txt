This film, I would not call it "film", was basically about anything and was mostly working in popular works at the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (the goal of the pun), and this film gave troops and our fans a treat. <br /> <br /> But let's have something more. I love seeing young rich friends on drums. The music was good all the time. <br /> <br /> But one after the other progresses quickly. <br /> <br /> I did not even know Zero Mostel! So if you're one of the "greatest generation", they say, you'll definitely enjoy this movie ... <br /> <br />.
