Roy Rogers and his company are trying to bring life back to "Sintown" - it's a ghost town that could flourish if silver mining succeeds. Andy Devin (on behalf of the "cookie") is distasteful. Jane Fryzy (as Carol) loses a piece of her bites on Mr Mr Rogers's sharp. Foy Willing and Riders of the Purple Sage (or is this singing?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and Sons of Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the films of Laurel and Hardy) adds to the "teasing" look of the Grand Canyon Trail. The bulk floorboard provides a winning comedy performance. Mr. Devin Baughl kicks. There are vital human offerings, too - but the material is not great. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
