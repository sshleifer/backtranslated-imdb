Do not expect much from this movie. This film is in many ways similar to a film starring Doris Day in 1956, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was a flight attendant in those days, landed by plane after her confused husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. It has done a much better, and more convincing, job than Kim Agha, who controlled the 747 and managed to land without much help from the watchtower. I know a little about 747 planes, I used to be a flight attendant myself. As I said, do not expect much from this film, it was done with a cheap budget. The producers were cheap to use a plane bearing the name of an airline. Oceanic is the one name I have used several movies. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that manufactured the aircraft.
