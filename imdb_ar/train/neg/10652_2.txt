You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for the following: The Safety Pin Killer! That's right, in Killer Workout, a grumpy, angry film if you see anyone, the invisible killer sends his victims (or victims) with a very large safety pin. It is a strange choice to make sure what kind of thing deserves explanation. Of course, the film never tries to explain where the killer got something like that. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the aerobics gym is being besieged by a crazy assassin and every suspect. In fact, the film gives little evidence of the identity of the murderer. Every person in the film is a potential murderer until he is killed. And because almost everyone but the killer ends up, it is really just an extermination. <br /> <br /> It is strange that at the time the name is completely shut down, the aerobic classes continue seriously. In fact, there is nothing capable of stopping dancing. While three men are killed in the next room, the exercise continues. Death is not even a factor; one person dies, but is still seen prominently in later sessions. David Pryor knew what he was doing when he was called Killer Workout, not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> The policeman's chase, an explosive tanning room and hundreds of shots of exposed meat are thrown at women. Like the woman trapped in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Keller's exercise. Finally, fortunately, the END flicker on the screen. what happened after that? Got it, screenshots of working women. Can not stop them until the end of the movie! <br /> <br />
