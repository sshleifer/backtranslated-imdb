I was deceived to see this movie after reading a positive evaluation from another website and the guy filmed me !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the shelf / I did not want anyone to see me. Then another 10 minutes to build the courage to move it to the counter and use the real money actually to rent it. I thought all my tension would pay off when I got home and watch the movie B / C review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! If you can achieve this during the first hour of the movie, it's lucky you B / C is not even then the film turns into a horror. Do not care about this person, it's better to see "fog falls"
