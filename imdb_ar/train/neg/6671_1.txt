I felt that this film started well. Instantly acted and felt at each personalities position, although the real family unit was not fully disclosed. We never got enough information about the father until we really felt his pain because of his full involvement or in preparation for his hostility with Tobe. I mean in one scene to see him admire it because of the intensity, and in another scene is about to raise her head. Another problem with the film was that it had receded and all of its focus was finally lost, and I begged it to end. You should never get an automatic rating of only 7 or higher for any long-term movie, and a painful ending. We are looking at quality film experience. In the case of this film, the end too bad I seriously thought of going out of the theater. He pulled me out of this movie and then took me out.
