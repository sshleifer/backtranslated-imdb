If I realized that John Wayne was in this film, I would not have seen him. It is humiliating for the Japanese, a pity for Hollywood and embarrassing for anyone who thinks. But then, most John Wayne films like that. Hollywood in the 1950s still believes that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The film deals with the isolation of Japan in the 19th century. Perhaps it is Hollywood that must be isolated. To put it as briefly as possible, this film is horrific from the adventures of Genogistic (kind of Madama Butterfly with bad music).
