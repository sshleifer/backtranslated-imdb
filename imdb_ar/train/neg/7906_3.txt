Korman does not knock because he was so excited at Carroll Burnett's show. He has also been good at playing secondary characters in the films of Mel Brooks (which comes to mind "extreme anxiety"). However, he is not a person who can carry a movie in duel roles. This is basically a knockoff "Gremlins", following the tradition of such films as "Creatures" and "Ghoulies". It's not a very good knockout, on par with "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone because there is nowhere near the dark as this movie got. In fact, this light is light and humid, and unfortunately many jokes end flat. Although I gave it three points to get a score, only that is because there is a film that represents the worst Grimline knockout. If you see Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know what I'm talking about ... "Hobgoblins". This man contains a man who finds few creatures somewhere underground (I have only ever seen this film a long time ago, so I do not remember everything clearly) and he starts with enough affection. However, this creature soon becomes unfriendly, and of course more is produced, this is the film. Mistakes more than visits in the jokes section, as it is really sad to see Kurman playing the role of the evil brother. It's best to skip this, but you may want to check it for just kicks.
