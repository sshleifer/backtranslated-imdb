After I enjoyed Jan Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest has reached its peak, so I tried to sit on a second series walk around investigating the death of a knight - but I could not get to the end. Arthur, who was filmed in a great way in a magazine magazine, either wants to make a living from former husband William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I never felt it because the character is just a series of anecdotes (she is the kind of heroine that tends to comic curiosity, As soon as she is inside the morgue - like all the women in this 30-comedy comedy, she is afraid). William Powell is said to have spent a lot of time working with Miss Arthur, but you will never know that from the end result; they seem awkward beside each other, reluctant to joke. The actor who plays the role of Powell's secretary is painful, and the audience's laughter stops uncomfortably.
