Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy shy video photographer and an elusive struggling artist, both living in Big Apple, and developing an unlikely love story with the help of an online dating site. This in itself is not unusual, but what is their contact method. In the introduction to the pronunciation, they take to writing notes and communicate later through the video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the relationship of the creator (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), who take the leading characters as well as writing. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot, and document, the film spreads in the wind with an unspecified structure located between narcissism and self-indulgence. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, the chapter breaks apart and their intriguing form of communication deteriorates as the couple face hardship. Focusing only on internal conflict, or the scourge of the relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant story that is neither original nor influential. This could easily be circumvented by adding the sublayer and the external conflict, and the third act, where there is none, is simply a monodrama montage that does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> What is more strenuous is the decline of the film from story to reality suddenly ends with an open and unsatisfactory ending. This was all great and exquisite, but there is no question and no meaning to discover or contemplate it. <br /> <br /> (In a side note, the film contains beautiful animations and live, moving music, one of the most exciting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the movie and make a decision yourself .
