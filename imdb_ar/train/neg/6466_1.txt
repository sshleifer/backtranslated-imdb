Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in acting when he filmed the film. His performance as "Swede" is the worst in his career, and that is exactly what he intended to be. He does not exaggerate. Instead, he simply behaves in a strange way and makes fun of his embarrassing narrow surroundings. Perhaps the scene in which Brando climbs on the toilet stall is the worst and most entertaining moment in the history of cinema. When we see him head down in the toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in A Streetcar, Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his last years. Are you tired of film work? Do you just like a complete fool and utter the same? I think we will never know. But this film is a fascinating study of what misconduct is all about. <br /> <br /> In that memo, he watched his veteran acting colleague Donald Sutherland struggling to present his lines, embarrassing himself for agreeing to take part in this farce.
