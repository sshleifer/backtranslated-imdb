Spoilers? Maybe some details, but nothing very relevant plot. Not as if it mattered with this film. <br /> <br /> Air Rage is blatantly rupturing the air infiltration hypothesis in the executive decision. The Ice-T team leads a team of four elite commandos dressed in loose-fitting black shirts that we can only imagine hiding invisible body armor because their stupid tactics (like those used by third graders when playing Star Wars on the pitch) and a barrage of fire . <br /> <br /> The most I enjoyed in this click was the use of similar representatives. You will immediately get to know Cyril O'Reily as someone who was once acting in a movie you really liked, although long ago you would not be able to put it (Burke was). Here Cyril plays an appropriate role in the character of Bill Paxton. Most Hilarious is Gil Gerard, an obese man who is so obese that she will never recognize him as Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his moderate heroic past, Gerrard gives us a remarkable performance for the strong, vulgar character of the person, which was clearly imagined by John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a great hybrid-like performance as a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, the representation of Ice-T has deteriorated markedly. It does not behave as much as it would line up the lines it might have already saved. <br /> <br /> An element played in this movie is a CD containing confidential information. It is carried by hand, and it appears to be incredibly unencrypted, despite the security aura of Gerrard's character in the NSA. What a joke. I strongly doubt that the information alleged to be on the CD will be all assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Although he was in a closed plane without silencers, the shooting was as loud as canned air, causing a fire person to stumble, so there was no Foley budget. A variety of weapons is very funny. The use of the coffee hostess revolves around the most realistic reality of violence in the film. When you intuitively take a mini-Uzi pistol, which must be one of the worst gun designs ever, this is very stupid. The real elite team will carry the MP-5s for this kind of thing or maybe the SOCOMM .45s, or even the Hi-Powers custom if they are a really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if it's a new school ... Lame 92Fs standard issue is not entirely believable, Where they lost most of their calm after the first deadly weapons. The bad guys, presumably a soldier of sorts, have a diverse mix of tampering, such as the Uzi mini pistol mentioned above and the Tec-9 with an uncommon gun extended functional barrel that is not a muffler. <br /> <br /> There was one touch of realism that I wanted to correct for other reviewers: the flight attendant and Ice-T reduced the plane to 10,000 feet for Air Breathing before opening the door. I also have the impression that the flight attendant was not able to close the door, and they basically abandoned this point. As far as the landing, there was no mention of the plates until about two seconds before landing. sigh. <br /> <br /> Only Danger Dukes are coming out of Roscoe B. Coltran at the "pass" can be ashamed of this film to use stock footage. Obviously they chose the stunning SR-71 (and retired) because they could not get the F-117. Apart from the fact that they were already exposed to violence in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth plane in the sense of B-2, and that its range is empty at the point ... Well, I'm not an expert, but I have doubts about whether It will be invisible on the radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the frequent references to "F-15s" when they were presenting the F-16s were laughable. The 747 details were very stupid. No airline will put that few passengers on a 747, let alone everything else was stupid. Be aware of using exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> F. What a program. Catch it on stars or something. Do not pay to rent them, but watch it for laughs. In competition for the worst film ever, there is No Holds Barred, which at least enjoys some originality.
