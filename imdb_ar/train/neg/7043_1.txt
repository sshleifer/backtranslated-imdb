I was ready to laugh throughout this movie as an experience at the Mystery Science Theater, but it was boring. The producers seem to have a lot of enthusiastic friends who are cyclists, and from there they decided to show a movie. <br /> <br /> It is often inaccessible. Lots of footage of bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played over and over again. Unfortunately, Rene Harmon is barely in the film. Harmon probably was activating things. She may have had other obligations on the day he was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, the drivers scare a small town. Battles, murder, a cowardly policeman, a clumsy mechanic, etc. One driver always wears a soccer helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The text has nothing to offer. One scene shows a biker attacking a woman, yelling at the lady "You're all the same! You're all the same!" We returned to the scene a minute later and announced again "You are all the same!". Could the writer think of something more creative in saying? <br /> <br /> In the end, the bad guys are killed. We also know that the wedding was canceled between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie. Susie will go to college, and suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still going on (but with a different bride). End.
