My life revolves around saving animals. I do volunteer work with Save the Cats. I am a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal even to keep my life. I can not even kill a spider, I've put it in the open air. The scene in which the children throw rocks at the bird to die, with the participation of Sonner in an attempt to be accepted by other children, has made me sick and has been following me ever since. It simply convinces me that people are pathetic in their need to accept. The end - adoptive parents embrace sooner - does not replace the cruelty to animals. Why would anyone want their child to see this film?
