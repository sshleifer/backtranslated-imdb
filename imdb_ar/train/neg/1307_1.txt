This was really a very bad film. I am a fan of Italian horror, Argentino, Mario Bava, Folsi, and yes, so our close friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out well. I found that the first two "demons" were very interesting - they were so bad they were fantastic, but the film was so bad it was really bad. She is very boring, and the story does not go anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping the husband and the little screaming pain in the *** wife drove me crazy, there was not enough story devoted to Ogry who was probably the best actor in the entire film. I turned him off about three quarters of the way because I felt so bored! Do not care.
