I grew up watching and loving TNG. I recently finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have increased my sense of disgust with this episode, because the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be more explicit. The idea may be good if used as an opportunity to further expand the personality of Riker, a method that may have been addressed on VOY. They can have memories that will be "new" to the audience, rather than just renewing old software clips. The internal and external transformations between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode begin in the form of cliches at first, and become unbearably fast with the persistence of the tired style in appearance. The bar is nothing worse than an episode at all.
