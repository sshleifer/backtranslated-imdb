I'm the man who usually keeps his opinions for himself, but I just came back from this film, and I felt I had to express my views. Let me start by saying that I am a fan of horror. But what makes a horror film? I certainly love to see even a small part of good writing and personal development. I know they often lack horror movies, but it seems that a concert tonight did not show any effort in this circle. After that, we all love the thrill. This is on the edge of your suspense seat with unpredictable surprises. Unnamed: Yeah, night prom was none of that! Of course, we love a terrifying killer. Night concert be it? No, he has a nice boy with a nice knife. And when everything else fails ... at least the horror is pleasing to guilt to make it fun like gore gore gore and nude scenery! Yes, well, when you have a PG-13 horror movie like Prom Night, they leave these things too. So with all these missing elements, I ask .... Is this still considered a horror film? Both. I call it more than a comedy. The people in my play were laughing more than this, and then they were when I saw "Semi Pro" which was supposed to be actually a comedy (which was also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up a new horror. All the good horror movies that were made in good ol days were re-produced to the movies so movie studios could reap money. The people I went to see with them did not even know that it was a remake! Which made me crazy! I wonder what will happen when there is no more movies to remodel ??? Where does horror go ???
