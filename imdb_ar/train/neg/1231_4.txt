Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a high-class housewife who lives in private suburban condominiums with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Scheffer). Della pays all attention to the twins, neglecting their home and appearance and upsetting Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, drive to the local business center at night to buy wrapping paper for gifts, and find no parking space. When you see an old car parked on two sites, it leaves a message to the owner describing it as a "selfish shuffle". When the mall closes, the Della is suspended by the old car driver and is threatened with four kicks. Chuckie (Lucas Haas), American Africans Huey (Jimmy Starr), Chinese American Fing (Leonard Wu) and Latin Thomas (Louis Chávez). When protected by the security guard of the mall, he is shot by Chucky, and Della hurries her car as she tries to escape the criminals. But her truck crashed near a forest while the gang chased her. She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood, fighting against the gang for survival. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I watched the video "While You Were Abroad" and I was keen to watch a DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I am very disappointed by this vulgar and unreasonable collection of cliches. Della Myers is presented as an unsafe and neglected housewife and not as a wife; motherhood is her only concern for the concept of her family. She was chased by four average criminals but defeated by a tool box that appeared to be Batman's belt. So, the plot is very silly. The gang of criminals consists of the cliches of favorite American films, where Afro-Americans, Chinese-Americans and Latin Americans are politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent representation, but their children are younger than fifty-five. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Acquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While Out")
