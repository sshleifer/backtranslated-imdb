What did Ireland do to photograph distributors seeking to represent the country in an annoying way? This film begins as a prelude to film students about Irish movie collars: uninvolved priests, spitting before shaking hands, livestock breeders in the town, and cycling in rural meadows against popular folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes clear that the main subject of the film is the Daddy-O of Irish clichés - religious strife. It's about a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic father is being taught, which seems like a reasonable enough desire, but not for the villages of the county of Wexford in the 1950s that she has to live with. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, she decided to go to Belfast and then leave for Scotland, where a few clichés were renovated. While she was there, her father (who looked like George Lucas horrifyingly) and his family came to the county house, which became very bad. I will not give up the end, not because I think that people should go to watch this film, but because it is not very fun. One of the problems in the film is the central character: we are supposed to sympathize with her but we instead urge her to have a life. The villagers are shown to be fanatics who must stand in front of them, but the trauma of your children seems to be an inappropriate way of doing so. In addition, he bears the burdens he swallows horrifyingly when he tries to compare the current peace process in Northern Ireland: her lawyer told the woman that she "must set preconditions" for her return. The film is said to be based on a true story, but its themes have been dealt with in a more creative way, and to a lesser extent the use of clichés that have been penetrated in the past.
