My dear, what a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Production was cheap and very bad ... Remember a snapshot of the movie "Natural", where the lightning struck the tree (leaving a glowing trunk) making Roy Hobbs make the bat from? Well, the producers of this film used the same scene as a scene scene where a tree branch rushed into the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid for using The Natural footage, or were they just hoping that no one watching the movie would take it? <br /> <br /> Then in the end, they try to escape in the truck. Such as over-representation in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad film, a really bad film.
