With movies like this you know you'll get the usual ghost-related jokes. Eva as a very funny ghost. And other actors also do a good job. This is the direction and story that they lack. It would have been overlooked if the jokes worked better. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. I certainly laughed several times. Apart from the modern parrot, there was no ounce of creativity to be seen in the film. I blame the manager for not using the hypothesis because it involves full potential. Eva certainly has the comic skill to show more but she has not had the opportunity to do so. Overall this film is ideal for Sunday afternoon. Otherwise you can skip it completely.
