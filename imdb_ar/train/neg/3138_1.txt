I see people writing about how powerful this film is. It was terrible! The acting was substandard at best. I have earned a lot of money because teenage girls went to watch the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where did they get the hell? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about Titanic. Why sank, what was going through a lot of people's minds; maybe even small things the plot. Does anyone realize that some people did not board the ship because there was a fire on board before taking off? No, you do not because all you see is a rich girl who falls on a poor boy and paints her naked (did that deadly junk at least make a stupid mistake?). <br /> <br /> I cried during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling the ship. It looked like a pool of water! I think that this film has made all this money and could not make water from the ocean look real? Incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played on while the ship sank .. just silly. This was the worst film Pearl Harbor had ever surpassed in the "Nothing to Do" section.
