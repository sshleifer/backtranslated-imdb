This can be seen in several different ways. This movie sucks, good or quite strange. The third film may explain this film better. She has strange themes and only has a strange plot. So none other than Christopher will play in this no matter how bad or average or even how good it may be. <br /> <br /> The acting was what you expected, especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always loved so you know what you'll get out of but that's not bad. Christopher is always outside the wall. It's always fun to watch movies no matter how damaging they are. Comedy wise it's pretty funny. Of course this means that it contains its moments (although few) but it can skip a little here and there which makes me feel that the film is desperate to laugh but of course not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The directive was also moderate. Barry Levinson is a somewhat overrated director and really did a good job here. It seems that this film had a lot of potential and did not do much to reach it. Very average and it does not seem that much effort has been made in making this film. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to good comedy. This obviously means failure to write here. At best below average. Given that she had moments it was not too terrible. This is not a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it was not for Christopher and him and he had a stupid stupid ending I would give him a lower grade. He is always a character in his films. Stil This is just a weird movie that was destroyed with strange characters do not go anywhere. Not quite terrible but I do not really recommend it because it is a very forgotten film.
