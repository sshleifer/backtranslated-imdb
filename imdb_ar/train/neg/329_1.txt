First: I bought it from the video store. Second: I saw it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. V: Most of the aliens were lame. Last but not least: It is not only a bad film, it is a complete failure. <br /> <br /> I admire Adam Sandler despite this disappointing and forgotten film. I pity him because he was his first film. Even if you love Adam Sandler, do not bother watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, climb a yacht, and roll it out.
