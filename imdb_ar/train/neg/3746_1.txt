As hard as I can believe, with all the terrible reality that has been showing up there over the last few years, it should take the lead in the worst place yet. I'm still wondering if this is actually just a parody by the SCTV band. If Andy Kaufman is still alive, I'm sure he was behind this. Could the Rock Band descend less than INXS to do such a shameful thing? The hypothesis is simple and overlooked. The performance experience refuses a handful of karaoke to become the new lead singer of INXS, replacing Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). After eight years of no success later, the band performed a pathetic act by subjugating itself to the experience of a handful of talented celebrities to be the new lead singer of a 20-year-old band. So they recorded all those terrible singers (I thought American Idol had a share of doozies) who were making terrible renditions of every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. They then shortened INXS members who seriously discuss the merits of each candidate. You can see the best rock artists (and most authentic) in any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It contains all the usual unusual elements in every other realistic view. Participants are actually lame, lame interviews, lame host / emcee, lame "judgment" on presentations, lame boot from one participant at the end of each show. Can these offerings become more predictable? It is clearly a propaganda ploy on the part of the band; the final moments of hope in reviving the lost stardom before finally burying it into oblivion. Michael Hutchins, if he had any dignity when he was alive, must roll in his grave. Not that INXS was a great band at all, but I had no idea it was pathetic. If INXS at all represents what Rock & Roll has become, this show will be the ultimate proof of rock and roll death.
