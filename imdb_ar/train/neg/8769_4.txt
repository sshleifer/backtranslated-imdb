This was a film I had hoped to propose to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie until the end, I knew I could not even watch the dreaded thing to close it. You are sure that the actual war did not last long. Others will try to question the patriot I criticize for such a film. But you can not go from watching Save Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the difference in the budget of the film or the audience - these do not prevent the director from making an intelligent film. The length of the film is not too bad and the fact that it is repeated - they are still attacking the same hill but they call it different names. I thought the LOC had terrible terrain - this hill looked like a backyard. Personal development sequences (memories of the past from the soilders, and back to their last moments, before being published) must be all around the film and not just in one long memory. To this day, I have not seen the end. But there was a much better film (do not say too much) called Border.
