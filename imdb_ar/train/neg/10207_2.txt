Alfred Hitchcock devised whatever kind of excitement you could think of: he set such high standards that any director making a suspicious film would compare. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the Bullock vehicle, all ideas, was almost everything in a classic Hitchcock "rope": the Taliban who committed an unjustified crime, the Nietsche philosophy, and the clues that the boys spread. Master was the first to transfer them to the screen. - Short film was a powerful reinforcement tour for installation. <br /> <br /> "Murder in numbers" does not happen in a single room, like "the rope." He is of the utmost originality, he digs two policemen against the evil little ones, and you never guess him. Quite different: In fact, Bullock plays the role of a woman who lives like a man, and her shabby partner like an unknown girl girl. The boys' performance is not really clear, not good, says Edward Norton. In "primitive fear". <br /> <br /> Well, you know, the "rope" was very good ....
