I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Downer executed him brilliantly. Nor am I alone in the irony of Richard Leicester Superman 2 ... which brought us to the movie Richard Downer of the same film, unfortunately is still an abomination. <br /> <br /> Superman World is a world where the suspension of infidelity is required in powerful doses, but Superman 2 runs even further. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the text insulted the intelligence of the first row. In a sense, there is no conspiracy because characters do not have an absolute motive to behave the way they do, unlike the original supernatural man. With or without power, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is dealt with in the least believable way. There is a lot to criticize, so it will not bother me. I condemn this film ... The Lester control panel may have been more appropriate for the legacy text on which this film is based. Super deceptive bad.
