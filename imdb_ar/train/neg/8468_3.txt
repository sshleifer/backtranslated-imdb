"They are among us" is a weak scientific imagination at best. The average swamp acts at the bottom of this film. Many plot slots. Aliens who have come to Earth one way or another on a meteorite have been hiding among us for more than 100 years, but they need plastic surgeons to make them appear human. In their odd shape, they are supposed to have skeletons (which is why they need plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after closing the Blue Book Project, but was supposed to be an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to watch a foreign invasion movie, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see how it is done correctly.
