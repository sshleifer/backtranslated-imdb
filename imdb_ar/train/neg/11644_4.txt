Yes, I get the "Bassolini" and its environment, but at the same time, I feel that the "decameron" is pretty much overpriced and more annoying. Exaggerated because the so-called "realism" it offers (milling crowds, collapsed architecture, etc.) is engraved in the silly and foolish way in which characters behave. In the pursuit of realism, Pasolini has benefited from many non-actors, but her headlights and deer are painfully and painfully giving everyone a wonderful, elusive and uncoordinated feeling. Frankly, many people who do not recognize anything and who suffer from hearing impairment feel pain when looking at them. <br /> <br /> The "Decameron" written by Pasolini bothers me (at least at least) because of abnormal sexual content. Not because I'm gay or gay (I'm not), but because Basolini's focus on images and homogenous attitudes contrasts with the new reality he embraces in another way, it's unjustified and forced. One can hear almost say "Oh - you must stick a cute nude boy in this scene!" Sometimes, Pasolini seems to try to raise the corner of his thumb to the critics, and at other times because he enjoys this aspect himself, no matter what his audience may prefer. <br /> <br /> Of 9 or 10 different stories in "Decameron" Pasolini struck me as a failure Basolini Kasas, instead of being part of the new realism. He seems bored with every story, so he concludes it unconvincingly and without much conviction. Even the last line of dialogue in Pasolini in the film, which some people seem to find confused ("Why create a work of art when the dream is sweeter?") - For me, this just makes me wonder why Bassolini bother making a film if he felt that way? In my opinion, a much better film (and with more sexual content) is Fellini "Satyricon". It is full of people with strange looks and ridiculous attitudes, but it succeeds because of its speed, direction and powerful storytelling, while Decameron fails with the same elements.
