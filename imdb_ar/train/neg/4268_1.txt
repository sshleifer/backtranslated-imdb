I remembered this offer from when I was a kid. I could not remember much about it, just some simple things about characters. For some reason I remembered that it was really intense. It was really really early in the morning even in the PA. Finally, after looking at the Internet for a long time, I found a loop. The first episode does not say. Criminey! This show was terrible too. It was obviously made to show that the children were playing the laser card and had a wonderful time. The show begins with a bhodi li saying to his mother "My names are not Christopher, I am bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" We are then forced to watch the children playing the laser mark in the song "Loose Foot". Not just a little quick, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my mind hurts me just think about it. Oh, yeah, like I could not get worse, you can not even see the lasers from their guns. It seems like they are running around the entire song "loose feet". Later, after the arrival of the bhodi to space or anywhere at all, they have a hot laser gun fighting with the song "Phil Collins" su-suio. Ah, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... light shines !!!!!!!!!!!
