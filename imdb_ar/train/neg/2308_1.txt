Well, the box looks promising. Webby Goldberg stands beside Danny Glover making fun of the famous farmer and his wife's painting. You then divide this child into a DVD player and lose hope in less than five minutes. It's supposed to be a comedy. I must admit that I laughed once about ten minutes before the end. This film contains the following elements: Neighboring and subject to abuse, a legal trial boring, racist, talk of killings, death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you've never heard anyone's comments, please do so here. You can not even force yourself to watch this crap. crap! I said so, Crab! From there put a name on this should already sue.
