Oh my God. While the Chevy Chase and the SNL band recorded new record levels with graphic display format, this failed miserably on every level. Luckily Chevy barely in this at all and can not blame it on this absolute trip. It's very serious, too bad. While it was supposed to be a political comment on the United States at the time of its publication (1974), it is still not funny or noticeable. All graphics are very long, and any spelling effect they may have had all gone to the point of total boredom. Thanks to Chevy's first appearance and I'm happy to say that everything he did then improved. Avoid even if it's curious.
