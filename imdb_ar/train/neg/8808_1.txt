"Stunning" Los Angeles Times screams from the introduction of a DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such an unfortunate piece of crap had been unleashed. The film revolves around a group of girls suffering from a disease that forces them to become cannibals, killing innocents just to survive. Their skin shines throughout the film, and also see broken legs, headers etc. that are as convincing as the Fuzzy Felt collection of Halloween. There is a lot of terrible talk about some people, a bit of human food and some of the chieftain hunter who jails the skin patients mentioned in his wardrobe strapped to a chair, before stabbing them in the head and cutting them into pieces ... <br /> <br /> You can Get the picture. Given the lack of acting talent exhibited at all, and the unrealistically laughable predominance, what is the benefit of this whole farrage? Again when looking at the video box, the person in charge is the "Underground Cult Manager". Would it be like those strange religious communities where they brainwash your brain in a way when the opposite is true correctly? Because this is the only possible reason I can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax. Then, in the same paragraph, he compares himself to Mike Lee, Ken Loach and George Romero. Haha, stop him. You are now just silly. <br /> <br /> Do you enjoy this movie? Are you upset by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of the worship mentioned. Do you pocket your wages? Are they allowed to see other family members? Are you forced to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since Hitchcock? Tell ... it looks like a special brewing in a panorama. Say hello to the Los Angeles Times critic when you return to your colony, right? 0/10
