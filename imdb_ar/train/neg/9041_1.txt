Kinda loved the film despite its hectic speed. However, I did not appreciate the comment that was referred to as "Montana North". It is definitely not Montana North and will never be. Americans wonder why they are considered arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason. The children of the United States have stopped teaching that they believe they own the planet. Such a view of the middle world does not turn into one of the greatest nations in the world. Even in joking. I will never refer to the United States of America as Alberta South. Walt will never put us, so why start now? Other than that the film was very idiotic, luckier the next time.
