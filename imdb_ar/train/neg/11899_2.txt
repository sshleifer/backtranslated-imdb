Robert Forster, who is usually a very strong actor, is lost at sea here as a New York family man seeking revenge for the thugs who killed his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. A scary theme is exploited for the cheap thrill of the "desire for death" vein. It is not difficult to make fun of these disturbing procedures: the dialogue is full of howls, the statistics of the crime are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously written (especially a despicable judge allowing the accused murderer to withdraw from the courtroom). Low-rent production is a disgrace in itself, especially as violence in our cities has only increased. * from ****
