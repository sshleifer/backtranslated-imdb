Joe Don Becker. We were fantastic at Walking Tall and had a good role in the Goldeneye, but here in Final Justice all hope went ... I won the dark side. <br /> <br /> As with most of mankind, my main experience with this experience was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into the baker's flesh and fail to flick. Obviously they just started out with "Mitchell" on an anti-goo kick and here lies their continued theme. <br /> <br /> It makes a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favorite is "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's Meatloaf: Texas Ranger", "Not worth any sponge," "Why were you wearing a prom dress," and my favorite - "Son ..."? What? By itself, "final justice" is, as Jo Dun put it in the film, "a big fat dew." But here, in fact he has some entertainment value. You can get a chance and pick up this version of "Final Justice." <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice." Ten to issue MST3K only. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don in town.
