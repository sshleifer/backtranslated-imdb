It saddens me to make a film with many of my favorite actors, sites, and favorites, such as Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC, and politics, but Sentinel has already reached a low level. They seemed to have a great idea up front, signed up for the right cast and had some great shots in the city, and then took a holiday to let the remaining crew upgrade the rest. "I not only feel that she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still evaporated after more than a decade that she was the only one, and certainly the only bad actor in the film, to win an Oscar for LA Confidential .) But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, who loved Jack Bauer in "24" again, plays Jack. I miss his old days, "Time to kill" or "A few good men". Douglass certainly took a gap in the act and phoned this letter. Plot: Someone, a traitor of the Secret Service, wants the death of President Douglas (random) being framed. Does anyone believe it? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they reached this sub-plan halfway, it ended up before you knew it. And why did someone (s) want the president to die? Will this appear in the sequel? There are a very large number of holes confirmed, and many of the doors that have been opened and never closed and highly predictable. If you see only one film every year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone familiar with these types of movies or even watch one "law and order" episode you'll know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinema was good, and although Sutherland played Jack again, he still got it.
