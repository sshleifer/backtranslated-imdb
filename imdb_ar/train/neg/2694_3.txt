Warning: It contains spoilers. If the film starts with a sexy scene, it's a bad film. (See eg 300). This one confirms Lima above. The second scene represents the spinning center for each movement. The fact that we know the end makes the film boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. This made it more frustrating. To compensate for the shortfall caused by the thrill, we learn more and more about the extent of character imbalance. And yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, drug addict, more? , He is betraying his wife, more? , Plans to steal his father, more? , His wife cheats with his brother, more? Regrets to collude in the death of his mother, more, he is a serial killer, more? Etc., it's not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he can have a top job. Why did not his wife leave him before? On the other hand, I enjoy the performance of actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here PSH provides the rest of the $ 7 spent for this absurdity. Why Tinker? Because it makes no sense, why should I care about the bad characters? Another broken heart is that the film must have a sympathetic personality (at least fun). <br /> <br /> Many feelings, for example, are supposed to care about the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents' lives before the crime.
