AKA: Monday in the sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I've just seen. Three men walk aimlessly and drink, and they dwell in everything and everyone on their way. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a complete waste of the film, without the quality of a single replacement. <br /> <br /> I've read reviews describing the shows here as "fantastic," "beautiful," and "heroic." I fear that I do not agree, unless these men are supposed to come as the first ignorant stupid people who ever walked. <br /> <br /> All in all? This was not a movie. Wander around everywhere and lose everyone except the audience. I've seen this three times, and I can not see how much anyone sees in this trash all my life. There is nothing deep here, at all. It's crap. <br /> <br /> The ZERO / 10 rating of the ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
