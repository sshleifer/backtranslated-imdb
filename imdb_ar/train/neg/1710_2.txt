Every once in a while, a group of friends, with a limited budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that will make the world of horror a storm. Remy & Co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and colleagues were successful with Bad Taste; Myrick and Sanchez minted the Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Todd Sheets and his poems are determined to stay forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is over. This miserable effort (about the zombie plague that eats meat) is a reminder that while many people these days have access to a video camera, this lesson is a lesson on how not to scare the cheap. So as a sign of their hands experience in the production of full-length film. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Sheets did not close his eyes to a well framed picture (some camera angles and movements are really pretty good), but instead a) has a lousy scenario b) has a lousy crew, and c) does not realize It has a poor script and casts. This means that the last film is amateurish to the extreme, and unlikely to be viewed entirely by anyone other than zombie movie fans (like me) or crew members and crew (like those who gave the film positive comments). <br /> <br /> Obviously, the aim of Zombie Bloodbath is to get rid of the stray dogs, and the nets (which currently have 34 unbelievable titles under his belt as an exit) are certainly coming out with buckets of waste and blood Delivered at every opportunity. But while these moments are undoubtedly prohibited, they are not particularly convincing, and soon become boring. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, this is a really bad film, with virtually no recoverable features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First, it has the largest mullet in the history of the film, as narrated by Jerry Angel, who plays Larry (as well as many zombies). The magnificence of Barnett (along with Sharp's bring) is the only reason to watch this film. <br /> <br /> Secondly, he has a pathetic stealth zombie: flesh-eating carcasses waiting for victims to wander before, before jumping out of hiding to launch a weak attack, which requires no effort to escape. He is known for standing behind the door for hours waiting for someone to open it, and the "pathetic ghost zombies" sometimes hide behind the low walls or sit in the churches representing the members of the group. <br /> <br /> Normally this movie will get this bad on 1/10 for me, but to celebrate Jerry Angel's flowing closing, I will raise my rating generously to 2/10.
