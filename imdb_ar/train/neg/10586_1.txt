This is a well-made media film in the context of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Front Line has already done this piece and managed to bring Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. More troubling is the fact that the film's director, Charles Ferguson, a former intellectual, was a supporter of the war until the occupation went south. What do I think will happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went so well that it was spoiled by these annoying Nazis. And this is what this film looks like - an apology for the occupation rather than the dismantling of the act of war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better managed - as if any war could be better.
