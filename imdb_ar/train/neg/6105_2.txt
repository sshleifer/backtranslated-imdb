If you're the kind who can come out of a very bad movie, I highly recommend this. If not, keep away. It's a stunningly looking movie, and sometimes you might wonder if it's just a joke by someone. The most positive comment I can make on this subject is that the responsible people seem to realize that it was just a little budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of pleasure here. <br /> <br /> But this is as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​the giant killer mushroom is simply young people covered with colorful beige sheets with what seems to be the garbage can be covered on their heads. Obviously it is not meant to be taken seriously (at the very least), but even with this disclaimer you will find yourself shaking your head in a gorgeous cheesy. Or laughing out loud often, as I did.
