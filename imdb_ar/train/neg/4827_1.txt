If this film aims to discourage people from taking drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using it, I was waiting for something to happen and nothing happened at all. This film is not a horror or a drama. It's just the paranoia of meth users. This movie may win an award for using the word "F" several times and to no avail. It was not well explained, but I felt they were making meth to replace the meths owed to someone. Hector became worse and more paranoid when the film continued and the girl became more hopeless. The end really does not make sense. The film makes no sense unless it shows how annoying it is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth head. I have relied on other comments when I decided to watch this movie, and the rating on this film should be below average.
