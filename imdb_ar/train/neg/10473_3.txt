I went to see the Omega symbol with a group of other Christians totaling about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian filmmaking. What we got was a very painful, criminal and thrilling attempt at a movie. It has good looking output values ​​but also has a poor representation, weak text with poor dialogue, and has no real sense of direction. Since the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We have all been disappointed, and some people in our group have put this film as if it were more of an cheese than Anaconda. None of us thought that the film took less than two hours. Bright effects and clear-cut photography can not save this bad and bad film. I'll give it 3 out of 10, and the rating is very high because I hired "Werewolf (1996) the obnoxious movie the night before the movie appeared.
