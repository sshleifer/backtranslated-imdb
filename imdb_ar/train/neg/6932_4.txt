I waited a long time to see Dr. Thiers Dong Dong, and after I saw him, I was very disappointed about it. It's not the baroque movie I was expecting. The trailer (which I saw on DVD Something Weird) is much better than the entire film, which can be forgotten significantly. There are hardly any prominent scenes in it, and the appearance and appearance are interesting, but it does not even come close to the other baroque films designed there, from Fellini or Godorowski. The characters are dim and there is almost nothing dramatic, although we see rape, steel, insanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was that it was a discussion, more than anything else. It was like watching a book. I just wanted to have the movie moments of silence or mood or something, and instead we see / listen to the main characters in the endless chat about tedious things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
