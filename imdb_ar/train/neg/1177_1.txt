This movie is a complete crap! Avoid wasting cellulite at all costs. I am proud of the depths of the 1970s cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like the shock, but I need a coherent story. However, if you watch your fellow horse, this makes you out of this movie. The most sad part is that lame wolf wolves with functional wang. I mean it's just hard to sit, not to mention that acting is terrible and the soundtrack is very bad. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (what looks like gorilla hands that reach naked ass for women) but do not waste your time or money because you will not return.
