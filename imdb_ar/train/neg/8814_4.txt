This film is not interesting, except for the first ten minutes. Speed ​​and editing are a perfect introduction to a piece of music, better than Gosford Park. Then inexplicably slow down, it loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film only to regain focus in the end with the love affair between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cecil (Deneuve). In the middle, there are a lot of side lines and loose ends in the story, and many topics are not finished. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cecil. He was loyal to her after his relationship with her many years ago, despite her marriage from home and her establishment in Morocco. As Bunia, he is now rebuilding his own life and restoring it by taking Cecil's marriage mask. After doing this, he was buried after a strange accident (literally) and becomes a coma. Do not wake up until after they burned the old image as a sign that they are reconciled with the past and can start her life together again properly. ******* end spoilers <br /> <br /> It is still not clear what the vision that he wants to see us this way out because there are many other stories here: wants illegal immigrants to enter Europe, and there are frequent radio broadcasts about The overthrow of the former Iraqi regime. Baby Cecil Bisexual and dogs bite him (loyalty) Once an interview his friend, while the girl who lives with her look sick (it?). Her sister is a traditional Muslim and has a relationship with the Cecil couple. It portrays Morocco as a backward unnecessary, in spite of all the buildings, there is a strange vision of a colonial embodied in the past almost. It depicts Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may be true at times, but certainly not in general. In the end, everything can be described as adding some locale and Portuguese language. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are awesome. Through this article, become familiar too, so they're able to rotate something extra in every scene: brow lift, body language, and pride radioactive, and behavior embarrassing. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in the world at present. With some notable exceptions of course.
