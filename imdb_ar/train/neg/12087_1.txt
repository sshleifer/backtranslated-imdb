I have seen all kinds of Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was more ambitious, Mel Gibson was fast, and Lawrence Olivier was the best - forever. But now we come to Maximilian Schell on Bard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a dubbed version of a German television production of the revered William Shakespeare. But if there is a slower, busier, more uterine version and the worst stages there, it must have been done at the school level. <br /> <br /> After watching him on the MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots taking a good jab at the old boy, the depth of black and white TV, Shakespeare and wisdom (?) of the Germans acting in English and making it seem like Ingmar Bergman refused. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST Rivas. Best fonts? "I will unleash the Great Dinosaurs," "I do not think so," "Breathe," "Meet the Beatles," "Dad, will you help me with my science project?" And my personal favorite. "But then there is Schill, and Shakespeare's great character is very much like the store's model, but not just expressive, no doubt he's a great actor, but he starts here like Paul Newman in" The Silver Cup " You should have seen these two things on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is an example that it is best for you to read only the book, at least the book is not named by Ricardo Montalban . < br> <br /> <br /> Just one star for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, naturally, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> A happy prince, not resolved.
