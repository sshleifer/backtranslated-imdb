... I saw that in my teens. This movie was mildly amusing. What I liked about Soul Survivors was the gothic atmosphere during party scenes, the constant twists between "the dream" and "reality." <br /> <br /> If there were no movies like "The Sense" and "Don" see now, I'd be surprised from the end.
