As I said, the book was good and this may be a good film if Melissa Gilbert was not terrible and does not believe in the vanguard. What kind of dialect was it supposed to be anyway? It looked like her awful Russian accent in another film I saw in it. It took 3 attempts before I could watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was as good as the other lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked the sights of the beach location. They added some much-needed brightness to get rid of Melissa Gilbert's depressing picture. I think they probably used San Francisco's views for their benefit though. It seems that the night scenes were actually SF, but I may be wrong. I do not remember that the character in this book was frustrating. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert away from any futuristic films that require tone!
