Despite its own stereotypes, virtually "nameless" appearance and a clearly low budget, I thought this movie was okay; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could infect people also sounded a bit ridiculous to me. But in the end, I thought the film treated the concept well (even if some scenes were a little cliche). <br /> <br /> The film was very good, and both seem to be taking their roles seriously. However, I could not think that Janine Turner was somewhat like Gina Davis. Maybe it was just her face or the make-up, the hair and the clothes she was carrying in this film, but it kept mingling in my back all the time. <br /> <br /> While it's not a "must see" or a great movie by any standard, "Fatal Error" is a fun click that will make you see until the end.
