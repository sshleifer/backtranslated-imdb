How did this piece of crap stay on TV for a long time? It's terrible. Makes me want to shoot someone. It's so fake that it's actually worse than the science fiction film of the 1940s. Better a stroke than watching this nonsense. I remember seeing him when he first came out. I thought it could be interesting, and then I discovered just how stupid and mad and ridiculous it was. It was so bad that I really took out my pocket knife and hung my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> I ask people to stop watching this program and all other reality programs, they are garbage that disturbs the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.
