This is a bad film by all standards. The story in Match Point was a certain plot, direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen blended his culture with the classical English killing culture and explored what to do). <br /> <br /> Scoop, but has no this. It is poorly written, and the two boys are hopelessly crap, and the story itself has no interest at all. The type of spoof requires at least some kind of subplot with brilliant explanations and links (why are tarot cards and keys under French horns kept in closed rooms?). <br /> <br /> Allen's delightful and ingenious versions of different types of Hollywood (Curse Scorpio Jade / Purple Rose Cairo and others) have provided us with a lot of fun over the years. Even the Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately his inspiration left him this time.
