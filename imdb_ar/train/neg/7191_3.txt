I saw him last night at midnight at the Monde Film Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie was clearly rated by IMDb fans. It was only acting but regular. The directive did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot is largely lacking: the film revolves around these university graduates and the game they play makes joke calls (7eventy 5ive). In addition, you can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes. If you want to make prank calls with an ax that lets you jump only once or twice throughout the entire movie, you might want to. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
