There was not one recovery factor in this film. Friendly and I love motion movies. Especially the fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were fantastic), but this movie was not amused. Five minutes of movement followed twenty minutes of speech and "angry" facial expressions. The main protagonist is a turbulent personality who has experienced a battle and is therefore forced to grasp seriously at all times. The army has disrupted its bowel movements as well as mastering the fighting style. Music is not too good. They fight for rap and hip-hop in the streets, because these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise of the low-budget play. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B style. The actors offer their lines as if they were reading from the cue cards and the lines themselves must be burned and left burning in a rotten Hollywood alley called the movie "Honor", but there was no honor in producing this film. It was just a waste of money, spending wisely is something I consider honorable. <br /> <br /> Go to see Philon instead. Fighting scenes and attitudes are more realistic.
