After less than 10 minutes of this film, I wanted to end up because it was painful. The whole horror film was about a group of little bats doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let the positive reviews fool you because this is a really terrible film and you should not see it. <br /> <br /> The film plot has the potential to be great, but it does not happen. A group of five teenage girls lead the house one night when they find themselves chased by a crazy driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes in the film, the characters are already arguing and this does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a group of whining girls, crying and screaming, "acting" and arguments. Neither dialogue is remotely interesting, so you can not recognize or enjoy these characters. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and shocked when I discovered that these characters were meant to be a teenager. None of these women appeared in less than 20 years, and one of them seemed to be 30 years old. At least get people who look old. None of them made decent performances remotely, and seemed to be picked up from the street or were friends of the director without acting abilities. The "actress" who played the role of the killer overcame her, but at least showed something the other girls did - a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things because these girls are a handful of pure dumb bats. That's all I can really say about them, and it did not help them stay. If I had to go into the details, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and their car routes too much. One girl injures herself and grumbles around her ... Four of them do not wear seatbelts ... What do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally assaulted by the killer ... and you happen to be "very painful" to help you? whatever. <br /> <br /> The film is very bad. I do not care if this film has a peanut-sized budget, and the photography was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The photographer was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed on the window somewhere, and the number of times the camera was flooded and shaken by a shocking "actress". She was also gracious, and sometimes she could not hear what the characters were saying (not that he deserved anything to listen to). <br /> <br /> The car is supposed to be deadly in the film (supposedly beaten, even though we just heard the incident) is actually a real-life directors' car. No wonder they did not show the car hit! This movie is very cheap, so they can not even view a slightly scratched car. Oh, I must mention the soundtrack too ... if that is what it was. It was terrible ... sad one second, then the hard rock the next day. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes looks like a horrible home movie shot half way through the night with a group of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. It will not be useful when the scenario is terrible, and the absence of fear / tension / suspense and (hardly any Gore to compensate), the representation is terrible and the quality and image of the image is terrible. This terrible movie was low budget. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
