Horrible movie with parts of Remmons scattered about. Your worst comedy of the 80s / 80s of the last century is that of the wonderful kids who control the school with a strange plan. This terrible film consists of the plot of a girl enjoying Ramon's popularity and a school determined to fight against her repressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero from Guitar Wolf if you want a B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with seal approval of the Ramones who probably need some money so they said yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think of because this film is blowing.
