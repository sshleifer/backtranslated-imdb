Yes I saw crude cuts. Unsexed sex scenes. Cut the ominous scenes. Almost equal to the film "need" for the awful representation. This movie is bad as you get bad movies on bad screenplay, bad representation, bad effects, bad sites, bad works and bad everything. The best "actors" in the film were the lap dancers they rented for vampire addicts! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the "smiling actor" as someone else has said, makes the appearance of matchmaking talented here. Its amazing ability to drive badly when it is clearly shaken by people wearing the bonnet (check for windshield reflection), and its inability to turn left, is a category. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. In addition to its remarkable use of the game gun can not be disturbed by props men even disguised as real weapons. Hardly any other actors on the screen can present their lines. It was as if half of the time they were waiting for was a nonexistent error! <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were so good that the men who did so took off their real names from credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are lots of good comics that are funny and do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
