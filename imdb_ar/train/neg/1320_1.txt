This film was exactly what I was expecting when I first read this film. Maybe you've written a more exciting plot, it's unfortunate that they left it to a group of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was definitely a good player, but he has to thank God (and we too) for not having to rely on his effective skills to gain his strength. He can not play, can not talk, and can not even move well on the mainland without his skis ... Michelle Honzaker is a pretty blonde girl, that's it. It is clear that she was not selected for her stunning efficiency in dramatic roles but probably for her beautiful legs. However, I must admit that she can be a Tomba proxy teacher, because it's the worst representative of them, and that's funny, especially considering it's not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it made me laugh really, loud, and very loud.
