Clive Robertson as a chartered husband married to a rich wife, offers a performance worthy of playing here if there is before; it seems as if director Michael Anderson continued to scream "ask; think of a coma, less energetic" through his small blisters during Robertson's training. The rest of the cast is barely better. It is hard to see Jennifer Agutre of the reputation of Logan RUN in what should have been embodied as a pivotal role. If the representation quality is better three times; if some holes are filled plot more gap. If a shot of adrenaline is given, this yawn may be raised to a level acceptable to the audience of the TV channel at Hallmark. As it is, their classification is inexplicably high, and one can help to think that chronic insomnia uses DOMINIQUE to capture snoozing time. Late-night phone marketing staff may lose a great opportunity not to buy it that way.
