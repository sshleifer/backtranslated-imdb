Although I saw "Gymkata" in a theatrical way in 85, I did not remember anything from this plot except for the mysterious images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against the backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the end. <br /> <br /> After reading some other reviews, I took a copy of the newly released DVD to enter the Gymkata world again. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is one of the films that was produced during the 1980s that will go straight to the video today. The hero of the movie stars, gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, was recruited from blue to infiltrate the nation of "Permistan" to enter and win the "game", a blood-sucking game sponsored by Khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like "Yak power". The objective of the mission involves a Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained on martial arts by Princess Robali, who does not speak or leave the house. Once the coaches try to integrate with the locals by wearing a bright red jacket with blue and white dashes. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Pakistan, on his way to a date with fate and the game. <br /> <br /> A star, Kurt Thomas served by director Robert Claus, who looks like he was not on the group. The script named is just an incompetent side. See many other reviews howling all the time. The crazy town has some good moments, but in the end it is destroyed by bad editing. The end ... there is still a good adventure germ here. Hong Kong's visceral movement and faster speed may be good.
