Although it is not quite as bad as its adaptations of a game to a movie, only a large piece of this kind of slag does not get much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a satisfactory inability to accept that he is not making good films. One day, it will run out of money and stop bombarding. <br /> <br /> The acting seemed like no other, the dialogue seemed like they were reading TelePrompTers and Small Boll's "touches." Seen in everything. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll films, this movie should not exist. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll itself should not be present. > _>
