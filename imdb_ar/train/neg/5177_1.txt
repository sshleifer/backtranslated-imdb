This is very bad, very bad too. Representation is the biggest joke in history. I did not bother to see her, I did it after 20 minutes, and it was as disappointing in the end as at the beginning ... I do not really understand the taste of people, I am a horror fan and I am not bold but I have a limit! Maybe a quarter of the star is better than the beginning of The Hoast but that's all. So I recommend that you do not waste 15 minutes you will be able to watch them. I mean representation is better done by monkeys. The older brother with the parents role is just awful. Do not pay characters in C movies? No, I have to say it's not the first time I think the horror film is bad, but it's absolutely one of my first ten films, and it will be a great place with a picture of a vampire, a cabin on the lake, The Hoast!
