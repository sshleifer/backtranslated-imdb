I think this may be one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get "the same characters" with different people is a very bad idea. If they could not get Sarah Michelle J and Ryan B. In this, they only have to reduce their losses and they have to review it. Instead, they get appalled new representatives in what they did. I seriously felt that I was in a high school or in a college (bad) playing a crane representing those people. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was this their first film? He certainly looked like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is also similar to the original in a few lines of speech. I had just finished watching the first one and figured out No. 2. I was very excited to watch the second show and ended up being the worst show I've ever seen. I never do * Never * Turn off a movie, but this movie ends after about 30 - 40 minutes.
