The body of a young girl stripped of all possible means of identification was found. When he discovers that one leg is taller than the other, it is assumed to be the body of the daughter of the missing couple. After this shock, the couple is separated and the mother becomes addicted to sedatives and leads to a miserable existence. All this changes when she receives a phone call from her daughter day after several years! With the help of a former cop and reporter, began a journey to determine whether her daughter was already alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess conspiracy, moving at a slow, painful pace, and completely unscientific. The saving grace is Emma Villarasao, who does a wonderful job as a desperate mother. The best part of the film is the end, but I'm not sure it's worth the rest of the movie. Beware of the English translation in the latest R1 version - they are not very accurate.
