As far as Rodney Dangerfield liked, this was a terrible film. The plot was a sort of universal rip-off of different films, but unfortunately they forgot to get rid of good jokes. In addition, it was annoying and boring and that was ok. If you are looking for a good laugh, I rent a copy of the special parts.
