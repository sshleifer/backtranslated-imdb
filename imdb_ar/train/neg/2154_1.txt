Let me confess. I found this video in use and bought it because Guttenberg looked very sexy in his underwear on the cover. But inside was another story. In addition to the fact that the film was essentially a spoof for special effects of the "invisible" genre (very clear chains and other instruments), the script did not miss any chance - in fact it went out of its way - in insulting all races - WASP and the real gay Or imagined. Every insult directed at someone in the scenario was either homophobia or racism or both. It starts to stir your nerves, along with the fragile sound and photography in a candid camera style and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat surprising. But by the time you get there, you do not care much. Too bad, it may be a reasonably good film.
