My comment on the Russian version of the space space race Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) on the first Russian channel on 10-13 April 2006. The bad translation could have destroyed some details but I doubt so. The number of factual errors is impossible to include, especially in the first episode (development of the first missiles). Even the American half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. No V-2 / A-4 launches from the United States are notified to the public. Three different Jupiter C missiles are launched with the same UE serial number on board. Apollo 1 will be launched to the moon, etc. In the Russian half, everyone is ridiculous. Koroliev is afraid of NKVD, and Glushko is a spoiler and traitor, Mishin is addicted to alcohol and so on. There is no motive and no life at all. Uniforms and decor are awful. Gagarin is singing a trivial song waiting for release (I think this version was added specifically for the Russian version).
