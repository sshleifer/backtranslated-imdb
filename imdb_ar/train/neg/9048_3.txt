It was originally broadcast as the ABC movie of the week. This includes two young university students who have been stranded in a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed to make phone calls and nobody knows they are there. The following are rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very worrying result. <br /> <br /> The TV version was bleak (on time). Nudity and beating were not exhausting, but the general feeling of boredom put it down. The unclassified version is worse - there is abundant nudity, and the violence is severe, and in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying prisoner being forced to strip off her clothes while being used by a guard like me. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with exploitation films but this film runs on the edge of the abyss. You feel that movie producers enjoy these poor women being tortured and insulted - all in your face as if you should enjoy it. The pessimistic end does not help unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Give it a 3 because the acting is good - but this makes watching the movie more difficult. A sickly movie. Not recommended.
