** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can get a very unpleasant subject, this movie does not offer help piles of extremely violent melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and cut several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand any director of films inspired by this trash drama. No one of Hemingway's women can work here (although Mariel Haas has improved over the years), Ann Bancroft is the only touch of the class as a trial lawyer, and Chris Sarandon is pathetic and unintentionally fun like the bad-smelling guy this piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk purse from the ear of this script, stuffed with an explosion with a very bad conversation and strange situations. For example, the final sequence, where Margaux stuck her gun and chasing Sarandon down after his latest horrific work, was exciting but it gave rather laughable laughs. Add a famous and wonderful musical score by Michelle Poulnarev and you will have a real fun guilty, although you are likely to feel upset and need a hot shower after watching it. Do not say that you are not warned.
