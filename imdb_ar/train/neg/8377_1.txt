This is precisely why many people are still homeless. . . Because stupid producers pay their money to make such awful movies instead of donating if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than white chicks! The little man has a lame excuse to impose a personal dwarf as a child. The story is appalling given that it was written by six people. The idea is still not too bad, if it is original and not a copy of an animated episode. It's funny moments but some of them have ended up and some are just stupid. The acting was so bad. So was the directive. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of himself. It's very racist and abusive to the dwarf. I mean, instead of showing empathy with them, the filmmakers make fun of them! It's really disgusting to me how they do it. They see dwarves being like children. For a dwarf character, pretend to be an abandoned child just to get diamonds from a certain family. This is a lame excuse to show something like that. It was just not worth it. You do not see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
