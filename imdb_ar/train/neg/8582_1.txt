This film was filmed as a sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this film is fake. <br /> <br /> As a person born in Sheffield, I still have connections to the city, I was very disappointed by this film. One of them said it could have been prepared in Oklahoma, which sums up for me. It looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the American market. Many Americans - and many in the south of England - may not realize that Sheffield is a large city with a population of about half a million and has a sophisticated urban culture. In "The Amalekites," it was filmed as a quasi-rural, semi-rural town where everyone in Sheffield seemed to be drinking in the same old pub, where the idea of ​​a party dancing in a line in the village hall seemed similar. It was a small, interconnected society, not an urban city. <br /> <br /> The working class in Sheffield was completely different from their real-life counterparts, and they often turned to each other and communicated to each other in brief murmurs of dry words. They do not chatter, and they certainly do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even the rural areas, which are supposed to be in the Bek area, seemed strange to me. I got to know some places where I used to go hiking, but some aerial shots of the sea towers over a dark landscape reminded me more than Wales. In fact, in the credits in the end, the signal was spotted to Guinid, Wales. In the Peak District, in the summer, hiking and car parks are rife. Located between two large cities. It's not a wild thing. <br /> <br /> As for the idea that a young woman could fall in love, and lust after, the House of Postleithweet, it was ridiculous, and it could have been just a male dream. Her reasons for becoming a lover were never clear. None of the men appeared as partners or families; they were in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a movie about unemployed Shevilders would have lost. Sheffield was only present in the minds of her writers and middle-class filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a huge fake! <br /> <br />
