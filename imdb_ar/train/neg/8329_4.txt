I doubt its importance for Queer Cinema, as it appears to be about homosexuality through violent behavior rather than making any clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> The three stories are intertwined in a rather dirty way. I found myself trying to unravel the anarchist narrative in the first 15 minutes, and this alone did not sit well with me. The weak plot points were repeated infinitely as if we had not gotten them in the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of dialogue filled throughout the film. It's like 45 minutes of Boy's Short Short instead of a full-length movie. He had some erotic taste, male nudity and sexual attraction, but the total did not equal with his parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: Boxer / Stocker's story was the strongest yet it felt as though it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years, and now only is he facing him? I felt as if the mouse cat game was not developed enough to merit it. We needed more information about them and fewer parking / locker scenes with Tim saying relentlessly "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Part II: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to hit him while he kneels. Tony does not seem to think, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the implications of his humorous hobby - not even after doing so naked. This tale lacks the most important transition from "I'm a straight guy slapping my man friend for fun" to "I think I might be gay and beat him because I want to spread his ass and do his S / M pencil sharpener." It is very important to leave them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, all these stories have moved their points in half the time. The third part with men and women slapping each other adds to this thought. Moreover, it was not necessary and did not add anything to the film. Yes, the actors did well under these circumstances and the four male strings were very exciting. But the make-up (bruises and cuts) was on par with the show of grammar school talent. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat for this story to have any impact on a gay politician. The film does not make any statement or waste of time and does not attract or deserve enough for a thoughtful investment. Deadly drawback is an amateur approach, which makes it impossible to eventually take it seriously.
