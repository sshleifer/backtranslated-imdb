God This film was very boring, regardless of the music I really liked, I mean what was the purpose of making this film actually, please read this review not watch this film, it is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act but is really pathetic in this film, I am really ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this film, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another beautiful face with no talent ever, she can not act at all, and there was no sense to her being in this film, as for the other girl Radha was on what OK, but I think it could have been done better. <br /> What a waste of time. Please buy great music and do not watch this movie.
