The premise of the film has been explained, and if you have reached that limit, you do not pretend to pretend that I am a film critic. With this my opinion is said in the film is very low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but this is in his non-great business category besides DOA 2 and 3, and others (many). <br /> <br /> It seems that the film has become a free pass because it is a Takashi movie and nothing can be Takashi wrong. This is a high school approach to cinema. For the rest of us, we'll find an hour and a half and a screaming baby without a real reason is quite annoying (and yes, that keeps away from the film), the movie's pace almost reaches the stalemate levels, acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If someone is a fan of Takashi, you'll see it regardless of the height of your interests. It lacks any originality (see the story of Neverending) or any evolution in personality from the leading personality in the face of conflict, and then superficial. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the first film was commissioned by Miike to write a post, but that does not mean that the stretch of what we hope Miike's character may not be spread on the screen. All we got is some Miike avatar's avatar towards the director of photography. <br /> <br /> The film could have been great. The hypothesis is not difficult to understand. But this seems to have been run on the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is whether you will enter Miike directly with some standards such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then a film in his works such as Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog and Bird People of China.
