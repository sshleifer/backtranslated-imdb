All participants (and the public) must search for "Candidate" to see how good this film is. What happened to the story of South America? What Julie Christie and Kate Cabshaw were thinking of to allow their roles to be cardboard scraps. So far I have been impressed with every performance and / or Gene Hackman movie. He was either uninterested (I can not believe it) or a terrible mistake. I also loved and defended Richard Gear (and tarnished him). But here he did not have "strength." He was never intimidated and was sometimes convincing. All in all I was very disappointed. I was expecting much more from this director and cast. If you can not find "The Candidate", see "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
