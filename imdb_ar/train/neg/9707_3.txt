That was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on a DVD and under the film I found myself angry and the movie turned off for a moment. <br /> <br /> Heres what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 They were shooting at the father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying. <br /> <br /> 3 I looked Dinosaurs (mostly) to fakes <br /> <br /> 4 <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the image on the DVD was very poor <br /> <br /> What I liked: <br /> <br> Music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really wonderful. I have a soundtrack from this film. Sadly the sound quality is not good, but good in time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see dinosaurs inspire a kind of awe. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby kinda cute when he's in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 This funny scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 It is hoped that children who have seen this film will learn that evil always loses.
