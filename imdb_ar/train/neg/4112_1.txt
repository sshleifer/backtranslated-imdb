I think if they make any money they make a full-blown bomb like this. I need to enter the film industry. I wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better one-time scenario. Watch as the man runs through the tunnel, they use the same 30-foot tunnel above, over and over again and never changed the position of a stupid suspension light. <br /> <br /> I think if you get the thrill of meeting the GEM director in MOVIE, I think I'll choose a fight with him and start by beating Luffy. <br /> <br /> I think I need to vomit now
