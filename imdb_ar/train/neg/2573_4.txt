If you have plenty of time to waste it ... that's fine. Moving at a good pace but to pull this movie, it should be a little longer with a little more background on the incubator. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine. Mariana Clavino as the incubator does a better job and is the happiest. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gayle Ogrady, the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is ridiculous. Like most of these incubator films ... there are interesting parts ... but they generally leave you wondering why you spent time.
