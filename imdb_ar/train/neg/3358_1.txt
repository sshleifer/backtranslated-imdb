Inhabited by spirits. New edition, of course. The original film was a moving psychological thrill, and improved over time. Compared to a new edition in 1999, it's a classic game. There is no evolution in character, and there are only caricatures (the slut, the trusted brain, the colleague "we will be here here", the perfect worm). But, given how bankers relied on special effects as "the star," I think the characters you can sympathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. The carob weave, the slanting doors, the slack kids who can not speak frankly ... and the naive end of the infinity make it better for you to give you a new enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my bowling orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked it since "Cowboys". Stop it.
