Five passengers in a bus depot tell each other their fearsome dreams as they wait to receive them. But are there more nightmares than what the eye sees? <br /> <br /> Lucky, five bad movies for one price! Each part is characterized by the worst in acting, special effects, make-up and music. Was it supposed to be scary? Well .. I think I felt very scared during a episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you will sit there just as I was bored and tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Do not care. He never does. In fact, I've even stopped forwarding business ads quickly, because they have been more entertaining than the main feature. The end is the final cop-out. Yes, none of this actually happened. If you can say the same thing the day you set my video recorder to record this silencer .. 2/10
