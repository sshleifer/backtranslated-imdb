I watched this movie a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and loved it back then. I remembered it the other day and decided to see it again. The second time was not pleasant. Representation "So, So", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure it was not an extension of those actresses to play those characters. The plot ... There is no way in hell these women had gotten rid of the first robbery less than a second. (Side note: Why did not TT realize that even if she came up with money for the date of her trial, they would ask where she got it and would not have any logical answer!). Black women portrayed the horrifying stereotypes that the only way black women can "get over the system" or get a lot of money is to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. They play a big role on compassion / death, they all die in the end (a serious bar) but they are not sad (you think "They were stupid; they deserve death.) You only really care about characters unless you are a shallow person. /> I can not believe that the film rate is more than 5.
