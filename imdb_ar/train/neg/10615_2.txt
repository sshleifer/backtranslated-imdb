Strangely enough, less than two hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting in this uninspired flat command. If the story is as personal as it was supposed to be for Sally Potter, do not you expect to show some passion for her performance? Her representation was completely separate and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which were supposed to be fiery due to the nature of the dance, were embarrassing and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story in the film could be hard, and as such Sally Potter was wise in allowing a better actor to do the job rather than let her passion fall victim to her country.
