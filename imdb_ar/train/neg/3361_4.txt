It was one of the greatest films ever made, and he had everything to make a great movie. Incredible acting, awesome special effects ... ... Oh wait I have to think of a good film. Well, this was not one of them, I sucked easily. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is, what kind of a skeletal head might think this movie was at the age of 10. When I voted there were 206 people, and God knew what was going on in their heads. Now as with any other vote, it was 8 or 9 too high, but 10? Come on, what made this movie good to give it 10? I know that these are the same people who thought Jean-Claude Van Damme was the great dramatist.
