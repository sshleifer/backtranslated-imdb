I saw this on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to watch it or spend money on rent. The movie can be completely predicted - from the owner and the corrupt scheme, and even light electric cables. The plot is too weak and unbelievable - the man in the avalanche has been hit by a 20-foot wave of massive avalanche (using real shots) and all he has to do is get up and get rid of himself. The avalanche falls one million miles per hour and stops dying by the roadside. <br /> <br /> Some of the actual glaciers are impressive and show their destructive power. But the decade between the real collapse and the things that have been organized makes this film seem clearer. <br /> <br /> Give yourself an interest, do not bother with this one and not even on T.V.
