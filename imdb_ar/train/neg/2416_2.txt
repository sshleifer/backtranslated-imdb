2 stars, I am being generous. (Minor spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie set in Auckland Auckland. As the plot says, one scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a passing car. <br /> <br /> The main problem in this film is: What is zombie? All you do is "zombie" is a roar (which does not seem scary remotely) and a fake red blood fell from their mouths! No scary eyes, no decomposed body, just a bunch of pathetic people running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so not like the full "cover" that plagued the zombie or anything, it's just a few, it's in no time. <br /> <br /> Acting is actually too bad it's hilarious. No one can ever act in this film (except maybe a gang member) and it really seems that a group of friends gathered and decided to make their families and made a movie at the end of the week. <br /> <br /> Last note: Since when do doctors wear sportswear? Skip this one, please!
