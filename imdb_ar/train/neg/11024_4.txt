I first saw this film in the Soviet Union and many interesting scenes were released by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I saw it fully. So what? The plot is not incredibly wise - 2 men survive the genetic disaster and find themselves on the planet filled with strong, straight and basically strong ladies. The men are now trying to fight him and then follow a whole series of very silly cliches - sexual drive, persistent sexual desire for sex, feminists who appear to be complete idiots (you may agree with them, but they are certainly not), etc. and so on. Jerzy Stuhr's performance here is very bad and strange - he pulls out unfamiliar faces and repeats phrases such as "I'm in the elevator with a naked chick and I did not do anything to her!" This was intended to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a powerful farce full of predictable jokes and hints at the bottom of the waist. Do not waste your time in it - this is just bad.
