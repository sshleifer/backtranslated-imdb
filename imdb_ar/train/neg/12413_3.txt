I will not say that this film is terrible, because I saw what is worse, but it is not fit halfway. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really find out what was going on and where things were going. When the film ended, I left my head scratched. I watched until the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that might erase things, but once the credits expired, that was the order. I felt like I was dissatisfied with one weak point of conspiracy during the entire film, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Personal development is very shallow. I could not tell when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not tell if half of the characters were supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally handicapped, or had a bad actor to photograph them. It seems that this film is based on stereotypes (thanks to the fact that it is difficult to avoid using it when making a film about a rock singer), which should make personal development easier, because many other films have already illustrated the suffering of a child Abused, or heroin-addicted trials trying to become clean. It is easy to shoot stereotypes, which explains why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypes. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotypes left and right, but tries to make it as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seem to have been rejected without any explanation. I think this is good because there has been a short time spent developing characters that I did not really have the opportunity to know about, so I never missed one. <br /> <br /> Last but not least the singing was sadistic. terrible. The music she supports is not a prize winner, but it is often drowned out by screams from vocal cords. I swear that there is one point in the film where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I thought seriously that I would have to turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> As a whole, this movie is confusing. The characters are undeveloped, the representation of Georgia is wooden and solid, a sadistic personality turns from bad to another, without a story or an explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can not think of any good reasons to see this film unless you are thirsty for the movie pain.
