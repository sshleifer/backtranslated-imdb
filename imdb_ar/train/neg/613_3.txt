Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a poor piece of crap. I was surprised that I got a high rating as I did. What's wrong with this film? Here's a better question: what's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is nonsense and cliche. Here's what's going on pretty much ... Some young children who do not have friends are picked up, then killed, and returned as an agriculture for revenge. "All" is packed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you do not see this movie, do not waste time watching it. Also, the second is not much better, so do not bother watching that too ... I rated this movie three because I loved the Scarecrow outfit, not because there was anything good about the film. I think you have the picture.
