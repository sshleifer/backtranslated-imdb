****** SPOILERS ******* <br /> <br /> The host of unusual radio contests Kyser and his modest band is an excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to pick up a check in this place, a haunted house punctuated by a parody. Lugosi is a mystic whose flaws are revealed as a fraudulent attempt to win a fortune heir. Karlov is a butler and Laurie is a professor who exposes fake means, but it turns out that both conspire with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kai Kesser and his 30-year-old "children" revealed the truth with as little humor as possible along the way. Only absolute horror is recommended.
