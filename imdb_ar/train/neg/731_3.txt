Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) witnessed the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (John Fidel). Twenty years later, Mike brings together a group of friends in his family's cabin in the woods for the Halloween party. While playing a game where the guests recognize and face their worst fears ... Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father. He soon discovered that Murthy's spirit was a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and starts the blood bath. <br /> <br /> Most F / X movies are not very convincing, and the film takes up a cheap teen theme. A trivial old story. Members of the cast are: Kelly Benson, Philip Reese, Emmanuel Fugier, Byron Chip Moon and veteran actress Petsy Palmer.
