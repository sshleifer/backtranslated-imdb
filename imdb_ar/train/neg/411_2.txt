I do not usually feel a great incentive to comment on movies that I do not like, but in such a case, I have to say something. This film is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are many flaws in storytelling that I do not even feel compelled to explain because it is time for me to move forward with this experience. But the most disturbing point is that at no time in the film does anyone explain whether the motives behind Bacon's personality madness are due to the journey of force or a physiological reaction to his condition. The effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did some good things (cutting the director for Robocop on DVD is great). However, this film is stupid, and generally does not come close to explaining the point or artistic aspect of the subject, and instead settles down to take a predictable action without any fun. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other reviews say here (wish I had read it before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
