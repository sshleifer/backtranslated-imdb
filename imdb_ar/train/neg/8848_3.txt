Somewhere, deep inside this movie is buried a decent film half way trying to get out. The only effects are some early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a cemetery) and then a few pieces of production design. As I said, buried very deep. One of the biggest challenges facing supernatural films is how incredibly imaginative characters react in situations that are incredible. Annie McEnroe reacted to telling her that her sister (supposedly De Wallace from the first film) was (she was?) A wolf-wolf, if you recall, "Really?". Not one of the best responses to the challenge mentioned. The immortal stories continue as the story moves to Transylvania in search of the self-appointed "queen of wolves" (Stirba). As Steerba, Sybil Danning is the best two things in the film. Yes, even better than the collective sex scene of the Werewolf, Rep Reb Brown, and the odd-looking wolf events. Final credits have received a simple legend and are available with all their glory (at least until the censor finds it) on Youtube. Check it out to see why and remember, the whole movie makes the same amount of feeling. If it happened on American television, the credits were re-released to replace the endless recurring shot of Danning, who was tearing her head with another repeated, unbroken bullet, wearing only a cloak this time with a sort of top down. It is a kind of absurdity, a cherry moment that challenges ridicule.
