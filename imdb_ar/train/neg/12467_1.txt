This film was slower then Molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who placed the preview must receive an award for his administration to place each of the thirty seconds that were entered in the preview. I had to wake up the people I had seen several times. After it was over, I was upset because I woke them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is taken in the hope that something will happen, but nothing happens at all. It was easy to lose track of people's motives, and the personalities were flat and incomplete. By the end of the film, you only hope that everyone will die. Everyone runs either as respectable, trivial or pitiful, usually the three. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we saw a minute or two of added features, just for the kicking and laughter you understand, and all we saw was that people were arrogant about how socially aware they were. If they have spent the time in the movie they have installed on their back, it may be worth watching. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the anticipation of the excitement of "24". I got a lecture on social consciousness through the sand man's eyes.
