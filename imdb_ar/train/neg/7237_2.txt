Life is too short for films like this. I realized that it could not be good when I realized what I thought it was already - that David Schwimmer would play the exact same kind of person he plays in "Friends". <br /> <br /> Let's face it, either a man can play anything but a nerd or he has not offered him any other parts. I have a feeling that it is a combination of both. <br /> <br /> I must say that it is very hard to love a film that completely misses the great talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Tony Collett and Carol Kane !!!
