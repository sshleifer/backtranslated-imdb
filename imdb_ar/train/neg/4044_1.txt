From the point of view of the conspiracy and the movement, this film was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater hoping to finish and relax after 80 minutes from the end. Essentially, five characters appear in the film, A Son & Father, a friend of the girl, and two male characters at the age of the son who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. It seems that the film and scenes suggest homosexuality excitement, but nothing has actually happened to reveal this in one way or another. There were a few wonderful sights. At the beginning of the film, the girl's girlfriend shows the son out of a window outside their room and conducts a strange conversation. Photography gave an incredible seductive representation of the interaction between the two, ending with the recognition of her having another man who was "older". The end of that story.
