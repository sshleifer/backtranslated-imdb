This movie is in the type MANDINGO & DRUM <br /> <br /> Both were awesome but they are 100% better than this trip, <br /> <br /> Bad behavior and making Oliver Reid is the main name & legacy of Kate Ho Also in it. Tess is unfortunate. The rating is 1/2 * from the lowest level you can get <br /> <br /> As always <br /> <br /> jay harris
