I was lucky enough to meet George Ball (I still have a DS poster: TMOB signed) at a conference shortly after the release and asked him why he chose the movie "The Camp." Before he could answer, two girls from the studio objected to me and told me how "the studio was more familiar" and how "no one would take this film seriously." I had read Pantam's fingerprints for a few years thanks to a friend (who would remember the ComiCon audience in the 1970s Black Hawk and his band? I was in a few years with him), and I had higher hopes than we did. <br /> <br /> The Mujahideen insisted that no serious adventure would be taken seriously, and that the Camp was the only way. Many other fans jumped to my side, where Pal listened to the best he could. At the end of this little event, Pal came to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie on fire, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg proved Lucas that Doc Savage could easily have been the next major franchise for movies ... if not for flacks. <br /> <br /> Get rid of Doc's memory or history, and the film was worth the 6/10 rating as nothing more than a reckless hawk vendor. <br /> <br /> But the destruction of such legacy was no less than the abomination of killing a child in bed. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still appear on the screen, avoiding the inevitable comparisons of insiders to the Indiana Jones, but must be done with all seriousness and seriousness to restore the glory we should expect from America's first superhero champion . <br /> <br /> Side placements: Yes, there was a second scenario for the evil architecture, which is much more dangerous. Yes, there were footage clips synchronized, but most of the footage was set up with very few actors. And yes, there is one piece of Ron Eli jumping over a brick wall and exploding on something over his shoulder with a specially designed bronze gun. Eli wears an ashtray button over a white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... coming next summer!" Posters: If anyone knows who the studio shelves are that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego to attend the conference, idiots slapped on the side of the head and called them idiots. At that time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in lines and wide canvas pants, carrying Paramount bags.
