The only reason I saw the film until the end is the "hope" to see something interesting. The film is really bad and the girl's performance is very bad. Honestly, I'm not a film critic or an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this is a very bad job. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to mind as soon as I started talking was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and accepted her help in the film scenario in her film because she is a brilliant director." Surprise, surprise, the next day after I watched the movie I discovered on the Internet that Giada Kolagrand is his wife. Horrible story and horrible performance.
