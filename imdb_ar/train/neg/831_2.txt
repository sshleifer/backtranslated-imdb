Neighborhood! Yes, but not kicking. <br /> <br /> A true story: A while ago, a Dutch television station announced that it would publish a new presentation of reality. A quiz to some extent. The main participation in this show will be a woman who dies because of something terrible and will donate both to one lucky person with gradual renal failure. real. <br /> <br /> The country and international media spread throughout the story like flies on feces, saying it was horrible, immoral, what was coming to this world, and the like. . Somehow, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As months went by, tensions escalated to the extent that the government was mostly preoccupied with whether or not they should allow the offer to move forward, rather than running the country. <br /> <br /> The show showed live broadcast until the very last moment they were moving forward. Until the last moment, the country stood in arms, where the prime minister delivered speeches, every newspaper you wrote about, and everyone in the country heard his breath. The network was pushed on. Towards a new frontier in television. They have certainly succeeded in doing so. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast and we all saw a sick woman finally and she chose the right candidate to take her kidneys to live, while she died shortly after. <br /> <br /> Then, in the final moments of the show, it turned out to be a partial trick. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, that with advertising, advertising and all the discussions, created for months to a magnificent climax, served as a propaganda ploy to focus attention on the problem of a significant shortage of organ donors. The man who founded this network died because of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now this is a TV. Everyone left behind in astonishment. <br /> <br /> Do not give me a bad-tempered and misguided click on some of the women who are trying to get a Russian roulette show on American television. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if you think they will get it through the FCC. As if I think this will pass through the US Supreme Court based on freedom of expression. As if I thought the naive end was stopped by this woman and she had problems of conscience because some people fired on the air. <br /> <br /> This has been done before. Watch Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a near-good ending. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a very bad movie, along with a silly ending. It was shot in the end. Is this supposed to make us feel better moving to the audience after we leave the theater because there is some kind of justice? Do not take my words on this, but I would say this: leave this on your own and see the test pattern instead, you will get more quality.
