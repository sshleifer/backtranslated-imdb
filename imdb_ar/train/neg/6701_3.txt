I've been an environmental advocate for years and I was looking forward to this show. I put it to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new stuff. Maybe I can if I can get past Rachel. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of this is being shown as a realistic and attractive view to this audience. Does not work with someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Since Ed is representing this great line of information, perhaps the second really serious presentation on the environment would be a good idea. Things are not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I no longer record the episodes or watch the show, but let me know if there is a real green show in the works.
