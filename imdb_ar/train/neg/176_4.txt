<br /> <br /> I saw this on the science fiction channel. He came immediately after the first. For some reason I kept this film interested in me. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- Vandals --- Well ... It was amazing how this guy got involved in making the film. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this series, half of the killings / attempted murders were basically without reason. Stanley was killed because of creative differences. The co-writer was captured because of creative differences, but what is the deal with trying to kill actors? No cast, no film. He wanted to "look real when they died"? If this movie should be a high budget, use special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first girl, the captured girl escapes, and Stanley ends up in chaos and disappears. Woooooow (irony). This movie has potential. The most sad thing ... The really sad part ... I was watching the "3 lake side cabin". Just because I love Jude Nelson, the only good part of the series.
