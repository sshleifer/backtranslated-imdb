I must say I was really surprised by the high ratings of this film. I found it to be quite stupid. Does the mother get "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing I touched twice made her vision go on ... just looked very ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer was terrible. It was very annoying. The girl who played Laurie did a good job, and most of the supporting actors did what they had to do. <br /> <br /> I usually like the LMN and I am very open when it comes to movies but this movie seems to have a silly plot and at the top of the acting it was just not for me.
