You must listen. I have been warned, however, that I have paid money for it, after reading all the reviews, after knowing that the original is "very bad, it's good" and that part 2 does not fit into this category at all, however, so I can not resist . What exactly happened here? The first part was Farhana, and was made by a lot of political imbalance, and other crazy, recreational greens, this one, maybe there could be a worse sequel on the green ground for him, not the case basket 2, hell, not even the Troll 2. It's really worse What in history, something that really says something due to the leading features at the bottom of the original file. Part 2 Criminal Offender was just a completely different brand of bad. The video shot, zero degree, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of past memories, and above all, Ethel lost part of her girth. I mean, frankly, is this a kind of sick joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
