From the first moment, this "thing" is just an awful sequence of very short shortcuts to the blurry camera work. While the overall plot has all the potential for excitement, the story is so bad that I can not afford it. From the middle of the film, the actions of characters are not logical to me. Stop reading now to avoid spoilers. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea of ​​making Edna make coffee for them after they released her son's arm is far less than his alleged experience; it's just a very stupid idea. Dominino does not question the split requests she receives from Claremont Williams over a broken telephone call; should not she be suspicious for a long time that Williams is turning her over? FBI agents seem out of their mind as they appear with only one helicopter for something they have every reason to think about launching a capital mafia. Moreover, what they do by blocking information and leaking it towards Cigliutti is a great incitement to murder. It seems to me like a farewell to justice. If so, the FBI is investigating. In fact, they will have a messy situation that can not be fixed if they do so. We know of a car accident that is usually seriously injured at least if most passengers are not killed but miraculously leaves them with few bruises. On the contrary, the incident is immediately followed by Domino, who adores Choco, who from the point of view of Domino is by no means founded on previous events but only by anesthetizing them to the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The full sequence of scenes from a call from Claremont Williams seems to me exactly as he wants to be an exciting role. This in addition to the work of the terrible camera turbulent makes the piece reluctant to call the film. I am sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is not available.
