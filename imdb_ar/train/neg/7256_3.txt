I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised great pictures and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... a pool. The film is designed largely after Baraka, wide angles, very similar shots with dedicated cameras to capture long time traffic in each shot. So some of the scenes were identical (street with traffic). While the blessing recounted a fascinating story, intertwined nature, man-made environments, spirituality, and the horrors of the world in an interesting style and wonderful music, the film jumped from one shot to another without a comprehensive story, a medium musical score, and then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there must be some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half the film is Egypt and the landscape (similar to Arizona, but I did not bother checking it out). People seriously, this is terrible, and hire it if it must, but do not buy it. Directors must be ashamed of themselves to put this up.
