I will say one thing to Janet and Nelson - even when stranded in a musician not sung, stuntless, and painless like this, there is still a flash in their eyes. Yes, chemistry between the famous duo exists even when the material is thin. Even when the result is practical, one does not exist, depending on a few attractive tones. Even when the circumstances are unbelievable - yes, even for the imagination. <br /> <br /> The fact is that she has a chemistry with Nelson more than her real-life husband Jane Raymond in SMILIN 'THROUGH, which was, however, a much better film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Janet and Nelson as much as I like the following fans, but this is the bottom of the heap. Janet is more than embarrassing in his "hep" number with her one-sided Barnes Barnes - and Nelson can only get out the empty stare when confronted with the most ridiculous positions. <br /> <br /> One can not but wonder what this was like in Broadway in 1938. Certainly, it must have more style and style than is evident in this poor MGM production. Edward Everett Horton stumbles on an unusual role, and none of the players can support any form of life in this mess. It's like an amateur night in the studio even with a few professionals being distributed among the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Summary: A painful presentation of Rodgers and Hart's musical films. I could not recommend it, even to McDonald's and Eddie lovers. Even if the close-up of Janet still glows with its stunning beauty, this film is bad-jawed.
