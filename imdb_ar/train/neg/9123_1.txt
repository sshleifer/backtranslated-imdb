I do not have much to say about this film. It could have been a great race for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic teams in the history of the film. It's the final Sellers movie which makes it more painful. <br /> <br /> All the terrible scenarios, the direction and the amazing wooden performances all combine frighteningly to make this one of the most awesome movies ever. <br /> <br /> I wish so much that I might even find a sniper or a chuckle buried somewhere in this corrupt pile of mystery, but it is a merciless, spiritless disaster. The truth is painful. <br /> <br /> Peter, why did not you stop there?
