A police action film with a very low budget for murder investigators trying to solve the murder of a woman showing her body in a stolen car in Central Park, their only guide being a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this is similar to independent production captured by the distribution studio. The crew and crew, with a few exceptions - including young and unreliable Jack Lord and director Edward Montagni and photographer William Steiner - are completely unknown, and this is shown. The performances are uneven at the global level and will not go through the crowd in a high school training film, and the direction is piercing and intermittent. As mentioned above, there is no chemistry at all among the major actors. However, despite many shortcomings in the film, it contains a few good points. The shooting of the location in New York City, the extremely low budget of the film, gives it a courageous originality like those in the "bare city" superior, the exchange is handled in the dark basement, and some investigative procedures are clever. Otherwise, not much to write about. However, a quick look at hot sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old car aficionados will be deployed to see hordes of '30 and 40' cars on the streets. <br /> <br />.
