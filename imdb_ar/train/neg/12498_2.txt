This film has a really good story. The work of men and women Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the work of heroes and legends. This film captures a good story with three ends (nothing satisfactory), two unnecessary and senseless battles, and two alleged "romantic" relationships that spark the deadly fire. Rescue scenes are wonderful - even if computer generation is undesirable and scenarios are somewhat unrealistic - but the back story is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his proxy hand (he watched it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard's seafarers in the rescue center and she is in the camera for two minutes in the entire film. It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one!
