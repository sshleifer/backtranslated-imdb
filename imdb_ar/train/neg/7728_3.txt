This miniature does not improve with age. I've seen this a supplement when you originally broadcast, and like many others have been blown up. In early 2002, I borrowed novels for WOW, W, and R and were more impressed. Then I decided that I had to see it again and invest $ 200 on DVD sets. I saw the duo again with painful details and realized I had done things backwards - I had to buy novels and borrow DVDs. <br /> <br /> Do not you think this is a serious mistake? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not think this is a historian? Check it out for someone who is not old enough to see it broadcast in the original and watch the reaction you get (warning - reactions from these people range from horror looks to belly laughter). <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section of this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali McGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production quality, music recording, dialogue - a wonderful story turned into an opera from the late 1970s by an overly ambitious producer / director on his head. This thing was dated the moment it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two duets were great at the original broadcast and for those who saw them afterwards, strained in a nostalgic chain reminiscent of the young days. IMO - This miniature does not live up to its reputation and is very disappointed.
