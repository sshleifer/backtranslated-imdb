Wow, how bad you can get it. This was so bad. Not in terms of gravity - which was CGI laughably - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was scary - the main character arc in front was a complete joke. Within a few nights of stalking Finney, he began to become "haunted" to the point of crying when filming his girlfriend. Or are all New York photographers childish and meaningless? The development of his character has no justification or point at all - and eventually he will laugh out loud at what is entirely predictable, and his character turns to total indifference. <br /> <br /> The great moments were quite clear a weak and self-worth effort to stand on the modern GTO MTV wagon - all this blood, there is no real emotion at all. These parts were unintentionally funny - distracted from her consciousness - alien camera angles etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this film commits the crime of blowing up another possible idea. What could have been the atmosphere (even the stupid monsters in the end) was destroyed in favor of "a look at the self-direction awareness pattern." This film was not produced for the public - it was made for autobiography - it was a deeply selfish motivator.
