I think that's almost all I want to say. I feel compelled to explain my actions though. I have never seen such a production of reinforcing steel, that is, with all the meaning of the word. Although it works with a physical camera, running the booming MIC and other technical aspects of this film is laughable, but unfortunately, it is not the only area. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of the classic independent movies that have been saved through their descriptions and wonderful schemes, this unfortunately contains a terrible scenario, terrible representation and worst of all, horrible disturbing characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime for every independent movie to be distributed, like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other independent films that died by silent death. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony, but that could be my only explanation of how this amateur family's production is distributed at all. I was very upset about why they chose this. <br /> <br /> The only part of this film that carries any intrigue is its title. However, the reason is so let down. I hope this review will save a small number of people who might be interested in this movie title from watching it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I'm very tolerant when I'm in the cinema, but that was a lot. I will never forget the "tunnel", because it represents an important point in my experience in cinema. Shame it's a low point.
