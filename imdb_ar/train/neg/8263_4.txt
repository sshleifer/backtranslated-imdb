"Mojo" is the story of the fifties in London, a world of emerging rock stars, violence and forced sexual homosexuality. Mogu uses a method of filming the 1950s, often seen in films that emphasize physical differences with our time, but they also represent dialogue in a very exaggerated manner (largely due to the way in which films were represented in films made during that period) ); I have no idea whether people have already talked like this outside the movies, but no films have been produced today and set in contemporary times using this designed language. It seems as if the stolen speech of the scriptwriter in the 1950s serves a common acronym for a past that seems to be a very distant country, and therefore, particularly, rather than global, emphasis on the story. Mojo has a strong performance from Ian Hart and an annoying performance by Eden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, where the latter is still struggling to build a post-stamped career. But looks like a piece of the period, a modern film inexplicably structured in an outdated language. Rather boring, in fact.
