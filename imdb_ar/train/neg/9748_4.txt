The title alone (along with the poster) is enough to give up "The Projected Man" as a clear presentation of "The Fly". Bryant Haliday, although it is much better than the typical IMDb review that you think is not an idea of ​​an acceptable attitude to Vincent Price. Still, think about it, who would be, unless Michael Goff was available? However, if you are in a mood to watch a movie like the British "Hammer" with a science fiction theme about the teleport experience, it has become a terrible mistake ... well, you may still want to give "The Projected Man" a pass and search around. The "remaining" box at Wal-Mart's local film is another accident accident. Since this was not quite good. <br /> <br /> Haliday has discovered many good tunes from the MST3K crew for his role in this film and in "Devil Doll", but in fact it is the best thing in the TPM. He may not be able to carry the film, but he does not practically get help from the script. The script hangs any momentum forward that may have a plot in the quagmire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a person named Limbach and some evil gangs who want to fail the teleport so they can steal their secrets ... or something. So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of the film include either phone calls or special unconvincing effects with transparent espresso machines and remote transport mice. Then, when the poor Hulidi is mutilated by his machine, he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaphragm more than half of his face and rubber cement on the rest while many Londoners struggle. Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts could not use the horns to make this film work. <br /> <br /> At the same time, all other actors are trying hard to inject life and attention into their roles in this small, ruthless project, but the film's scenario swallows its entire effort. The corrupt official frees the vapors and whispers in the phone to the bastard, while failing to notice that he looks like a wolf wearing a tweed suit and a Tattersall jacket. Hildeigh, research assistant and his former girlfriend, has the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema. His secretary had to walk around her "young". None of it really works or gels in a real movie. It all stops dying, leaving the viewer, "Ah, let me down, was not there supposed to be an end here?" <br /> <br /> However, despite all of its problems, I can easily rename dozens of horror movies from the same period that were bad or worse, as well as anyone else watching movies (or surfed IMDb "down 100") . In fact, I will not pay the money to own an "expected man," but if it's included in some assemblies as well as dozens of other movies in the DVD set, I'm likely to feel good about getting them. It is a harmless conversion, ideal for a horror film, to watch with friends while eating lots of beer and snacks on Saturday evening.
