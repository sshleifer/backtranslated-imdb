A fictional film (based on a story though it contains a "documented by" credit) about a group of scientists going to Prairie Canada to try to find Bigfoot. Device). Much of the scientific mambo jumbo blends into a truly boring film for a group of people wandering the wild. There are some attempts to raise tension and fear, but to be absolutely honest, there is nothing worth seeing outside some of the wonderful shots that appear in the wild. This is a perfect definition of a movie exploit, it promises you a lot, by looking at Bigfoot, but it actually offers very little. Recommended for insomnia only
