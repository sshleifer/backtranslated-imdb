I remember watching the attack when it first appeared and caught up again recently. The science fiction channel is going worse, but not too much. From the shameful stands in the Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces inactive cats of dinosaurs. They are in a loose position, devouring as many additions as possible. CGI too bad, close to funny artificial cat headers. We get some gore, which helps a bit. Wait until you see how the crazy world gets it that started this whole mess. Unlike Robert Carradine, who has little to do, the cast is unknown. This seems to have been shot in Fiji. Good work that I've got to get. Reminds me of all those low budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
