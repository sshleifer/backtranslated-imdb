I think if you're in science fiction and horror stuff it might be interesting. The acting was okay but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be 15, but they are playing older actors who turn out to be twenty-first. The plot is fine, but the story jumps a bit, leaving no one guessing whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. It seems that the priest uses the speed of torsion between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a secret cult to investigate events that occur only to those of faith. What if the girls were Protestant? Do Catholics care? So some are contrived. Who knows, one day the Catholic Church may learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, you do not feel lost.
