The documentary about Eva Moses Corr, a survivor of the Holocaust, part of Mengel's experiments on twins, consists mainly of her account of what happened in Auschwitz, and compared to the emotions of other survivors of the twin experiments. Obviously the film had fantastic ratings. It is one of those subjects in which no one dares to express a dissenting opinion. <br /> <br /> I too, for a large part of the film, absorbed the emotions that the filmmaker wanted to clear the viewer to focus on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously he does not have anything important to say about the problem in a public forum) can only find nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argued with Kor in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" Sameh "was discussed, but the isolated and superior Kor was carrying it," but by this time, I maintained that the film was on a sleeping emotional repertoire I have left enough to see clearly again. After Eva Core's "strong will" forgave her "Nazi kidnappers," the film begins to delve into the theme of tolerance, at least from the point of view of Cor. The film continues to be followed, following its public statement, which forgave the Nazis and a new land. To me, this was the flesh of the film, surrounded by an inedible fat from the "act of forgiveness." Obviously she was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test the theory of forgiveness, to heal the wounds of the past, they are making their way to the "Promised Land" to meet some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues they face and to see if dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation. Frequently discussed and discussed with Jews in the United States about her act of Nazi tolerance, including one in a Jewish center in Chicago. From then on, no one will be so indifferent to tears that he can not see the screen very difficult to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements. <br /> <br /> First, she immediately noticed her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments about her fear of being kidnapped illustrate how much time, effort and money the entire act has been wasted. Dr. Sami Adfan (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem) feels somewhat upset when he tells Core about his statement about how she prefers to be asleep in her apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, a discussion at the Jewish Center in Chicago, where it was "grilled" about the meaning and right of forgiveness, in the wake of those who continue to suffer from the shock of acts. <br /> <br /> You will cut to chase. By the end of the film, I hoped I would not choose to watch the film. The film was badly produced, and failed to go into anything about Auschwitz, apart from purely trivial, just to make sure that the Holocaust is revived in the memory of the viewers and to provoke a shower of tears. He showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary, was unable to engage in a fair debate. Her discussion abilities were limited to the parrot of her position of forgiveness (at best) for not wanting to hear or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone is so backward today that they can not see the difference between making peace and tolerance? Quoting another IMDb user, "I do not see that her remission is weak - on the contrary, she just wanted to ease her grip on her soul, she wanted the suffering to end, so she let her go." That would be the definition of the ideal person to make peace. <br /> <br /> I believe that in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room for questioning those who "passed through more than man" can be understood by the mind. <br /> <br /> PS The dictionary Definitely go to all the purchase books lists that everyone keeps.
