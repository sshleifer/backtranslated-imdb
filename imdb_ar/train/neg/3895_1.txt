Once, some bad guys filmed a movie about a person shot in space, supposed to go to Saturn, but in fact only to some radioactive snapshots of solar flares, then bleeds from his nose, and before you know it, he is put in a hospital dresser From head to foot, then comes an overweight nurse eaten by a man, who is supposed to melt everywhere but does not seem to lose any mass, then NASA, or at least one person at NASA, gets upset about it and calls someone else To chase him, but the man who sent him to hunt the dissolved man must go home and eat the soup first, and forgot his wife Strange crackers, so he can not get the crackers, then he go out and look for the solute geiger, this does not really work, so he only follows the effect of the carcasses eaten half aft, then there is something about sheriff, two ugly older in a grove Lemon, a woman with meat cleaver, and a kind of industrial factory with security guards happy with the trigger, and since I can not tell you how the movies end, all I can say is that Jonathan Demi is somewhere with someone named Port Deppening stupid, Any justice in the world, every person associated with this film died with a miserable and violent death and could not Produce more movies, and the world has lived happily ever after - the end!
