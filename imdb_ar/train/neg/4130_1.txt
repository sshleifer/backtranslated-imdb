A top rival for the worst film ever. It seems that the character of Joanna Bacula has a certificate of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director. It was not a high school script script scenario; "jokes" are events; a tacky concept. It is clear that these artists were desperate to work. I stayed until the end just to see if it would get worse. I did. Life is too short to spend any part of it watching this movie.
