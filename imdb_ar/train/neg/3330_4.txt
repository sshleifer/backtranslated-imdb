This film is characterized by the approval of the result and not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The start and end credits with most actors and "special effects" appear to be a low budget film. There is nothing in this movie that you can not find in a crazy world or horror movies / comedy or low budget movies. It is not special for any naked scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. This film is simply here. Ann Ramsay and Felice Diller are also enthusiastic. If you are as curious as you are and I can find it already, you will realize the fact of one line summary.
