When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Such as Harvey Girls. it's not. It's a pudding overcook, hit the kitchen roof, and was dismantled together. There is no music and it is not part of a period but it is quite unlikely. <br /> <br /> It starts with Patriarch James Woods to tell his three biggest daughters, a young boy growing up to be Barbara Stanwyck, to keep the family name. And home. <br /> <br /> Thus, we believe it will be a historical story between generations. That is, briefly. Then turns into a strong Stanoyak fighting story against attorney George Brent. Why are the dead group too against him? okay, why? As we learned in a strange sequence of the flashback from Stanwyck's novel, she once thought that she could inherit some money (for her sisters and herself, of course) through marriage. I hit someone who took him to be the beak of the country, which was actually inventing Brent's lawyer. <br /> <br /> For fear that someone would think that the child had, a boy aged eight years or so at the time of the main plot, - - Well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage and in the very short time that They were together, was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters adores a painter named Gig Young, who plays Jeju Young. The other sister is trying to take him. Etc., <br /> <br /> It is a mess, not working well - behaved well enough but without reason or reasonableness.
