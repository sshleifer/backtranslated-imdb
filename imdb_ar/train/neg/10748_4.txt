Nothing to say only wow! Has anyone infiltrated them in an open field? Well, this happens about 25 times in this movie (obviously a favorite scare tactic for directors). In one of the opening scenes, a nice, modern / hot imaging product has to ride in the back seat until the camera man sits in the foreground to shoot. Shortly after arriving at the field, the five contestants appear, and although it is clear that at least in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun will shine at any minute. After about 30 minutes of stale garbage, we enjoy memories of the history of the clown who see some of his former victims. If you see this movie check the ladies' box. Her ribs were running up her neck. It was disgusting. Most horror movies occur during the night but without a night vision camera, the chaos is forced to occur during the day. The few night shots that made her enter the film seem to have been stolen from the Blair witch project or random footage from the backyard of the director. The film eventually recovered somewhat when there was a matrix like a shoot with the clown who we replay and watch over and over hysterically. <br /> <br /> Certainly, rent this movie if you have fun in an open field. <br /> <br /> The answer was signed
