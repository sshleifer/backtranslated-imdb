This is one of those movies that you and a group of friends are sitting around drinking and eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately, I found myself watching this on my own. I and my friends have hired a large selection of films and we have never been able to see this film. I was supposed to come back and I said it was a waste not to see it. I did, and I was impressed by the magnificence of this film. <br /> <br /> Now, I like the bad movies a bit and maybe you would love this movie if the "hero" is not very hateful. The entire movie I hoped he would put this stupid sword and invite someone to kill him! He does heroic things in the film. It's fat, disgusting, stupid thing. He has lesser quality qualities than bad guys do. And what was with all the bare chicks? I mean I like nude chicks just like the next guy, but this movie went abroad in this section. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand a "disgusting hero" then I'm sure you'll like this episode of the movie.
