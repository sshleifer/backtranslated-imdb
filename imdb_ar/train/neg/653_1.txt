If I can give this film a real assessment, it is likely to be understated. Although I respect the fact that someone should continue to make horrible "horror" movies, buying a ticket to this movie seriously is a waste of money you might spend on something that is worth a lot of your time. Although it is a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of ​​seeing the number of terrifying cliches you can put in a single movie frightens you. If the rating is higher, it is likely to have made for a better film in the long term. <br /> <br /> Making this version of "Night Concert" has been violated. Representatives may have done a good job if it was not questionable. This was a terrible waste of a movie trip. I would sooner go and see "one missed call" again, at least there were some conspiracies.
