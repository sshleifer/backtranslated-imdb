I just got the 4-cylinder UK version of Superman 1 for about $ 5. Additional elements include 1951 Superman and Mole-Men. So, you hit it on the DVD player last night, and here are my findings. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment - I did not check it, and I think it was mentally marked as one of the Kirk Alyn series. I'm not a fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I've seen nothing but Kirk Allen's strange passage - but hey, I do not mind. <br /> <br /> This black and white production works for less than an hour. He feels two episodes of the early TV series Reeves, a two-part segment that was set up to produce the film, although IMDb says it was filmed as a film version before the first television series. In any case, it is a strange choice for reasons I will return to later. I'm in an age when I remember television and film productions that were limited to one or two sites and groups, so there were no big surprises here. However, for the low-budget film, this film has a really low budget. <br /> <br /> The story is about the small town of Silsby - a population of 1430 - which is also, perplexingly, also home to the deepest oil well in the world (6 miles) The story begins with the foreman of the well, who takes steps hastily to close the well. This contradicts the arrival of the Metropolis and Kent reporters to report the well, at the request of the oil company. While Clark inhales the fact that the exercises appeared in a radiant cave down six miles away, a pair of strange young men (small, large in the head, black in a suit, heavy iron in the eyebrow) of the covered drill tool, begin to calm around the city in expressions Confused. <br /> <br /> A deep breath now, this is the remaining plot of the picture. Young men are afraid of some children, so Jeff Currie (who plays the role of xenophobia in the city) urges some colleagues to kill these "creatures". Superman intervenes (somewhat ineffective) and picks up one of the young men who was shot and taken to the local hospital. Korean flowers are burning in the hut, and her other little colleague has hidden her and assumed he was killed, but he escapes and inserts him down the column. Corrie incites the mob (although the police chief arrests him) to suspend Mole-man in the hospital. Superman prevents them from entering the hospital and takes the injured man to the column to bring him back to his colleagues. There are a total of 4 men who have a weapon of the type that shoots Jeff Currie (I call it Aargh! Because its only effect is to make Core go "Aargh!") And Superman saves it. He changed his ways immediately because of his surprise at Superman to save him after the way he acted, and the mole back down the column. End. <br /> <br /> Although the movie takes only one hour, there is a tremendous amount of crawling, caution and follow-up - you have left all "Mole-Man 1 crawls from A to B, looking to make sure nobody is following" things . Moles do not engage in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they come, persecute and return. They look a bit creepy, but they are barely the thorny monsters that the city's reaction requires. <br /> <br /> Reeves is very good for Kenneth Clark - he is a pretty solid reporter, much more than Phillice Coates and Lynn Lane are indifferent. But Superman is Terrible Terrible. Not only is he not looking at the part (at least his hair dyed black in this, an improvement of somewhat light hair in some TV episodes), the way he plays everything wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to "hit" (which Superman does consistently), but someone should have told him that he should have a grip on the hips, not a grip on the ribs. He plays Superman as a stern and somewhat touching teacher - he does not actually shake his finger at a demonstration, but he may have. <br /> <br /> Superman takes a huge amount of walking (I say a lot - he's not really much), and a bit of jogging. It starts and falls several times, but is not seen while flying at any time. Oh, some bullets bounce on it, telescopic vision is used like Clark, but without any visual effect companion. In fact, the visual effects are obvious because of their absence, and few of them are very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to think about this effort by referring to time standards: but even through those criteria, I think it's a great effort. Fortunately, the production standards in the TV series were higher, and at least they had trouble coming out with stories they had a little more. <br /> <br /> Something of a disappointment - I will not see it again.
