My friend bought the movie for 5? (Not worth up to a cent), because they wrote it was like an American pancake. But soon we will know that there is a long way from the American pie to that nonsense. It's not even a comedy, it's like a really bad documentary. Not only is the story bad, sound and sound also suck. They put in some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and teenagers drunk. The result is a disaster. If you see this movie, do not buy it, but spend your money on something else, and better. If you torture yourself, do not let your friend / friends, unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
