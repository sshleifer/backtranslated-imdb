I must say that many people have argued that some of us need to deal with time because the new movie "Dukes" is a modern version. I beg you. If this is what you're thinking of updating, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site also said (and quote) "You must overcome the old bad guys except what is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24 years old, so I'm out of existence and the old FOGIE, and I will not beat it, has been a nuisance to all this dangerous boycott. The only correct thing in the title of the film was "Hazard". Were all profanity, smoking and drinking really necessary? The cast was terrible. Jessica participated in many morning programs to discuss the film and frankly I think all of this has reached her head. The daisy is by no means a Duke, maybe luck, but definitely not a Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not Bo. They should have included at least the original actors in the inscription, but even Hollywood knew they would not agree with the script. I mean, come to people, even actors and actresses today express a negative opinion, so why do some of you make positive remarks?
