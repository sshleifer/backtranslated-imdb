I must admit that "re-imagining" the original 1968 film was a great disappointment. Especially when this film is taken into consideration by Tim Burton. He is one of the most original people, and I say, he produced wonderful Hollywood producers. <br /> <br /> I personally admire his work, but it is clear that there is something wrong with the last flick, The Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original movie. When people first came out, they just expected another Cheesy 70 science fiction film, but a big surprise proved the theory. It already had a clear message. A clear anti-war message. The fear of the Cold War was played, as it took the world and the fear of using nuclear weapons a big role in the mind of filmmakers. These reasons made the film rise above all expectations and became classically immediate. Although the new film, "remake" or anything, leaves us nothing. No message, no ideals behind it. It's just another summer game full of money. <br /> <br /> Visually Tim Burton does not let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the makeup was great. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not enough to keep people interested in the film. There must be an intriguing plot or story. In this film, the plot is not very interesting and is thought very badly. The script is very lame and full of gaps. This film seems to have been hastily written. The explanation of why there are monkeys there, and why the rule of the planet was so stupid and proved the ignorance of the screenwriter. <br /> <br /> He raised many questions, which did not have reasonable answers to them. <br /> <br /> For example, why did monkeys speak English? , Why were there other types of non-chimpanzees on the planet (given that there was only a chimpanzee in the spacecraft that landed on the planet) Where did all the hell come from these humans? How a few chimpanzees evolved into a huge group of all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years. (I mean it took a few million years to evolve from a monkey to a human being!) Finally, the bad end was just stupid on the plane. Perhaps it was just put forward because the original film had such an ending, and then they felt that the audience expected the same kind of finish. The end also raises a lot of questions, which I know, do not have smart answers. Did you know the tidal work on the spaceship? , Which was less capable, learned to return in time and control the land with one hand ?, and what did he do, breed with all women? Let's say that will happen, and I doubt strongly that history will remain as it is, like Washington will be built as it is today completely! (I mean, there is not a huge banana instead of a memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something positive about the film. Some of the cast were fantastic. The character of Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well represented, such as Tim Roth as Thade. He was very good, and he felt some saturation at some point in the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Mark and Leberg. He is not much represented, and he plays a very less masculine character here. It is unbelievable and nothing compared to the character of Hyston originally. The main female character has no reason or place in the film. The lights were just cast. I rarely said a word throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that in the future when people think of the Planet of the Apes, they will think of the original film. You will soon be forgetting the latest.
