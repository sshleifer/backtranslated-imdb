Mr. Mike may have been the worst comedian of all time, so I was interested in seeing what he would do with full control of the film. Unfortunately, this is insurmountable, but not because jokes are not funny - some of them (I will not say more), and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unstable screed into visual glasses. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, whatever you like) is very impressive, and the film is unbearable. Some groups, called "PKO Productions", get credit for the product, but they do not seem productive at all; it looks like Mike stole one of the SNL cameras and made it all in the afternoon. I realized Mike's goal was to torture the public, but even that deserved some basic criteria, such as the ability to see, hear or understand anything that was supposed to be shocking. However, the DVD does not represent a complete loss: it includes a tribute to Audonog of Bill Murray and three "Mike's Stories for the Shortest Time of Sleep" from the SNL. In addition, the "Cat Swimming" section of the movie is a great sight to see if you want to scare someone. 10/03
