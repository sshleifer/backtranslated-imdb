The National Security Agency, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all the other SNOP agencies in the world must watch this movie for information on how to spy on people. (As commented in MST3k, ... "Sanata has dirt on all! Santa Tentacles up to a wide distance! There is no hiding from Klaus") <br /> <br /> From telescopes that can spy on millions of miles To ears you can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa on payroll. <br /> <br /> The devil's routine is in hilarious dance. The pitch ... is useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is enormous. Very low budget but very enjoyable to watch. I recommend watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 for more laughter. <br /> <br /> You can even laugh at the bad luck of good children. <br /> <br /> I offer this one for quality production and 10 for pure cheese and a fun factor.
