I read one of the other reviews that expressed the view that the "platoon" was a never ending episode of marines killing people, killing, taking drugs and talking about garbage. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with that because the film was actually more than that, but somehow, I can see what this person is trying to say: This was not a real conspiracy - a point I agree with. <br /> <br /> It is a stone immersed in itself the best. He really wanted to show, not only how the war led to death, but also to what extent they were severely shocked by those who survived. Unfortunately, the film seems to have "glorified" this aspect, and the big end is just a champagne, stand-alone, Oscar-winning "to create a permanent image" to my liking. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers like him is that they fail to understand this simple concept: the murderous, lethal murder of a murderer that war does not prove or even reflect on whether it is an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing now with Iraq. If this point is lost, let me make it plain: If you see how bloody World War II was and how devastating the lives of the surviving soldiers were, do you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, why would the images of Vietnam's atrocities convince you that it is wrong to go to war in that case? <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to wage war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not support the theory that "this war is wrong because people died and suffered." I do not think the motives are always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> This does not mean anything about the fact that the end or the final big "twist" was a bit stupid. However, this is not the first stone departure. Wall Street was a wonderful film, until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a terrible "turn of the century". JFK may have been one of the few movies that Stone has actually finished very well. <br /> <br /> But this is hardly important in this film because there was little plot until this point of the film is distorted. That is why I gave it a low mark. It was practically less storytelling and ultimately boring - unless it fell due to artificial brilliance.
