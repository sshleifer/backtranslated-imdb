There was something here with a female leadership that had this perfect life that she always wanted after the worst possible life, ranging from a girl whore and ending up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Kane and this ultimately destroys him. This sounds strange, but I like the position that Dean Kane had in the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt him because he loves her and he is the mother of his child (I think the time frame shows that he is his child and not his brother), but at the same time he can not forgive her for everything she did, sleeping with his brother (who shows the love and commitment he felt was one way to Largely) and then being part of his death. In better hands, this was a better film, but for something caught on late at night, not bad.
