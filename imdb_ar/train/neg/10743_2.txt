This film is really bad, contains a script full of "unforgettable" lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (and not the worst effects I have seen, too) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it for its endorsement. Only two short themes (30 seconds or so) are repeated throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
