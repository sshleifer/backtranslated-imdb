I wanted to read the other comments before I left my assessment and that the rules of the majority certainly: this film is wonderful! From acting to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. I actually hoped that the paintings were stretched out by imagination (the paintings could not be stretched without engines). The landing gear can only be lowered if you have electricity. That very small fan that was not enough by any means to lower the landing rate. The only thing I thought was that it was very strange when it landed, the rear wheels fell and then the nose exploded, resulting in the aircraft being suspended with the tires back in the air. How did the captain use the left and right brakes on tires that did not touch the ground? Have they forgotten the spoilers? A word for the director: Discover all you can about the planes before trying the movie "The Plane". Sorry for the artistic rant, but I give this movie 1/10.
