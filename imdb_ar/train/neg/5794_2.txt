All Germans stand out in the open and get a machine gun. The good guys never die, unless it's for exciting purposes. "The Plot" has a lot of funny holes. (Where did the German soldiers go as soon as the fuel tank rolled over to the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) The whole idea, a train hijacking? How stupid is this! The Germans know where you are going, it's not like you can leave the track and get away! O wasteful. I better jump myself on the head with a big hammer 10 times and then have to sit back. I mean, seriously, I felt it was made in the 1960s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! Team A is more credulous than this terrible excuse for the film. Just watch it if you need to laugh well. This film is for Tilly Seivalas what was the green beret for John Wayne.
