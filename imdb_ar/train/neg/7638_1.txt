I could not even bring myself to watch this movie until the end. I can not comment on the story because I did not watch the entire film and the reason I could not see it was because of the "cast". First, most of them seemed solid and I'm sure their texts were completely out of the box - but that's a simple problem. The main issue I face with actors is not really their fault ... It's the one who casts this film! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought that choosing people in their late twenties to play teenagers had come out of fashion with a new wave?! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, from an older man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Do not fall victim to this movie, walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this movie can offer.
