The DVD was a joke, the sound in the first few minutes was terrible, the sound was out of sync and the Segals sound, not even his voice !!!! Pathetic! When the audio sync is better in about 5 minutes, the plot, the lines and the poor actors must get another job because the action of the films is not where they should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good movies in the early days, the latest was a joke and should be embarrassing for him and for the company I made. <br /> <br /> If Segal is the one who has dealt with this, it is better to return to having another party running the show, because he has no talent at all in this. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment to all those involved in its production and a disgrace to all who have seen it. I stopped it in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask for my money back in Block Buster! Mark of Ontario, Canada
