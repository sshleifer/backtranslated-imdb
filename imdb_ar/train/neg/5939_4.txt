I thought the film was fine but I was very disappointed because they did not pick up the real picture of his life. I was expecting to see his mother an actual Jamaican, which drove me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the film told me that the film was not accurate. Which was completely lost seconds after the movie began. I'm very disappointed, like watching the story of Mark Anthony's autobiography and playing Arnold's role. I do not know what the writer was thinking about losing an important part of the film, and I'm sure his mother played a big role in his life. I will say that the movie was good besides Fla Home !!!!!!
