After what I thought was a masterful performance of a tour in Man From Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in sequel? It was not so without Spears and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. Perhaps he realized how poor the plot was - Jim returns after a long absence, to find that Jessica is being stalked by another man. He did not expect any girl to wait that long without any contact from him, and no competition. For the Disney film, this contains foul language, as well as the most unnecessary part when Jim and Jessica went unmarried - very lame. Insult to viewers, according to members of my family. I will commit to the first one, and I try to forget that I saw the sequel!
