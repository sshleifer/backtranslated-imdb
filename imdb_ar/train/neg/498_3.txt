I saw this movie when I was younger and I thought it was funny. I saw him again last week and you can guess the result. Some funny parts in it, very few and very long. The start is the only funny thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a full b movie, this is a good choice, but do not expect much of the size of the dwarf aliens
