Two qualifiers up front: I actually think that Joe Don Becker can be good or even fantastic with the right stuff and the right director ("Cape Fear", a small role in "Goldeneye" and "Walking Tall"). I liked Becker in the movie "Mitchell", because he was playing a hostile hero that was supposed to be undesirable. Yes, the MST3K coverage was Farhana, but they picked up lots of cheap footage at Baker - it was not worth it - to keep things lively and entertaining - it was appropriate for the level and tone of the film and was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Final justice" appears to be more than the same, but despite the bizarre sites and the "border cowboy border" theme, it is slightly weaker than Mitchell's. The main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film tells that because of Becker's embodiment of the old style of boundaries, he challenges his opponents in the fast-paced Mano style draw. Because he is very strong and masculine, he always wins, even when he hurts, wounds or exceeds them, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a conceited perception of a lot of potential (he worked for Gary Cooper), even if he owes the film to put the movie "B". But Baker is so frightening and stupid that he unnecessarily defies three evil followers in a public market confrontation, with civilians everywhere. He simply managed to shove them into the headquarters of the evil leader (which is why he was followed in the first place) and never noticed him. Or he could have got them and forced them to surrender, and got one of his followers to take him to headquarters at gunpoint. But no, he must be a hot dog in the literary league, a barrier intrigued by the grudge, and then take a child hostage in the ensuing shootout! <br /> <br /> Is this the man you are supposed to admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most supporting actors are somewhere between OK (followers) and good (the main villain and his father, two well-known European representatives - only go to suggestions, but they are accountants and even hinder them. But through all this, Becker's personality derives from the absurd, fruitless and absurd acts that have killed at least two innocent people, as well as two bad guys who may have been transported alive without the use of lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film is on display in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you will see many beautiful views and lots of nice and exotic additions. In fact, Baker may be on the heavy side and slightly indigestible, but not so bad ... and certainly not the incentive that critics of these films (including Mike and the bots in their funny coverage) seem to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is useful for the background of the video, but the viewer should not care about it.
