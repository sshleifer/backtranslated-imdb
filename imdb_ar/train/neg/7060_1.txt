This awesome movie characters are absolutely incredible, and wildly inconsistent. The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are worth the fun and prepare for the uncomfortable viewing. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and the description indicates that this film was written by high school students, but the sheer lack of credibility of the school environment may suggest that writers may never have gone to high school. The acting in most cases was also weak, although much of this was due to the text and bad scheme, I'm not sure that any actors could have made this film a spectacle. <br /> <br /> After I said that the track sound was fine, and the filming was nice in some places (although editing was bad).
