Oh God, what a stupid film! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature played by one person in a lame outfit) and a stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (ha ha ha!) ... are simply ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such troublesome characters as such junk (those dumb children or pregnant women with their spouse and others). All in all, this is a wonderful entertainment if you are drunk. Avoid it like a plague. I'm Drunk? I do not think so ...
