There was no description in this film and really shows how much this anonymous breakthrough needs to be directed to learn his career. All his characters in this film were very unpopular and I could have cared less. The best point in this film was the final credit and the one hour shower after that reason I felt so damned hot that I wasted money on this stinking pregnancy. Hey genius ... trio and yakuza from two different places learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so touched and useless. This DVD proved to be useful because I love the new coastery. <br /> <br /> So that children do not waste your money on this appeal, which buys the youth hostel instead.
