This was a strange film. I started very good. A powerful audio track behind the flashy images of chaos and chaos as our mind did. <br /> <br /> Then comes his "downfall", and here I can tell me that I was in a real cheesy B movie. Weak representation, I mean, how difficult it is to take up arms and act as a policeman? These guys can not. After the scene of the death of our psychopath, we get the opening credit, and the film begins ... <br /> <br /> From this point, the breasts are big bad, the blood spilled from time to time and the scenes of death are weak. <br /> <br /> I said that I gave the film four because, despite its flaws, it kept a kind of creeping that I could not get rid of completely. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie but I must admit that I may sound worse.
