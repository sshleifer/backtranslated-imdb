If you have ever seen Dukes of danger, you know that you never have to worry about drugs, sex or rude behavior by young children. If you've watched a movie you know it's no longer the case! This movie was awesome! The main characters that take drugs and think that they are funny and wonderful certainly are not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful offer and turned it into a trash can. Daisy, who was a little gazelle in the original show, now seems to act and act as if in the corner of the street to get money for her services. I was very excited to watch this movie before its introduction, 15 minutes after the film I was ready to leave. I kept thinking that it had to get better but instead it got worse every minute. I wish I had not seen this movie. I broke a good offer and left only the terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor and go see something worth your money, because it is not only a waste of money but a waste of two hours of your life that you will never return!
