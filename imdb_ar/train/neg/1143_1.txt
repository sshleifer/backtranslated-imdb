Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission emerged as the worst film I've ever seen. The Scandinavian ninja silently enters into a scene, firing its hateful machine guns with difficulty as it abandons wildlife, and then leaves silently. Wow, how will we find these silent silent killers? Just follow the shells of shells and smoke! A very bad dialogue (or was it wonderful and not badly translated?), Not Asian in sight, and a total of 3 Asians among the laborious staff. The plot is silly, the representation is largely absent - then again, the ninja can not act! Save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs!
