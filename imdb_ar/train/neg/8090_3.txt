I am a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partly" because most of his films are divided into two categories: wonderful and boring. Unfortunately, this film falls into the following category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as the recent Miyazaki film "Howl's Moving Castle". An exciting hypothesis was created, but then it was immediately reduced to more than a background of some inexplicable events that only confuse the plot rather than explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the prism - the world is full of energetic story set, and actually looks like a very exciting story about to unfold. Then things go down. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly veiled environmental advertising, and the end is badly distorted by a kind of impenetrable spirituality that destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie looks as if someone has extracted all other pages of the script before passing it on the animation. What remains is something visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was a version of the Nth generation, of poor color - which led to the popular myth that Nosica illustrates below its bottom while flying), but that makes no sense at the end leaving me puzzled Of my order.
