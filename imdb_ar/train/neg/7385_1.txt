The film is boring, characters and scenarios unrealistic and unbelievable, and the movement is fun. This movie is a big mess. It looks as if when you start the excitement music, the most impressive game will work. Either to be named Mr. McGregor's voice or Steven sung a lot and changed his voice. There is a lot of dialogue in this film, and very bad on behalf of everyone. The movie is a great treat for sleeping. Funny fighting. The effect of eye shape transformation on female designed drug addiction was decent evil. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through questioning, and he just threw random plots such as (spoiler) "CTX (medicine designed for him) would be in the water supply" that was not addressed in conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
