There are many stupid moments in the "Tower of Death" / "Game of Death 2" so much that you really wonder if it's a parody. Sometimes, I felt like watching a sequel to Kung Pow instead of Bruce Lee. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film has a full connection to "Game of Death". If anything, it is more a supplement / remake of "Enter the Dragon", which includes many elements of this movie - especially the actual footage. Personality Bruce Lee, Billy Leigh (apparently) investigate the sudden death of his friend and face a piece of the movie left with the daughter of the man. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and depends on his lost brother revenge for the death of the two men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long stars as his brother Bobby Lu and does not really have that kind of charisma to carry the movie. His combat abilities are very good however. It is clear that Bruce Lee appeared thanks to (no longer) deleted footage just to take advantage of the legacy. If we say, in general, the footage is actually better edited than "Game of Death" but does not prevent the film from being a mess. <br /> <br /> Well, so the fights are actually very entertaining (I dare to say the mind) and make the film at least a walk. But there are many elements of this movie that really test your patience. First, there is the supposed villain who lives in his astral property ... Or is this mental institution? Seriously, he eats the raw venison nut, drinks the blood of the deer, carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and black (?!). This attempt to make him appear stern and smart makes you feel sorry for him - half expecting someone to accompany him to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle section is terrible and when the scene includes a naked hooker hook and Lion's suit I turn it off. However, I finished the film and was happy because I loved fighting because the end was close to watching it (like "GOD"). Although the story is embarrassing, the procedure is very good and has excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But until the end they disappear if the hypothesis is anything that can go on. What we were told was that the "Tower of Death" was a temple that was upside down and underground. This looked great, like the evolution of Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on every level. Could it be a "death game" that was originally planned? No! The movie was supposed to be called "Generator Room of Death" because this is the tower. Yes, there was already one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts dressed in foil, skinny leopard followers and a stupid monk. It seems like Enter the Dragon was never made, as the plot was a bad tradition. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing once to see the scenes of fast fighting, but sometimes stupid to hurt me. If this is intended, then okay. However, you can recreate the viewing room scene from "Enter The Dragon".
