Let's be honest here: the only reason anyone has to buy this, the only reason to review this person, and the only reason anyone can pretend to enjoy it is that David Lynch did that and because you want to have David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of waste. <br /> <br /> Lynch may have wanted you to go beyond normal life and try the absurd in itself as a mere subject of knowledge. Perhaps the shocking and striking sounds of the movement, and the images of the lawns suggest something about the status of humanity in the world, our relationship with Real, and the absurdity of everything. <br /> <br /> Tell me one thing: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to attack for the attack, I could press Hansen and let my ear bleed. If I wanted to tamper with tampering, I could get rid of a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is one quality to recover Dumbland - it's dead, very funny. That is, it is very bad that it is not funny because it is very bad. But this fact is a little funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, spare yourself torment.
