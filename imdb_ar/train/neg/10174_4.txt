I saw this again in 94 when it was finally released. It seems because Orion's photos were in bankruptcy, I think, the film was not shown two years ago. <br /> <br /> I have a problem remembering details in part because I have not seen them in a long time, but I remember it as a very boring film. I kept discussing whether I would get out of it. The store was not exciting or attractive at all. It was 3rd rate American imitation graffiti. <br /> <br /> Do not make any offers worth seeing. One of the biggest disappointments since local newspaper reporters gave her a high rating.
