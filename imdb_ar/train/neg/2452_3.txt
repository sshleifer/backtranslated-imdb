When I saw this again recently, I found it sad to see how they honestly tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the volatile budget and lean actors meant inevitable failure. In any case, this was a disaster, but I found it easy to imagine how good a Lord of the Rings movie would be if someone made a sincere film - with money to hire the most talented artists and screenwriters. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, it will not be possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> This movie has left me with the impression that with any kind of budget at all, this story simply can not be stuffed up. Fantasy only provides many opportunities for making an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did, although of course you always use your imagination because of poor performance. For example the way they tried to show the world from Frodo's point of view. Or the way Galadril Sam demonstrated what was happening at home to another. <br /> <br /> Something else I really appreciate in this release - silent moments. There were moments when conversation was being talked to with no music in the background with still falling. Compare it with the Jackson-like luxury camera, and the spooky result that seemed designed to emphasize that each scene was the most exciting and powerful scene we've ever seen. Jackson's films were full of their own significance, and this was much calmer and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and his partners achieved more than $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million in marketing, a major tax exemption from the New Zealand government, and also gained huge savings from filming in New Zealand, not in the United States. However, despite marketing allegations, the intention to be sincere never existed. This is well documented. Felipe Bowens said the same in an interview, when she said they deliberately did not reread the books before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to produce a fictional film like the Lord of the Rings, and that the person he really wanted to do was return the king, because he had a lot of fights but had no evolution in personality. . <br /> <br /> In contrast, this movie tried to be more realistic. Of course there were a lot of wrong things, the representation was terrible and everything drowned to a great extent and the pace was extremely fast. Of course, they cut a lot, adapted other scenes, and they deserve credit. While Jackson added a lot of movement scenes that did not serve any purpose of the plot, Bakshi cut scenes of books that did nothing to advance the plot anyway. There is, in fact, a striking similarity between the structure of Jackson and Bakshi's films near the beginning - in that they move away from the original books in the same way - although some of this may of course be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> This was not a good film, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview with Onion AV Club that the only animation is that the Lord can do. His novel did not work, but he was probably right.
