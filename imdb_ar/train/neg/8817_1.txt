No, I have never seen any of the "Santa Slasher" series, "Silent Night, Deadly Night" or "Original Christmas Black" or "Christmas Christmas Evil". I've heard everything about her reputation, or, MADS (moms against stricken Santas.) I thought I'd rent this one as I heard it pop up for reference on the "Fat Guys at the Movies" slide. <br /> <br /> Moms must be against this, but not for the "killer" ooooohhhh, but for the fact that this film was just plain nonsense. Boring, long? So in just 92 minutes, nonsense. <br /> <br /> The little boy sees Santa arriving at a chimney in 1947, delivering gifts, eating some goodies and miraculously, floating the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but he goes back to the living room to see Mama and Santa (somewhat) get it. This seems to have spoiled this child for the rest of his life, although the scene was saturated with steam just as Ralph's father had a "leg lamp" in the Christmas Story. He was very upset, went to the attic, and cut off his hand well. <br /> <br /> Quickly advance into the future! Now, in 1980 the boy works in a toy factory. We get a whiff of being a little outside, chasing both children and parents alike. Who is the naughty, who is gentle, blah blah. It takes a good two thirds of the film to finally carry on the hijacker? As if this is not out of the first frame. The film should not take too long. <br /> <br /> I will admit that this film was tense, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, well, he punishes "Who's the naughty"? It's like a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. I did not mention the end of the WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in fact, it's as weird as the rest of the film. (Take the brother who bothers his brother kills, and solve it? Ah, kill.) Do not open this mess, until Christmas Eve, or evil. Again, I did not see other Santa Salars but this one sucked bad. It's built to thrill because of the nature of the film and never once delivered a decent gift.
