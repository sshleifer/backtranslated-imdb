That's right, I've heard that this movie is a wonderful movie. First, the band, which hell will go to see or listen to a band called "Nude Brothers Band"?!?! The name is not only horrible, but musicians too, they can not even play anything! Also, the main singer appears more daring than Lee Geddy, and even more terrible voice! Not only are they terrible musicians but they are terrible actors. Led by a crappy director and thin filmmaker, this film should be the dumbest film ever. I hope this website allows you to use a ZERO vote or below from 10, because giving this 1/10 filth would be very generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call this comedy. If you are looking for a comedy with music, go to this strange man "Yird Al" Yankovic because he does a much better job than these uneducated young women.
