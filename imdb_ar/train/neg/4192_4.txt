In this short time, an urban man and his wife live their exotic lives in Akimbo's situation when the man in the old red pants suit of his mother takes the law. <br /> <br /> I kept watching this in the hope that I could see why it was made, or why other reviewers found it funny. For me, it was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Everyone's tastes are not the same, but obviously this was not me.
