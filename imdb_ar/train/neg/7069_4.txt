When the film was released, it was his biggest success and soon became Blockbuster. But frankly, the film is a silly hour with a conspiracy glorifying a loser. The film contains a line mark - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" which means Love's Sweet but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrificed his love for the leading lady (Puja Gandhi) even though the two loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the tag line. This film has affected so many broken hearts that they found this "similar loss" attitude a very thoughtful attitude, so the film of worship became the same, when they could move on with their lives. Ganesh acting in the film is an amateur, brawler and stupid child. It seems really funny in the song (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when supposed to look elegant and wonderful. His looks do not help the leading role as well. His hairstyle is bad in most parts of the film. Puja Candy was. Her costumes are appalling in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good part about the film is the excellent cinematography and wonderful music written by Manu Murthy, which is in fact the true grace to save the film. The words of Jayant Kaikini are well submerged. Yograj Bhat should be commended for filming the songs in a delicious way. <br /> <br /> Anyway all in all except the songs, the movie is very normal !!!!!!
