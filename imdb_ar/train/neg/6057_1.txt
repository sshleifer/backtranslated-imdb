Can anyone stop John Carpenter from destroying his reputation continuously and deliberately? To what level can you go down? It seems that this man has lost any respect for himself. <br /> <br /> It looks like this episode has been made by a film student, and it does not even deserve to start talking about what was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent as a film director or without any motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retire immediately with the rest of self-confidence and stop the leakage of waste like a bad tradition of Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Instead, screw it up.
