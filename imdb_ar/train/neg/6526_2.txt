An incompetent film, where the characters stand in rooms or in the rocket ship and talk to infinity. You might think things will float when you explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter, making everything very ambiguous. The landscape of Martian plants consists of drawings and monsters that are not entirely convincing. There are echoes of "The Bride of the Beast" when the hero beat the octopus carefully, like the claws of a meat-eating plant, before it was crushed twice. The difference is that Ed Wood is 100 times more entertaining. It is best to wear earplugs when watching the results of music "sci-fi", which is repeated infinitely, which leads you to madness. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night, just insert this device into a VCR and insomnia will be treated at any one time.
