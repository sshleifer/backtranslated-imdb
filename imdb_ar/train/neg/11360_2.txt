Well, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, I thought it would be good to produce an IMAX film about some flies that settle on Apollo 11 and go to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was a fool. <br /> <br /> I want to offer props to artists to do their homework on hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launchers were blowing. The graphics were generally very good - the launch gave me a chills, as always with a good rocket launch (still the auto mechanics of Popular Mechanics is strong) and the 3D was very effective. CG was not of Pixar quality, but it was generally good. The flies were fairly modest figures, some of whom were cast in the late 1960s on color (hippy flies, African-American flies with giant afros, dark shadows, etc.). The larvae seemed to resemble larvae with the heads of human children Although they have made a particularly heavy crushing noise). <br /> <br /> The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on outdated clich√©s (1960s), including gender politics, including useless female characters, and racist stereotypes , Evil Russians, fat fly who just wants to eat, class II humor total-progressive). In a film aimed at IMAX, they blew up a wonderful opportunity to sneak into some educational content about physics and travel to space - they did not get their physics (zero-g in the moon unit during the burning of the landing? Please, so be annoyed to read the original radio texts between Houston and Roed Space, all in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which looks like nonsense. <br /> <br /> But we loved these larvae. <br /> <br /> So they get a point and a half for the rockets and the heads. , Yai 1.5 / 5.
