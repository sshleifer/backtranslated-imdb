The super sexy actress B has another role in the role of girlfriend Godfilas star Ray Leuta in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, she has only one line of dialogue, well, one word of dialogue in fact. She screams "Joe!" As Ray's character violates Pia Zadora's poor spray with a plastic garden hose. This movie is very bad although it becomes funny and sometimes funny. Men at Mystery Science Theater 3000 love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia suffers from a nervous breakdown and all the editing and cunning effects they are doing to try to show how bad Pia is. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood scriptwriter in this. Pia Zdora as a screenwriter? Yes correct. Pia hardly speaks, let alone writing! Pia is completely miscast and fully in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is Glory Annen, warm and fresh in her small part in the opinion of this cat! Rock on glory!
