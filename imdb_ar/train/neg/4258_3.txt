I would like to give this movie 5 instead of 3 if at least in time ... when I first saw it was what you can expect from a work that does not depend on the artistic abilities of the directors but ideally or better to say stupid customs to our government ) ... It is shameful, because Kazakfilm was filming beautiful films when she was not honored by the name of Shakan Aymanov, but she was already running by him. Movies such as "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after the death of Mr. Aymanov, the production of high-quality films fell almost dramatically in 10 years, and there were very few films produced. However, in the late 1980s, "Asa" was filmed, and it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the big country. One year later, Rashid Nogmanov filmed another film with the same actor / singer. , At that time was already the legend of Soviet / Russian rock music, - the movie "needle" (the needle or something) was completely new, and some have described that period as a resurrection or a wave of new Kazakh films. Unfortunately, for now, we do not have high-quality films, and our directors produce films on French and Japanese financial support, so the films are not intended for the public but for professional authors, some of them are priced at international film festivals for authors but few are commercial assets ... Then we went back to the "Bedouins". These films are usually unpopular due to wide aspects. The same effects were in the film "Sibirski Cyrilnik" written by Nikita Mikhalkov about Russian tsars, which was also shot with some foreign partners, and I think they were French or perhaps British. I did not like anyone, even in the Russian audience, became a major theme for comic artists and comedy shows such as "KVN". IMHO
