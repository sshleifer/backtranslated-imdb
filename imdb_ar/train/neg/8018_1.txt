Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should have produced a really good film, and the main actor was sensitive and talented enough to deal with the subject, but the scenario - if there was a script - is a mess. This film is less than a random slide show that does not go anywhere. I would say that it is not going fast, but it is actually the longest 81 minutes you will spend. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. As well as Poluk's Faroza (SP?), As his sometimes cruel but eventually loving and acceptable mother. Movie makers have a lot to answer, because that's a mess. It's a real shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but it's basically films that have never been produced. Skip this - it was not worth the $ 6 you paid for pay per view.
