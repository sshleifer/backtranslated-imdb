I saw this movie one day in a film school class, I never saw the movie Almodovar before, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a useless film with a couple of laughs mixed with two hours of intense boredom. High Heels are just a bunch of random scenes that may have worked in their own separate movies but together do not add up to any kind of meaningful all at all. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. After that, the next day, my film teacher spent the entire chapter period explaining all the hidden small details of the film, such as how the painting depicting typical flamenco dancers in the backdrop of the Queen of Dragons scene is a kind of comment on the lack of identity that Spain has developed as a state under fascist rule . Apparently, the full movie is full of smart visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Wonderful, but you know what? Still a bad film. Requires a good film action more than the depth and complexity - I still need to give a good reason for the audience to continue attention, something interesting enough viewer to take care of all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us quirky characters, but he keeps them in worldly positions mostly recycled from other films, and it seems that the modofar does not use them to excite any kind of points. What is the significance, for example, of the sudden revelation of Hitchcock's character that happens at the end of the film? Why is this even there? Just to our surprise? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene that has to do with broadcasting news. That's it, this is the only leisure moment. The rest of the film is just illogical cinematic signals and visual signals that exist only to show the intelligence of Pedro Almodovar. But no matter what my teacher says in the film, it takes more than a self-deception to make a good film.
