The horror film is really weak ... this if this is the right movie that I comment on. Nothing really terrible since the family adopts a small Shepard German. I had a German Shepherd and a really good dog. I did not get the idea of ​​getting one from this movie, but from the comedy "K-9". This is another story together. This film really does not have much horror at all because the ugliest scene is the ultimate and it looks really cheesy. Also, see a man putting his hand almost on the grass mower. That's about it. The father suspects something is happening, and his family seems rather strange, somewhere he discovers whether you carry the mirror to them while they sleep, you can tell if they have property. All in all horror film is really weak even according to TV standards ... TV movies that work pretty well because "The House Possessed" is very good and there is a haunted house movie about a woman and these alien creatures are good. This one is really pretty boring.
