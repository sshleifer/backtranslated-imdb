Her father, Jane Parker, whose father has long disappeared (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a highly inconsistent career) in Africa is studying something or other. She follows him (how?) And tells her stories of giant parents whose voice can be heard at night throughout the forest. Turns out to be the same Ape man (Miles O'Keefe, who has the best dialogue in the film), who saves her from the bad guys and falls in love with them, leaving them enough time in this stricken two-hour to break naked horny monkey appear in the middle of cheers. I'm usually open to divergent opinions about any film, but that's the only exception. This is the worst film ever. If you disagree, you do not see it. (Notes: The Newsday has been described as "intolerable," the best summary of one word I can think of.) The Maltine Film Guide explains that they had to think of a lower rating than BOMB.)
