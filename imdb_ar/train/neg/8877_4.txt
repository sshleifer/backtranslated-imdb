"Major Payne" is a film about a pioneer who makes life alive for his small group of Marines. This movie does not have much to offer, but it offers several fun moments to watch. Do not expect it to be an unforgettable film. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the fat boy was hilarious, and that's all I remember about the film except for the boys who want revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and maybe it's best to see it on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
