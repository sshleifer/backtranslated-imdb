Sergio Lyon spins in his grave ... if there is any film trampling on the life of a man who works this one. The only wolf character of the leading character is uninspiring and awkward, and it seems that the script was written by a monkey who received eighth grade education. Whatever idea this should have been the horse's skin. The only reason I spend time getting rid of waste is that there are 10 lines at a minimum. Sergio Leon's family must sue, not because of her crap, but because he is now devoid of crap by the 3000 MST. Shame. Disgust. At least, Gary Bossi is a crap that hurts no one but cocaine users and weapons experts ... This film is pure blasphemy.
