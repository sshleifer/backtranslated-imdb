I did not know anything about this film before I was convinced to see it by a friend who heard that it was "an endless epic battle scene from start to finish." It can not be further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateur-oriented, and horrific acts I've ever seen. I put it in first place with the movie which I consider the worst film ever ... Battlefield Earth. There is no story at all, it is hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this stunning opera opera soap would be taken seriously as a true historical fact. It also contains some of the worst dialogue I've heard of ... such a small gem ... The guy tells the girl "You smell like a moon." "What does the moon smell like?" My God! You must be kidding me! The scene in which the man was pulled out and mocked was a good laugh from the audience because it seemed ridiculously cheap, and the sound of the Forex for the man who had torn me up reminded me of someone making a bad noise. If this plays in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This film is so bad that I actually made the decision in about 45 minutes and I needed to catch up with sleep ... and did it. Sei.
