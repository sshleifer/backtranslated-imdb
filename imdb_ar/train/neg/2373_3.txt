Warning: Review contains moderate spoilers <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was able to watch the first five films in this franchise, and I was planning to conduct an overview of the Elm St. series. The whole. However, after only two years I find that I can not remember enough about them in order to do this? I think they could not leave a big impression. From what I remember, some sequences ?? Dream warriors in particular? They were not as bad as often, although the original was not classy. In general, predictability of the hypothesis (if people overcome sleep in their dreams) does not allow for narrative tension. But although I can not remember much of the first five films, I know that they never fell into the depths of Freddie's death. <br /> <br /> A reference to the extent of Freddy's illness can be judged in the public at this stage. The fact that the film has been promoted only when personal death. The fact that the conclusion of the film is not hidden, but in fact the full purpose of the existence of the film goes to explain how the project was vacant without value and joking. <br /> <br /> Taking a morally dubious idea of ​​child molestation as the attractive villain, Robert Englund's sudden interpretation of laughter flourishes. I always thought that Freddy's irony of adolescent victims was less targeted to the characters than the adolescent audience who could have seen the trip. "We know this is rubbish, but you pay for it, who laughs?" I am sure that the victims of child abuse will be frustrated to see this insensitive perception of their plight. Was Freddie's appearance in films always very primitive? All he does here is some "haaaaaaaaaaaaaar" har ?? har ?? hars "and that's it. If this is a movie Elm St. The only one I saw, you will never know personal at all. Although the pre-death character in the flashback is played by Englund as an evil pantomime villain with a descent from the Atlantic (an exaggeration, misleading and not funny at all). Globally poor. See only how often Brecken Meyer compares the gestures of his hand and body language. Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, maintains his dignity. When Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper appear, you can see the movie almost drown in the swamp. The script, too, is very poor, almost to no avail. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, written by Freddy like Noel Coward "You f ** ked". When the map asks you, Carlos responds, "Well, the map says we 've been." Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or what about the scene in which Carlos was tortured by Freddy, So, Freddy is tormented by the threat of dropping a pin - a potentially fatal voice, since all the voices are magnified.Oddly enough, the fact that Carlos screams at the top of his voice for him not to drop him seems to have no effect. "Freddie mocks, hoping some better lines will come in. It should also be noted that dreaming sleep does not happen right away, so exposure to Despite the fact that part of the narration contains a human computer game, the final three-dimensional logic of the plot is not at the forefront of the requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers who head the team this time are the most Really disgusting, undesirable collection in the whole chain.Tricie (Leslie Dean) is the only one who gets a greeting to Freddie "Close f ** k, man" and kick in the scallops. Freddie is dead. do not laugh. no fear. no interest. Not fun. <br /> <br />
