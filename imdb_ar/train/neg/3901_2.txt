Nice script. Although the casting process is not configurable at all. Fashion does not look like some of the Highbury community. By comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsell, I can only say that Ms. Beckinsell speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow, although Ms. Paltrow's representation lies in the nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unpopular like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. Note: The viewer can not see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. Smith's relationship developed as in the movement's version, so one can not understand where all Emma's attempts were to make Elton-Smith's match (along with the picture).
