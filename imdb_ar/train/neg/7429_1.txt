Who am I? I am not joking. This is what you really say in the case of a video. <br /> <br /> Plot: Short version: A beautiful woman stands around smiling. This, for some reason, makes all men kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Look for Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... Ariel can not find ..." She stands behind you completely, you idiot. <br /> <br /> Much of what can be said about this appalling little space opera has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of bad actors who play mostly convicted ones who come after the first stop-selection of actors very quickly. Then they stopped working the same way. Each scene is broadcast approximately fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a straw pull to see which actors had the most time on the screen and a bigger paycheck. It seems that the strange virus / Hologram / VR witch / dysfunction is physically weak and does nothing. Why can not you stay in the computer instead of doing a "remote vampire" protein? (In fact, it was interesting if they were a vampire, or do more than just stand around looking at people, which is what you do at all ... that's enough to make all men kill each other.) <br /> <br /> This is not really a flick. There are more shots of the old Western track, the 1950 Easy Rider, the Noir nightclub scene, and even jogging on the beach in the fantasy land, none of which has any real depth or even meaning. Black and white night club scene, of course. I worked with the "Wizard of Oz". Not working well, here. This is probably a good thing, as the few shots they show from space are frustratingly silly. You may cry during those moments, especially when you see that "space ship", which is about three inches long. <br /> <br /> There is nothing tangible for any of the characters, not because they are convicted or have no personality, but because they are in desperate need of acting classes, except for Billy De Williams who seems really depressed and puzzled, perhaps by being in this Action ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, will cause some very "noisy" silence, especially when the nerd casts his attempt on the comic lines (including The line of kissing the meteorite ... Did you hear that right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The girls are exposed to the original virtual reality of "killing", which means nothing, since they They are not even real. Well, other "characters" are not, but this is next to the subject. Haha. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that the scene of the video is a kind of strange horror that sounds like a weirdo (the green filter is added above it to give him more details). ..uh ... green shape), which is actually robot after killing him, and in the end has nothing to do with anything else on the road. <br /> <br /> Another strange deal I noticed. Whenever an explosion occurs (at least in a cheap DVD), everything becomes highly divided. I do not mean a small pixel unit, I mean huge blocks of about 1/16 screen size. Wonderful.
