Scottie (Grant Cramer, who will join the film in the great film "Killer Klowns from Outer Space") agrees to help three middle-aged men learn how to "dialogue" the ladies in this bad comedy "The Eighties." Not as bad as the language of the 1980s, which means well. Bad as in bad. With no favorite characters, including, but not limited to, a girl of the most horrible characters since the "Friday 13th 2nd" girl leads the men then fade with a hush when they want to touch her, fat fleshy symbol, because after all that will be a comedy Sex '80' without fat slob? Well this one has two. This film is the bottom of the sex comedy barrel in the eighties. Then complementing and thus deepening the barrel of ideals. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Too many to be unreliable, so you see a child who looks strange imagines with the breast at this stage, think of "Bachlor Concert" But not as funny and very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
