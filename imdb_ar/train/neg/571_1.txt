I hired this just because I loved the first movie. However, it is called John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to let you hire them. He is in fact an executive producer and has nothing to do with making this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> A tragic story and terrible special effects and John Bon Jovi as one of the least convincing vampires all the time. It's not bad comically. <br /> <br /> It's a boring film that is not homogeneous with terrible texts and behaves badly. They are just low-budget packages. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the bubonic plague.
