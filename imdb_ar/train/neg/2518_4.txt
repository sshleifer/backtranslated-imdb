Think of a darker version of a children's show like Power Rangers and you've had this movie since 1990, "Robot Jox". A film in which giant robots fight, two men enter the arena and win everyone who comes out of their country. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions than the ones that appear from the programs listed mainly because they are less colorful, and although this movie is not good, it is not good to watch it. There are also two robot battles in this one, one ends badly and the final. There is part of the ground piece twist during the detection of the traitor, but in the end, you will not be colluded with you at any time after the end of the image. The battles themselves look like giant games, but they are still fairly fun to watch. This film will also produce two other films with similar drawing devices such as giant robots and heroines. So it's worth checking once, but probably not more than that.
