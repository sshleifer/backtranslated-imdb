This is not an awesome comedy, but it's very boring. Barely laughing, and wasting the value of its luxury production. There is a painful moment approaching the end, when Fu Manchu introduces a dose of his exuberance to his "opponent" and tells him "I was my opponent worthy; now we can start again." However, this scene, along with the delightful Burt Kwouk veil at first, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
