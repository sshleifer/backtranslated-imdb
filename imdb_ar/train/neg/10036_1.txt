At some point I failed to understand what directors were thinking when making a film ... I was shocked after watching Welcome (2007) and I thought they would not do it again. But after a lot of amazing promotions, Tashan finally ended up having a heart attack. <br /> <br /> These three amazing songs in the promotion - Del Hara, Chalia and Tashan Min ..... and what do you get in the film? A zero story, a predictable plot, a lot of stunts for Akshay Kumar, nothing interesting apart from watching Karenna after losing her big weight ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music - Another Great Disaster ... In the music album they spent some time giving pathetic little dialogues of those four who did not think of giving the background song to the viewer when Akshay Kumar did the stunts ...! This song is beautiful, similar to Tashan Min and is not dealt with in the music album !!! :-( If you are planning to watch this movie, I can watch it and watch it to listen to a background song that turns into something like ... "Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ..." <br /> <br /> Very disappointed even with the way Which Bhayagi made by trying to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Stay away, man, I need to vomit!
