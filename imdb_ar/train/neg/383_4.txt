The plot line for No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is of great importance. But throughout watching this movie, we were saying out loud, "These filmmakers are having trouble finding good sites, good lighting, make-up and good hair ... Why is the sound so bad?" The sound throughout the film was echoed and distorted and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is some good representation in this film, and I think Jim Talman is a really good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, was worth doing as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I can not repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to a good voice. . The sound is part of the film as far as the picture is, and deserves to be done correctly. I could have won 6.
