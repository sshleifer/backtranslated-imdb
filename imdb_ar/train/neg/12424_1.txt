If you want to laugh like crazy, hire Cage. Cage revolves around war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are the best friends. When Billy is filmed in Vietnam, he is unable to defend himself, so Scott takes it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a film that includes more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love "wrestling" and Scott tells Billy that "it's still painful from last night," among other things. <br /> <br /> Fantastic phrases like "Shut the sh! t up" and "Ping Pang Pong, Cut sh! t" will keep you laughing for hours. Native Americans who are supposed to play with Mexican gang members are also in the lead. As they say, it's "party time right now." Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. " I could go on forever, but just watched this movie and I laugh at $ $$. It was very enjoyable, and I went out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
