It is supposed to be based on the life of Harvey Domino model turned into a rewarding hunter. I would say 95% is fabricated. I always stay open when it comes to films, but this film lost its chances when it became clear that he had a novel throughout the film, something I can not stand on, and most importantly, that the heroine of the story is so hateful and imagines that she is arrogant! The chapter just wanted to end with a shot at the head. It is very incoherent, very glamorous and too boring. It offers a story of folly, and I really think that big directors need to produce films based on their imagination or their writer's imagination, not something that depends on the life of the ignorant Snoopie. .
