After a series of power outages at the island's remote zoo, the tigers have genetic genetic designs on the island's people who lose their power. Man, the science fiction channel made some bad "original" movies, but I think this is probably the worst film yet! The "Jurassic Park" group, written and poorly-directed, presents all the usual clich√©s (mad scientists who believe that people killed by monsters are "expendable losses", characters walking in long dark corridors on their own, and brainwashed adolescent characters working only in the film) Terrible, etc.), not surprisingly, that there is no suspense at all. Awesome special effects - doll heads in the confidant of monster animals are bad enough, looks like solid plush dolls, but CGI ?? That make computer-generated dinosaurs in "walking with dinosaurs" look like life in comparison? Are just plain awful. There are some gaps, but most of them seem unconvincing. Oh, the death scene of the world in the end is really one of the worst things I have seen in years. I could not even laugh it was too bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, it's all bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, here's some interesting trivia for you? The film borrowed musical references from 2003 Alien Hunter, which was much better than this piece of nonsense.
