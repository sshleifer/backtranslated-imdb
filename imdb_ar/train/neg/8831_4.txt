After hearing a lot of people chanting about this film, I thought I would give it a chance. Apart from being incredibly slow, I do not mind as long as the wait is worth it, but that is not so. Many others have said there are many contradictions and much of this film does not seem right. The reaction of the four men turns from shock and horror when the body is found to complete indifference while hunting. Sure, if they were the men who were fishing happily, then they would report the body, saying they only discovered it after their fishing trip. Why on Earth would you hook the body to a tree and go fishing and tell everyone you found the body two days ago? It is very difficult to watch a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is very inconsistent. As for the rest of the city's population, you think that at least one of them may show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except the knickers .... What scenario leads to it? If she was raped then why do the clippers remain? If she was raped with clothes, why should she remove them after that? If you have not been raped, why take off all her clothes from the contestants ... and leave yourself evidence to get rid of them? I can not really think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal his clothes so you can fill the booth selling the batter! Well, it's viewable but just and just because, despite the weak writing, the acting is strong.
