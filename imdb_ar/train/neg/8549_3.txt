Well, what kind of hell of TRASH are you watching now? "The Mountain of the Sorcerer" must be one of Spain's most insidious and crazy exploits at the same time, and at the same time, it is also convincing. There is nothing logical at all here and I doubt there was any text to work with, but somehow I could not stop it.

Do you think this film revolves around children who are possessed by the forces of evil? No, because after this introduction, the girl is no longer mentioned evil simply. The man then bursts into the room with the most impressive drinker he will ever see, separated from his girlfriend in a rather indifferent way. When you ask him to spend his vacation with her, call the employer immediately and ask him what kind of tasks! Great step. The film finally begins now, while traveling to an isolated mountainous area to film some summits. If not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Sheppard) and pictures her naked! Throughout their journey, all kind of strange events occur ?? Are you sad Never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud music playing loud everywhere, someone stealing a pocket! Really, car-hunting magicians? He seems to have a mountain of silent magicians practicing voodoo on the tides. This is as close to describing the outline, but is there a good chance to be away?

Sometimes the "Witches' Mountain is very creepy, with nervous music and interesting cinematography, all supporting characters look strange, and the charming Beatty Sheppard plays a good hero." This is the kind of European horror film that could have been legendary, if someone He himself has bothered to write a structured script.
