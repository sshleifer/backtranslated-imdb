This film is not funny anyway, it tries to be funny because it is a lame jaw, so dry and boring that the film takes only two hours of torture. Throughout the film I was thinking of one thing, "When will this end". One thing you have to hand over to them is that they have very few funny moments, which is why I also gave it two stars in full. It is non-original and uses almost every old blonde joke in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. It is basically a film to reduce the blondes and recording the full repetition of the blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, this movie is a wicked humor that has worsened, not worth paying any viewing amount, is just so bad.
