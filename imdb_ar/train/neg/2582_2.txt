I just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I must say, this was a pile of trash. The first 3 American pies were Farhana, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. <br /> <br /> Since you discovered the title of the movie, Beta House, they are brothers, novices and girls, and the most original part of them all, falling in love. Of course, the man who makes his way with the chicks is Steffler, who, along with his comrades, is trying to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super fake. It's just really predictable and the plot is very weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets everything (something like that) to sum up: Terrible Representation + Boring Scenario + Misuse of American Pie Pie = Total Time-consuming! This film is unbearable. I give it two every ten, although most of them sucked there was a lot of nudity and beautiful girls, like two funny scenes :)
