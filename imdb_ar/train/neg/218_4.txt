*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story looks good and if you have read the novel, you probably expect a deep and intense film that can provide some insight into some interesting and unexplored human relationships. <br /> <br /> True enough, the text tries to do this, the director tries to do so, but the main staff fails miserably. The representation of Maria is so dry that he lacks any feeling at all, and seems to be her most comic moments. Sometimes look tense because of the camera. Her only scene is really near the end where she gets rid of her friend. <br /> <br /> It seems that Iwana is more nervous than Maria Bell and even worse, she does not look normal at all. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being clear, but she got it and her personality got some credibility. To make matters worse, we have no insight: where did they come from, how come they got involved in the lesbian relationship, and how did the relationship evolve? We only get some parts of her parents and their relationship seems to "exist": containing content and an end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only once a truly touching scene, the scene in which she relinquishes the personality of Maria Kiki. <br /> <br /> Theodore is the only person in this film (apart from the owner of the house, the wonderful acting there) who can prove some talent by proxy. He has his personality attitude and fits. He seems to stumble once or twice only (the scene at his parents' meal, trying to be clear when it was not necessary at all). <br /> <br /> I like the story, Theodore Cheryla is fine there acting the owner actually and Puya presents his two lines elegantly, but this does not save the film. Too bad, the entire preparation had enormous potential and Romanian cinema could use a film about it. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have greater credibility than the background does not feel (well, Maria's spoken breaks are a nice attempt in this direction) lesbian relationship Maria and Iwana. I am very sorry to spend money on a ticket, and I'd better see it from my comfortable room.
