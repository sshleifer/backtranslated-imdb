If this movie should be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". To sum up, this film is only 88 minutes from two unruly rural villains gripping the famous Dodge Charger 1968 throughout the city and in the country, chasing girls and evading law. <br /> <br /> I have been a fan of "Dukes" and what distorts the film is the characters outside the key. Excessive behavior in profanity, sexual references and drug abuse have made the common name for "dukes" in the trash. <br /> <br /> In addition to comparing it to the TV show, the acting was terrible. The only actor who has succeeded in that is the famous 1969 Dodge Charger General Lee. The others played a role in the character that distorted the film. <br /> <br /> Dukes was another victim of the tragedy of moving to Hollywood's 21st century television. Skip this movie and just buy the TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F
