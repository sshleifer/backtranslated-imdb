I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. Apart from a few blessings of saving, nothing to write about home. <br /> <br /> J-horror has flourished over the past sixty-six years, but the films themselves on more than one account were repetitive and carbon copies of past success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is very italic. The beginning is foreshadowing chilling scenes from a morgue where the dead girl's eyes are stitched together graphically, but soon open. However, after that, you can quickly get to this point. <br /> <br /> To be nice, I'll start with the things I love about "Gawi". On the positive side, the pictures are flashy and the film looks great in its kind. For those who love their horror movies, there are a few scenes of murder (not intended as puns). We also got a few sequence suspense / set pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few disadvantages too ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, my main complaints about this film, is that the plot skips and jumps back and forth in time With alarming intensity. Usually this is not a problem for me, but here, where the students seem quite alike no matter how old they are, I was confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> I think the shows are fine (a) it's hard to tell if you do not know the language), but you seem to be a bit harsh. For the horror film, I do not think it was scary enough. For a while I was really bored. <br /> <br /> As a Jialo fan, I was expecting a lot of "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was very disappointed.
