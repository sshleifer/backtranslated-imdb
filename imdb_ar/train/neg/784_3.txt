Despite reviews and positive performances at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films, where a teenage girl from the immigrant family needs to overcome many of the most common personal characters of her time, as well as to combat the pressures of ethnic traditions in her family. She does this by choosing a type of sport, and with the help of a local boy, this falls in love with her for some reason, she faces her problems and wins them. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight, she's boxing, in her lap like Beckham she's football, now she's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is a lesser product than the two, it was embarrassing to watch. Simra Turan, the "actress" who plays as a teenager, may do a lot of things, but the only thing she can not do is act. Her presence on the screen is marked by anemia and gagging, and dramatic situations in which she tries to show some of the feelings, horrific, and her body and language in the face of an amateur actress, with bad instructions from the director. The rest of the crew is a bit better, but they can not just keep this smiling movie with stereotyped characters and a shallow plot. Along with a few relatively good moments, this film does not contain anything new or interesting. <br /> <br /> Even kung fu fighting is no reason to watch this, it is very boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was fundamental and lacked inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes were just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu sites, not fighting in fact. Not to mention the irony that appears to them when a small and slender little girl fights the big boys and muscles, and knocks them off their feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie is ever noticed is that it is European. It's very easy to publish this film - Denmark's first martial arts film, but do not be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about a stupid teenage girl and her problems, which, by the way, are not really convincing. <br /> <br /> A bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.
