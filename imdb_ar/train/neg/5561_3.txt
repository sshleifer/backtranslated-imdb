I saw this film under the title "Constrained". In general, I enjoyed Dolph movies, so I tried it. It was not worth it. I've read some of the previous comments about the viewers stimulus box. Do not be fooled. This is a bad film at best. Representation does not exist. The plot, what a few one, is very predictable. It seems that the film in the places was cut together. This one just stinks plain place up. Not even worth the cheap night rental price. As a Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him in motion. By the end of the film, still waiting. It is best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost anything else.
