What has become of the earth from our dear Ramo? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Compagnie? I refuse to believe it. If AAG is Ramo's most ambitious project, it has clearly jumped from the top of the cliff by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to drop like bricks. I was going to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I could not get my car out of the parking lot before the others left too. Another, nothing made me sit beyond the interval. <br /> <br /> This film is not close to Sholay. So they do not come near it a mile away. I think Ramo certainly loves the godfather more than Cholay, because Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read the Ramo interview two days ago, where the interviewer said that Ramo did not sleep for more than 4 hours a day, and that was also not an extension. I agree with this quite now, since his lack of sleep has affected the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not seem scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and backgrounds I had seen earlier. Nisha Kothari's favorite Ramo did a great job at Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact nothing if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this film and found a place in history. The new Guy, who plays Jay, seems to have this explosive appearance, but he has never run Jay's role. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is so great that I can not manage it right now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the film that I would watch the original Sholay movie again just to see that it was still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Horrible movie. The media and critics will cook Ramo Goose. And just to remind all readers again, I am one of the biggest fans of Pramo, so I can not avoid it for this work.
