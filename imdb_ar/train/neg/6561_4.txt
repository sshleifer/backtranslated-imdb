The opening sequence is supposed to show the arrival of the Legion to Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops are accumulating off the train - wearing the uniform of the French army, including the Legion, to the war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the dust from the war you are about to see will be Turkey. (The French army realized by 1915 that going to war was wearing red trousers and dark blue coats that were not working.) The troops of the French capital were placed on the Blue Horizon and colonial forces were put in the khaki. At least the new edition got the outfit more or less right. It is really very bad when board members make these mistakes when they go to make every effort to correct other things.
