"Against All Hope" is a very bad film, sometimes very painful. This is Michael Madsen's first film, which shows that he is not good at it. Some people may find a funny story; an alcoholic knows that his family is disintegrating, so he preaches the preacher as a last resort to help. After informing the preacher of his story, Jesus Christ accepts in his heart. <br /> <br /> I've found many religious scenes, like when Cecile Moi (Madsen) goes to church but walks away from realism. I also liked how Cecil knew that his life was breaking up and trying to get help, but I knew that only God could help him. In the end, he realizes with the help of God that he can pass through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good at all. The representation is bad, the script may use some work, and it looks worse than the home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will automatically be able to stop your addiction or heal your broken family. Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track. In general, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate the extent to which this film is represented in Christianity. If you are not, you may find yourself invited to learn more about faith.
