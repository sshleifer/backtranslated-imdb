I saw this film literally after finishing the book, and perhaps this was a neutral idea or a very stupid idea. I think it was the last. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small details, but it is important. One of the first things I observed, during his daily life at Winston's work, his conversations, eating at the cafeteria, etc., was that he felt free to appear unhappy and showed a peek at people without tremendous fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to show even a hint of his real emotions on his face at any moment. This also appears in the scenes in the streets of the proletariat. In Winston's book I knew that this was a great risk of touring there and was skeptical and fearful on every trip. While in the film, do so without fear, so that you lose the important sense of intense control and risk directly away from the racket. <br /> <br /> Some minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his memoirs in the wall, yes a very simple change, but he asks the question, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing the director could do through a book, and this turns into characters. <br /> <br /> However, the big mistakes were very worrying. First of all, one of the important parts of this book is that Big Brother is a government based on a clever yet rude philosophy. In the film, skip this and go straight to make you think the government is run by Hitler using technology. This is true, to a certain extent, when it is directed by typing it, but if this is all you get from Big Brother, you have really missed the book's goal. The dreadful thing about Big Brother is that, somehow, he has some points behind his philosophy. When O'Brien chooses Winston's mind in the Department of Love, he listens to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is actually what is more creepy and interesting. Finally, when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the scary thing is that you are not sure whether it was the victim and the torture that caused it, or the actual power behind philosophy. I do not say in any way that the philosophy of the older brother has points of liking to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how can anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was terrible, nothing to do with it at all. <br /> <br /> Where was O'Brien before he made a speech with Winston? One of the things that carried the book was Winston's ideas about O'Brien before he called him. In the film, they jump only the gun. <br /> <br /> But this sums up why this movie is a terrible adaptation: it's impossible not to jump on the gun and turn the characters in less than two hours. How can anyone believe that this movie was a spectacle if it was less than two hours? At least, the film requires 3 hours to be able to capture some mood and important relationships. Anything less is meaningless. <br /> <br /> If you love the book, and I really mean it, you will not agree with this movie, chances are, you already know you will not do it. Since the book can not be solved, this film proves the impossibility of making it fit in a small reel of film. <br /> <br /> Two out of ten
