Vampires vs. Zombies was not the original title. It has actually been ... <br /> <br /> Sub-vampire bad lesbian and two zombies get hit by cars: special guest appearances by Bob the gypsy lesbian witch and her dog, a random woman with special powers and a Catholic school girl skirt Short Chorus Chorus. <br /> <br /> Also in the box: Warning: No Plot - Only the writer and director will understand the ending, or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite my grandfather, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even enjoy lesbians. Combine this film between the three with a mysterious and confusing plot (or nonexistent), a terrible dialogue (I mean READY BAD), random objects and people who have nothing to do with anything (or do ... I did not know what the world was going on). Oh, and I can not forget the green oatmeal "Zombies" in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they could not even cover the hands of Zombies in oatmeal and paint). Anyway, the result was a BAD film unambiguously, even if you could call it. <br /> <br /> Was the end supposed to be illogical? Was the vampire really a nurse and the other girl really mentally ill? Where were the vampires versus. zombies? Hell, where were the vampires at all ... you really can not call any of the vampire girls. whatever. <br /> <br /> This movie is never rented or purchased. If you are really curious ... well, I will understand. Seriously, even BAD film lovers will not be able to stand this one. The number 1 should be at the bottom of 100.
