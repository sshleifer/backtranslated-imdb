Well, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong productions, one in New York with the original actors, the other in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, You're Rock!). Compared to any of this film is almost inaccessible. I've been ploding through the DVD in the past evenings and I'm still not finished. Way a lot of strange dialogue, waaay a lot of added scenes and people. Yes, the four main presentations are very good, esp. Ms. Streep. But comparing theater with cinema is certainly an example of "the least is more". The play's thickness was to satisfy the need of filmgoers to diversify landscapes and privacy a bad choice. Please, please, please go to find the production stage somewhere near you.
