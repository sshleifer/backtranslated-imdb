It was not good. The characters were backward and the only personality was from my memory of the previous film which contradicted the "new" characters (or lack thereof). I thought seriously that the opening scene was a nightmare for Ariel because of the absurdity. He was serious. He reminded me only of all the annoying characters on the Disney Channel. Everyone is too active and the story moves from work to embarrassing scenes without any real contact. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the terrible songs - not attractive is not amazing. Originally, the sound of Ariel's voice was amazing and strong and all the songs attractive and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this film were not at least creative; it seemed as if they were talking in a very loud, disappointing voice, disappointing. I do not have this desire to sing where you usually get it from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It seems like nobody wanted to do this, so they barely made an effort. . . This film will need a new story, new songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without bothering "Look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying!" The mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
