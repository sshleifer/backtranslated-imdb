Wonderful. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this movie really takes the cake. It's the worst film I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a US war veteran in the war in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to finish watching this funny film, not because it brought memories back - but because there was never any attempt at "authenticity" Anywhere in the film. Not as small as a little scrape. It looked like it was written by an 8 year old boy who got all the concepts of war (and soldier behavior) directly from comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which was supposed to be an idea, but even this can not fully explain the horrendous production values ​​of this piece of litter filled with cliché. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but it will take forever. From the old shoulder patches of the unit that have not been seen or worn since World War II, personal name tags, such as "ColCollins" (which are worn by the character "Colonel Collins"), have already been spelled using a mirrored image, the "N" (Not the American alphabet) The list goes on and on. Uniforms, equipment, and plot, and in particular the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was filled with absurd flaws, inaccuracies and completely unconscious clichés. <br /> <br /> Neither the characters were the least credible It was all childishly funny, to the extreme It was supposed to appeal to boys before the age of majority, and I have no doubt that they will even find this film completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has absolutely no value at all. I strongly advise anyone reading this to pass through to this garbage.It's really not worth wasting one moment of your time to.
