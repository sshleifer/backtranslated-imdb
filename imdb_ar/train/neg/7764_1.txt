What is that ? Sex comedy low budget? In any case it perfectly describes people in Spain. They can come up with a better idea, I mean, they've been doing this kind of film since the sixties ... and people who love them! This is not a teen comedy or a family comedy (you can not let your 12-year-old baby watch kissing two young men in bed and never want to go to Spain). This should be classified as "R", because it seems that people over the age of 35 are laughing at watching them: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is an important part of the film). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is horrifying in films (except for Kosturica), adhering to the performance of dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
