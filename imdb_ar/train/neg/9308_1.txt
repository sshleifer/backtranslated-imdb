This was definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life, and I've seen some very bad films. I did not like how this film was filmed. All the actors are unknown, and it seems that a group of friends have met and decided to shoot their own film. But it is very shocking. I have never seen a worse film. The story is very fake, and I found it took a long time to reach the end of the film. There was no plot, it seemed as if it had not been planned before the shooting began. The story is very strange. I did not like how slow it was to get to the point of the movie. There was no point in filming this film. If you're thinking about watching this movie, no. You just waste your time.
