Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining the meaning of being an army. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been lost to bring Japanese culture closer to the wider Western audience and help demystify the country of the world of Zen, Samurai, the world of Gisha Kyoto. Some of the most touching moments in the film are when Americans are displayed in Japanese surroundings. The dances of the army were not real. There was a lot of Chinese music use. Simple but basic: the proper use of incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. Sakura's scenes were almost scandalous! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were completely disguised as Japanese people.
