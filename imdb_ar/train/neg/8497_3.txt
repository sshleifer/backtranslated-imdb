My title must be sufficient. <br /> <br /> It is puzzling that a very rich culture of literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Belzac, Mobassant) will break through like the "new opaque" motion. Until the twentieth century, France had great traditions of artistic clarity and intelligent philosophy. But the moment you hand them a movie camera, they start to work like WOOOHOOO LOOK, how can I be a stranger! Plot? Theme? F! Let's take a look at a tour of amusement park amusement park at least this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the appearance of people's heads.Oh-no-no, Coyle artist). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of optical clarity. But also the security camera in a quick hit. Can not be distinguished. <br /> <br /> Haha, quite as an aspect of all the obsessed school of film dweeby: I bet that the vein protrudes next to your neck now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my evaluation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you'll hate it. People who love this movie probably never read any books other than Jack Kerouac's statues or perhaps the Hitchcock Guide to the Galaxy. Or maybe they read the lyrics of The Doors, and they think they're moving deeply. Everything that floats a yer boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) hints at Balzac, one of the best and most meaningful writers who ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you're not near the pitch. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a syringe infected with AIDS. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person you think about, keep going. Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Pryson (PICKPOCKET), Japanese Master Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're stupid, Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And to push the house back in your neck. You look like cabbage.
