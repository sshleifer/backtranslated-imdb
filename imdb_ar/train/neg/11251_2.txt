Maybe Sky Captain is the best horror film I've seen in a long time. Spread with amazing CG and special effects, studded with the actors A-List (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi infinitely loved) and a race alongside the Indiana Jones-Esquire story of exaggeration but the movie to watch. <br /> <br /> "It should be" is the main term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays the role of Sky Captain in a broken tone and a lot of ideas - smirks, melts the hearts of smirks, but you can not do anything from nothing, even the pulsating renditions and the beautiful childish appearance can not save the dialogue Stone film. (If Giovanni Ribesi slapped his back and said, "Good boy, Dix", for once only, I might have been charging all over the man in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins, is no less than a nerve grind. Her nasal intonation and non-satirical comments are dated in the first ten minutes of the film. Perhaps she made a great effort to play the role of the comic book heroine, who knows? I was expecting more of them. An example of how to play a similar character (and play well) in the late nineties of the last century "The Phantom", starring Christy Swanson and Billy Zani. Rent a movie and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Both Giovanni Ribesi and Angelina Jolie were the two pillars of the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot at that point, I'll admit it.) In a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tiring material and perform a more agile performance than their two-dimensional dry mates. <br /> <br /> The plot and the steady progress of the story were old and boring, and it is basically just a monotonous mix of every good scene of Action in the last thirty years. Fast pace in the first half of the film, snail speed per second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the final result of the film, but to see who is the main villain also. The pairing is somewhat cliche, as it seems that Polly Perkins and Captain Sekane seem to unite after several years of separation from a bitter love story, and their story is not as charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally reconcile with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, no one is surprised, and no one really cares either. <br /> <br /> The director's props for Leigh's estimation are enough to wear a tight vinyl and the dark brown tones that were all-time coloring. But Sky Captain, although he has all the essential elements of being a great movie, is still flat on his face. Not worth even $ 2.75 paid to enter the theater.
