I wanted to love this film, but many elements destroyed it for me. The use of a fisheye lens all the time and intermittent editing did not give me the feeling that I was in the world of meth, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. It seems that the film never went anywhere and acting was really a great example of over-representation. I like movies that give us a glimpse of the abnormal underworld, but this film could not decide whether a horror film or a serious comment was worse than the horrors of addiction.
