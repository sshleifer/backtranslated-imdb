Minimum script, personal development minimum, minimum fixed camera. Maximum extended scenes, maximum headaches caused by continuous zoom, and maximum number of characters roaming the forest do nothing. Until the screen twinkle at 12:01 pm, you can progress quickly and not miss anything, as there are three fishermen who know nothing about doing anything. To be fair, the film has some fun music, so maybe the music video is the right way. Unfortunately, it was not, and what should have been short for twenty minutes extends beyond belief. Forget about the "trigger man", I know I'm trying it. - Merck
