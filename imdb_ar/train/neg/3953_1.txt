I can not believe that this movie was allowed. These people must get out of the drugs and overcome them with sharp objects. They must be tortured. This movie is abomination. It is only footage from the first film. Everything that is original is terrible and makes no sense at all. It's like a kind of hallucinogenic drug. Like, what is with putting on naked mirror therapy. Also, this stranger did not bother to watch the first film, because they continued to contact Suzanna Lov Natalie, when he was Lacy. I felt like screaming at the screen, "It's Lacy, it's Lacy !!!!" I give it 50 out of 10. My God !!!!
