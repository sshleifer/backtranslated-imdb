This is a really stupid film in this kind of eighties: Action Comedy. Similar to the peak hour concept but completely lacks movement, laughter and chemistry among the main characters in this film. Let me know that I enjoy Jay Leno as hostess and talk show talker, but he can not act. It's terrible when he tries to act - barely able to keep that brand smiling on his face while telling him militants unilaterally, by the way, is not very funny. And seeing him running (even at that time) is not a nice sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a good political impression on the Japanese. Do not even understand me in the story. I give it 2 out of 10.
