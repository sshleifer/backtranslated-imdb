I did not think it was possible, but I found a film worse than "body melting". This movie is really really bad! Worse still, his other Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Shot in a VHS-like format, and with the horrific rock music of the 1980s, continues to get worse and worse, which is unbelievable to see how bad Remembered a hanging skin upside down in white tomato sauce sprinkle anyone?) <br /> <br /> Why do their dialects change? From the bad New York Circuit, to prissy English, then pure Aussie! This happens for the entire staff! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won some film festivals on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). This must be a lie because no one in his right mind will nominate this for anything (maybe golden berries but I think it's very bad for that too). <br /> <br /> Come on, guys! This movie should be number 1 at the bottom 100 !!! Should be ten times as bad as those that already exist. <br /> <br /> Well done to the makers of "movies" in this trash, to prove a reason not to see movies ..... 0/10
