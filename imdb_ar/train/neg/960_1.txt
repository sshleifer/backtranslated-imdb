Oh my God. I was very disappointed because this film was just a piece of Ringo in Japan. Well, I think the US made its version of it too, but at least it was an explicit new edition. Very sad. I enjoy watching Filipino films very much and I know that some wonderful things can come from a small country, so I can not believe that this has happened. Claudine and Chris of the big names there, were surprised that they would belong to plagiarism. To any of the aspiring filmmakers in the Philippines: You do not have to go down to this point to make money. There are many movie aficionados watching and enjoying the movies that the Filipinos take out!
