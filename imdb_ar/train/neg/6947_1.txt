Without a doubt one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women payments to steal banks that we are supposed to sympathize with one way or another. It is difficult to sympathize with the characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police are for us, they know who we are, what do we do? Let's steal another bank then we're here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype, and it is easy to know who will end up dead.
