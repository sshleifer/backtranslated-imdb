Harold Pinter rewrites the classic Anthony Shafer play about a man going to visit his lover's husband and get everything on the other side. The original film starring Lawrence Olivier and Michael Kane. Caine plays the role of Olivier in this release and is associated with Jude Law. The film is directed by Kenneth Branough. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Both Kane and the Law is gangs in their respective roles. I really love chemistry and clash personalities. It's great and enough to watch when the direction of the script goes. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is fragile, sharp and often very smart. I understand why he chose to rewrite the play (which is being updated to take advantage of surveillance cameras and the like). The problem is that how to move the script to the characters is horrible. Michale Caine walks through the law in his strange modern house with sliding doors and slabs without a really good reason. Talks occur repeatedly in different locations. I know that Pinter did it in his plays, but in this case it becomes boring. Why do we need the couple to retreat over and over again with the fact that Lu is sleeping with Ken's wife? It would be fine if the law said at some point enough we did this, but it does not act as if every time is the first time. The script also does not motivate Kin by exploiting the law well. First of all, he is blindly angry, so he has no chance to move around and frighten us (do not mind the delay in revealing the game that makes you wonder why he is upset). In the original, we never suspected what happened. We are here, and while it gives an advantage, it feels somehow false because it is very clear, we are forced to wonder why Milo would not see it being prepared. There are some other cases, but saying that more will give a lot. <br /> <br /> By thinking about the film retrospectively, I think it's a film about lost opportunities and mistakes. The opportunities that have been wasted are the chance to get the best fireworks between Caine and Law. Mistakes in that choice of Garish setting and individual transitions in the plot takes away from creating stress and excitement believing. Instead, we get some smart dialogues and great shows in a film that are not allowed to be real. <br /> <br /> Despite some great offers and smart dialogue, they are only 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just does not work
