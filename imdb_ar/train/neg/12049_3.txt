"To Die For" - a big man in a shirt and without some laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Archley (Simon), who is easy on the eyes, but does not laugh and little sex. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, claim that they have been together for several years, but there is no personality exciting enough to take care of, so it's hard to imagine they care about each other. It seems that the error lies in the script, not the performance; both actors do their best to give it. <br /> <br /> The end was happy and unaffected (well, not quite affected; I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a film about gay and lesbian relationships, "Parting Glances" is much better.
