What a joke. I watch it on Channel 1 and I think watching dry paint is more fun. What happened to Caspar van den which made him tight in this nightmare. Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's very terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of suspense, but it's more comedy. If you want to see terrible representation and funny writing of texts and sub-plot, check out this movie. If you are Van Dien, you will not only ask 10% of my agent, but shot the bastard in the process. What a Turkey. Not fitting to be on 3K MST !! It will be a good film to cure insomnia. I particularly like the part where Van Dien is thrown into the sea and then returned after a few minutes! I can only understand that this was written by non-union writers who benefit from the writer's strike. What a terrible movie !!!
