I will admit I did not give this film a big chance. I decided early on that this was not my film type. <br /> <br /> For the most part, he has an excellent look in terms of cinematography. The scenes of Manhattan in the early 1970s look very good, as well as the leading actress. It is very crisp white and black, which may make the film feel non-renewable. However, some of the other techniques used by directors are a shoot game that looks to hell. The detailed editing is the late VERY 60, somewhere between Surrealism and the New Wave. The story also feels that it came from a very specific time, somewhere between idealism, free love and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film follows a little girl all over the city looking for a man who had an anonymous phone having sex with. While meeting other curious characters, revealing the quirks she reveals. The film seems to be an extraordinary comedy, but it adds a wonderful feeling. I expect that if you like Andy Warhol, you'll be very excited to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some of the problems I encountered: Near the end of the film, a character tells a wandering story that lasts more than twelve minutes? - Wild to sit through. Also, there is a very clear animation sequence where I found the totals and events as the climax of the film. I laughed loudly four or five times and loved the end (minus flat disgusting animations). When the movie turned color to the phone booth sequence at night, I liked the way it looked the best. It ended up being one of those experiences that I felt I could really love if it was a bit different. But that's what the directors have given us. It is mysterious, artistic, and a left way of dial-up, but none of these reasons to recommend it on its own. I did not find it as unique or as creative as coercion.
