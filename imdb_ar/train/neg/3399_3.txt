A girl's birthday does not know what she wants to be - is she a comedy, is she a drama ... she just does not know. What can be a very funny or influential film ends up in a land that is haram. The hypothesis is original enough to make sure there is a text full of interesting scenarios but hardly any and ends up. This is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very strong all the time but they do not get a chance to shine. Very disappointing.
