But I got it. To me, it seemed that even the author of the book preferred Caroline. I felt very sorry for Louise's character, and she was constantly comparing to Esau who was evil, I felt that the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Really, though, the film was bad. I will really see it only if you are ready for great disappointment.
