Another of many of the nearly forgotten films that were overshadowed by the Poverty Row in the 1930s, he re-animated it with the magic of DVD. <br /> <br /> World Championships World Player Lionel Atwell (often a supporting actor in many Frankenstein films) is the twins involved in the murder racket. One of the victims (stockbrokers involved in a fraud) is killed and witnesses are questioned on time, while the other is deaf and proven to be "innocent" because he could not speak to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it collapses if it is congenital deafness, are not they both deaf? Oh, okay. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a very good job here, as it is fake with deafness and mute. Unfortunately, no one else can really act!
