I do not know what the fuss is about this ... It's a really bad movie ... Nothing has happened to me, the only landing scene is where everyone meets together at the concert, there's a beautiful song playing, beat the beautiful tones and movie clips that make you move .. This was the best part of the film. Otherwise, this film lacks everything to absorb the scenes in the film "There is no story." There is nothing to think, as some people say, there is no coherence between different stories ... By Anderson "Magnolia" which was wonderful, but it failed blatantly ... Well, it's light and easy to watch, but these videos also. You might first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I have ever seen
