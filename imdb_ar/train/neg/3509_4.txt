Somewhere inside this movie, there is a half-hour episode of the Twilight Zone trying to come out. While the Cube was tight and well-manufactured and scary for elegance and attractive, I'm afraid that Cypher is a swollen and boring rework of many well-worn themes that do not add much, especially if you've seen almost anything else a decent science fiction movie has been shown. Halfway by. <br /> <br /> Cypher can scroll all the time in 95 minutes to the inefficient end. None of the characters stand out from each other. For the 2002 film, the technology is really cheesy. It's hard to connect this tired and uninspiring movie to Cube. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not a good film. <br /> <br /> When you see the grass grow and droop from boredom and your insects are full of sticks, then watch this movie by all means, but other activities will probably prove more stimulating.
