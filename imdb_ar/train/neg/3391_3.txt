I wonder who, how, and most importantly, the reason for the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most unique sense of access to Broadway in many years? It's an Oscar-winning director. Yes, Gandhi has won you a moron! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award-winning actor, do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. really? "What a beautiful war" Have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is disappointing, clear and simple. There is no ounce of living energy saved from the harshness of procedures. Each character danced beautifully she was charming but dropping it was a play. I did not feel anything. But when I saw her on the stage I felt everything. The film was supposed to have been filmed by the stars, the unknown, and the newcomers, but the stars with stunning faces that are unforgettable, even the most mysterious in the group. Great actors that can dance beautifully. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True, I forgot that I am completely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical.
