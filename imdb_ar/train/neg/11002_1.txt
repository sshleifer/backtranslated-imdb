Hawks like the most offensive film ever, guaranteed to offend everyone - guess what? I succeeded, I felt insulted because we bombed the money to rent this. I and two friends felt bored and decided to find out if all this bull about the movie we saw on television was true. The Central Comedy curse and all the other networks that paid this trash us! It was the worst movie I've ever seen since Hole Man. I generally avoid those crappy, but sucked this one up. We have overcome the prick we propose to hire, and his film selection privileges have been canceled. There is nothing remotely funny about this film ... even the scene of "The Adventures of Dickman" was a student at best. Probably thought the production value was crap for an important reason ... no ... I just sucked. Never watch this! For whatever reason. Even with the abundant amounts of illegal material this film would be funny. That says a lot. Please, in order to love all that is sacred, if you are proud of your safety - you never see this movie. They are many things that are stupid, futile and worthless. But the main thing that was aimed at: funny offensive - failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
