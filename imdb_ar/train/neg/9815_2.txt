This film begins to present an original idea in some way but it became a great disappointment later. What is the deal to get an original start if the rest of the film has done little to avoid a cliched plot? The film itself is incredibly incredible. I want to know exactly how someone gets into the clinic, gets a nurse's clothes, kills a doctor, gets a patient out of bed, puts him in his pick-up truck and leaves her? I think no one can answer this question, so they jumped into the other scene hiding these little details. The offers are just bad. The villain is just a "crazy crazy opponent", no depth, completely linear character. After 20 minutes of the film, most of the scenes could not be believed, and they seemed to put it there for only 90 minutes because they did not need anything. A doctor who sees a woman clearly under a strong medicine, is she deprived of her examination, expelled from the home and simply left quiet? The end scene made me rush to laugh, Mickey Mouse is the only one that can make him more of a reality. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first time to suppose 10 minutes from the movie.
