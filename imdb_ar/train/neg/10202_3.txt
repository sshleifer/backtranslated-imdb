Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect to be dedicated to television but it is not. Given the only representative of any observation is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving toward bigger and better things), it is not surprising that this film quickly vanishes from memory to replace it with more important things. Like ... remember to lock your front door when you go out. Or wear clothes when you come out of the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Kacy Mayweather, a cop with personal problems (they do not all). Along with her new partner (Wet Ben Chaplin), she is invited to investigate the murder of a young woman. There is nothing unusual about them except that those committed are adolescent students who believe they planned and carried out the ideal murder. As the investigation continues, the battle of will erupts between Casey and the main suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> The issue before us is that the two lists trust. Bullock, although she is very nice to look at, she does believe the role of hardcore cop like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, it would be better!). Chaplin, because of his sins, is an incomplete entity, and I am sorry that he put this film on his autobiography in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Jossling and Pitt, as cynical suspects, stand out enough. As if the evasive presentations were not bad enough, the story would send anyone to sleep and end up dramatically (but irrationally) shooting this film in the head before he had a chance to show. <br /> <br /> "Murder in Numbers" has nothing at all, so a useless scene by Bullock will not replace it ... Well, just a little bit but not enough to save it ... You can forget it, expect it and its surplus - this one movie will not pay The type of conditional forward ... As Casey says most likely about her next case, there is nothing to see here.
