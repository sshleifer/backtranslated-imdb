The movie starts with some scrolling text that takes about five minutes. It gives a basic summary of what is going on. It was possible to do this easily through representation but instead you get the scrolling text effect. Soon after you were bombarded with characters you learn little about, keep in mind that this is all you will learn about them. The plot begins to land and then the whole movie crashes. Not only does the plot change, but you may also ask yourself whether you are watching the movie itself. I never played the video game, but I know who they have. From my understanding, whether you have played the game or not, this movie will not improve. Save your money unless you like to sleep in theaters.
