I will never forget the brilliant intelligence and comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation! The pace lines and timing events in this movie are fantastic! However, the completion of European holidays this is a game of great disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswalds wins a European holiday in a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are a little more than just laughed "ha ha." For example, an air host on a Clark plane asks, "Do you want coke in the can?" Clark replies again, "No, I'll get him here." It really is the only funny line in this film. <br /> <br /> The tension of European humor. As if the book borrowed all the jokes from the first film, and tried to rewrite the script that was done before, relying on the scene sequence chasing silly silly slap at the end of the picture just to kill time. <br /> <br /> Even worse is that natural comedy talents such as Randy Quaid like Eddie Cousin and the original boys who played Rusty and Audrey from the first film were well not found. Their alternatives are not funny, they can not act, and seem to be undergoing movements most of the time. There are also some rude sexual jokes and comments that are not only funny but are also of bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald's was supposed to stay at Wally World. The place that made them legends! Do not join them in this horrible European adventure. Viewers should re-watch the original "Holiday" movie instead! You'll be glad you did.
