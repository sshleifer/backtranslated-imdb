This third Pokemon is so abstract that younger children can not follow it and repeat it so they can not entertain older children. The film's message - about dealing with loss - stumbles on the return of the young girl's father during the credits of the film. Team Rocket provides some fun, but it's not part of the small plot, so it does not show much.
