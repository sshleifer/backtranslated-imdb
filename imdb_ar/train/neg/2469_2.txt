I assume that if you like the endless dialogue that does not redirect the story and the brilliant camera effects such as the scene transitions in the TV show _Angel_, you will enjoy the film. I? All I wanted was a nice little story, and it was not there. The speed was virtually backward, and the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was no sense of terror or tension or anything at all. Is it Wendigo? No, he's a photographer quickly. This is not scary. It does not produce a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you are afraid of MTV. Like those reviewers who are in front of me, I also noticed that in the end, the film evokes a mocking laugh from the audience. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie.
