I bought Bloodsuckers on Ebay website for some time. I saw parts and considered them very stupid to review them again. The excess amount of water "water" in the beginning is just a vintage - not to mention the "whip" wind sounds. My friends and I have made a very low budget film, and the influences still outweigh this clown. <br /> <br /> As for the amount of errors in this film, there is much to be counted. I knew one actor - believe it or not, it was my drama teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not worry about this "horror". <br /> <br /> 3 Stars (out of 73 possible)
