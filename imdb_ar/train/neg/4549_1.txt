Amateurs better describe the cinematic adaptation of the bestselling philosophical novel, The Celestine Prophecy, which follows the spiritual awakening of an outside teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Video quality representatives at home offer so-called characters that launch an evolving exhibition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is promoted through the very strong direction of Armand Mastroianni. Although there are clear attempts to measure up to the most interesting fans to no avail from the film "Lost" from "ABC" or "Dan Da Vinci" by Dan Brown, the filmmakers are hardly on the task level. This film is the spiritual propaganda that many people consume badly, and the results are very bad, as little can go into this mess to discover a real point.
