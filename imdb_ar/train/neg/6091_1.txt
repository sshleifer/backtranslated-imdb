I bought this excruciatingly provocative movie, on the top, a bloodbath. I did not get any of them. This film fails at almost every level, not at the least frightening or funny level. It is simply a terrible film industry and does not provide the audience with anything worth watching. What is so bad is that, far from being as cruel, violent and brutal as she has promised, there is very little violence at all. Almost no shedding of blood, no excitement at all. Representation, direction and dialogue are unbearable at all. Frankly, it's really funny. I can hardly sit through this whole garbage once; I certainly will not want to see it again. Do not waste your time with celluloid wasting like this; it's really probably the worst movie ever. If I could give it minus stars,
