Very impressive. "Fluctuations" can be predicted, if you have watched any movies over the past ten years, and the few parts that are somewhat interesting (where someone uses context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much lightness, because the "secret" (The spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The representation is appropriate enough The story is simply not very interesting The "still awake" hypothesis is all canceled out by things (Not kidding). <br /> <br /> The surgical scene was tense at first, but it was a bit annoying, but then it became quite normal. <br /> <br /> It is not terrible But, remember, the role of Terence Howard is the least interesting yet, as far as I've seen. <br /> <br /> Kind of boring, in general.
