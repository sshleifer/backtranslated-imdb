This film describes the experiences of a couple of successful men (one of them Bert Reynolds), a prostitute and two watch queens for a few hours one night in Miami. The converging stories eventually gather all the people together in one place and time. The film was rather fun, but the big problem was that everything happened at night and that many scenes were so literally exposed that it was impossible to see what was happening. In a few scenes, you can already see where they tried to "extend" the development process to save images. Someone did not know how to play the movie camera. Surprisingly this movie was even released!
