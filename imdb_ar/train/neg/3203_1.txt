Joe Don Becker (MITCHELL) starring in the film "The Work", a dull and uncommon, such as Rep. Geronimo, a dirty gazelle sitting around him in the stupid cowboy suit, listening to the country music and eating a lot of cakes. Meanwhile, a mysterious criminal man named Palermo (played by the man who has the training in "The Gates of Hell from Folsi") stumbles into the area of ​​Joe Dunn and shoots Sharif in a bad scene of liberation. Joe Don - slowly - gives chase and Palermo's brother after he uttered the catch phrase now - it's your movement. Think you can take me? Well, continue. For some reason, Joe Dunn, a lawyer in Texas, has to move Palermo to Italy ("Mr. Palermo was a major embarrassment for the Italian government," says Wilson, another mysterious figure played by Bill McKinney, who was at MASTER NINJA. 1, SHE FREAK, and lots of good East Clint movies). <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, an airliner must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with the help of a suitcase and a man like John Loftz. Here the film stops. For the rest of the film, Joe Don looks for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in the prison cell, and the Maltese police chief yells at him, then leaves with a warning not to search for Palermo anymore. Jo Don goes on to search for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in the prison cell, and the Maltese police chief yells at him, then leaves with a warning not to search for Palermo anymore. Jo Don then searches for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in the prison cell, and the Maltese police chief yells at him, then leaves with a warning not to search for Palermo anymore. This is a tight film. <br /> <br /> At one point Joe is believed to be dead at sea. All other characters wonder whether he has died or not, and finally concluded that he is. But then shows up (saved by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he lost in the sea for several days. Even his sweetheart, Julia-Louise-Dreyfus-Isaac never welcomes him again. However, he offered his help in finding Palermo, so Jo Don looks for Palermo, loses Palermo, and ends up in the prison cell. The Maltese police chief shouted at him and then left a warning not to search for Palermo anymore. <br /> <br /> Highpoints include a strange carnival with strange colored floats, some exciting strippers, a baby wearing clothes like Napoleon and a cart of tomatoes, a hunting scene of a man wearing a monk's uniform, and any scene without an atmosphere. Joe Lowpoints include a threat stripper with coat hangers. <br /> <br /> Please note that this is from Greyon Clark, ANGEL'S REVENGE's manager, who appears as a police chief. Ick! <br /> <br />
