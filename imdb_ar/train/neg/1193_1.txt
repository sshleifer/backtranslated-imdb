Do you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings in the film? Well this was beyond that. I bought a DVD in Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I was hearing that this movie could laugh at it. It's really pathetic. After about 30 minutes of the film, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes beg me. An hour later, we gave up progress quickly to the end, so we could see how the dispute was resolved (and because we were watching all the time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, you do not see this movie. It transcends pain.
