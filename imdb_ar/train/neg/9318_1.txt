Maybe this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Again, you made a mistake buying the film because the clasp on the back looks great and the front cover looks very impressive (after buying this movie and the film "The Grudge" I reviewed here too, I learned the lesson). I love horror movies that happen in the jungle or in the desert or on a farm. This is supposed to happen in the Texas Forest but may have been filmed in the backyard of the director. Maybe the production was the worst I've ever seen. The actors were the worst at all. The story has nothing to do with what the back cover said. So I tried to sell them to F.Y.E and some other "mom and pop" stores that bought used DVDs and would not take them. This is how horrible this unfortunate excuse for Cannes was. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I did not think there was a worse movie than Troll 2. The boy was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but do not get stuck with it unless you get rid of it which is what I'm about to do !!!!
