I was looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing "Back to Heaven", which I found brave. I was very disappointed. The most realistic thing about this subject is the unexpected end that I think was partially stolen from "Back to Heaven". <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected a lot. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, both Beckinsell and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like the character of the Danes and found them very troublesome. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the film. This could have been done much better, for example, there could be more emphasis on prison conditions and extreme terror. It was a very delightful film to be realistic. There can be more movement and tension. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" ending. I could not have predicted that. But by that time, I did not really care about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
