The main flaw in the film is its uninspiring text. Accumulate back and forth between the short stories of my story and the re-creation of short films. While Klaw is well recreated, it does not have to be completely rebuilt. Richards' page, although not an amazing actress, does a good job overall. Sometimes, it bears a striking resemblance to my home. It is worth noting is some of the insured's attention to detail. Fashion clothing is well, as in some specific direction. Sets are usually different and feel the r stage, but do not feel the times. Sometimes they are surprisingly brightly lit, and the color palette is clearly thought out to give the overall appearance a vibrant feel.
