This film was absolutely awful. I can not think of one good thing about it. The plot holes were so huge that you could drive a Hummer through them. The acting was so bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, that's what a lot say !!! Dialogue, what dialogue? To believe that I am a fan of the first comments (I use this comment loosely, it's more like guilt, than anything else). This movie was Goldberg's loud scream !!!! Nothing good can come from this film. What makes this movie even worse is that it is very bad and you can not watch it with a group of friends to enjoy !!! This must be in the worst five films of all time. 2/10 because it is very hard for me to give 1.
