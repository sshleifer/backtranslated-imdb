I was supposed to review this for a website, and I watched this with optimism that it might have been at least an armed rip, but it did not do it well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural movies I have ever seen (worse than "Godsend") with scenes that tear "The Omen" shamelessly. The end is very similar to the way the "omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that representation, writing and the whole story have been hacked. If these films reap money, I'm sad to know where the "asylum" is headed. It's embarrassing.
