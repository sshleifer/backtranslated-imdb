My God. The idea that this film is a very exciting film. Along with a point that seems to be 5 years old. The plot, acting and even props and filming of this film were beyond shame. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually important to any film, because everyone has his style. But this film, probably, was the worst film I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this film is unknown, and I think it should stay that way, because films like this make the thriller kind of a joke. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone who likes thrills, or even just films to get away from this movie.
