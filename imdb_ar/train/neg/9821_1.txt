I often do not watch such a horrific film. I continued watching, every minute I hope to have intended a joke only to find that they were taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this type. <br /> <br /> The acting was disappointing and the positions were awesome and vulgar. If a film was produced in 1920 (for example) and the quality of Hide & Seek was in its direction, we would think that the cinema at the time was naive. As it happens, this film was made in 2000 and I have not yet seen a silent film with a little charm like this film. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for serious filmgoers. <br /> <br /> [Not worth rating]
