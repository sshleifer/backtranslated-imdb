Why do I watch movies like this? - other than I have some misguided masochistic alien beliefs that one day I will find a real gem among all this malice and I can not think of a good reason. This film was slag from start to finish - but slag is almost hilarious. Anywhere else, but in a bad Mdbalij movie you can find hot exchanges of distorted English language surrealism like this between a sincere military type and a wicked head of secret X files like an organization dedicated to hiding the "truth": <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Silence is It is best for us to prove that UFOs are not aggressive. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I find your intervention abusive. <br /> <br /> A man in black: Everyone who has to impose his will is. <br /> <br /> The DVD (you know what I mean) has been prepared half a dozen times, and I still can not make these lines mean anything reasonable. My other line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be very strict with those who run counter to our interests." <br /> <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this meager store of a film were for me to represent the photographer's personality at first. The man toured the worst hair story ever in the history of everything. He was walking around him looking like a fish in a bad wig until he was kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of glass by some foreigners. Foreigners are not perceived more effectively as a POV shot - a portable camera with a fish eye lens - a kind of nervousness at first, but it has been used repeatedly and lost its strength (by coincidence, if it is a point of view and that means that foreigners always go out From the rooms back for some reason). <br /> <br /> The film was shown in England. This means Italian Italian designers put some British number plates on a number of English cars and put Union Union on the press card of our heroes ... That was it. There is no other attempt to make it look like the UK at all. <br /> <br /> A favorite moment? When Foley's artists did not notice that the characters they were stealing (was there such a word?) No longer walked on the gravel, but were now in the garden, so their feet remained screaming loudly! Noise. Otherwise, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they will prove that these alien objects have no combat motives soon ...
