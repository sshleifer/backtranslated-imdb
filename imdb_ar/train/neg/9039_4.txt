A noble effort, I think, but ultimately a poor endeavor. Before watching this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was unforgettable. After seeing him, I still do. Unfortunately, I think that only those who read the story are the ones who will understand what is going on, and will be upset by the unnecessary reviews of the film (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the wonderful talent of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me like a good faith effort but a misguided effort to film the classic metaphysical Melville film.
