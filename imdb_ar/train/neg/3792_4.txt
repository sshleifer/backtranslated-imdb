I have seen lots and lots of products from Nutcracker. Maybe now I saw this film from a polluted point of view for a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that the people who work in ballet dance find this production impressive, but from a purely theater point of view, I found everything from design to choreography to the dull and inappropriate "animation." None of the traditional "exotic" costumes were as impressive as they were supposed to be (ie, the candy was not like candy, the mice were not like mice, they were like chocolate kisses), the acting was weak, perhaps very toned on the screen, and Choreography does anything for me. This makes the whole presentation very satisfactory (at best), as if it were meant not to distinguish itself from any other production. But remember, again, this is from the artistic perspective of the stage director, not a dancer or a dance designer, but a straight male theatrical director.
