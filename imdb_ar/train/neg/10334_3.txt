The story of the remarkable lack of attention kills "psychic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninterested (as in the work of the crazy Fulci camera, which is usually a recovery factor in his movies), and can not find any suspense anywhere. It's unbearably padded - in the end, you will not scream with excitement but you're bored (and maybe like me there might be an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves a better film. Beware of the Fulci rocks - there is not much going on in "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
