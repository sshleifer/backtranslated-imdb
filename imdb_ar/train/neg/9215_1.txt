Check the spoiler alert immediately. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen, I felt like laziness and monsters as if I had wasted 101 minutes of my life. The quality of replacing the only film was the scenes I tried to be serious, but ended up being funny because it was so bad. Evil Dead Anyone? Unfortunately for mergers and acquisitions (fortunately for us), they did not evolve into cult tracking and lead to a trilogy. This film attempted to address a series of problems encountered by the main character, Ruby (played by Hanks) throughout the film. It ended up being a video that promotes fear about stereotypes that helped fuel D & D, the devil's movement in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, stay away from this junk. <br /> <br /> PS - Although the cover looks a little fun, that's why I think my brother bought it, it does not happen in any fantasy world, unless you consider New England or New York City a place like this.
