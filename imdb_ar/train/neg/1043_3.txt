What a bad movie bad !!! I can not believe all the fuss that fascinated this amateur humming excuse for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, surprised by the loss of direction of this film and the work of the camera! And to read the adoration pits that claim to be a reality in this film, while all in fact is a shameless attempt to attract wool to the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and painstaking. <br /> <br /> At least, this film has shown me once and for all that the Sundance Film Festival has become a complete joke and its presentation here is more than just a bad film industry than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. You want your time again! I know I did.
