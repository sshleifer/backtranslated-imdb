I should really watch a good movie soon, because it seems that every other entry or so is something I despise. Although my history speaks, I must not tell lies. Bobby Deerfield and everything around him absorbs the big green banana peel. I never thought I would see a film as cloudy as it was with this film. Al Pacino does not act in this film: he pretends. There are many scenes for his character, a race car driver, just staring at the camera. It's absolutely horrible. Marth Keller is just as bad. These two people are supposed to be in love, and there is no chemistry at all. Sydney Pollack took out this film? There is no trace of the geniuses behind Tutsi here. Is this the same guy I was happy with in Eyes Wide Shut? I can not believe that. Save yourself an awesome movie experience. Run, do not walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
