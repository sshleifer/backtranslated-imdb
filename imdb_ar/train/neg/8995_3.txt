I missed the start but I saw most of them. A friend got a DVD in the cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> All short videos are very short, yet most of them are still long. The majority of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something funny! A lot of racist / sexist humor / "homophobia," stereotypical plays, or plays that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I try to remember anything I thought was funny. , And I'm having a problem ... The Tunnel Vision logo is a red lips mouth with a handle. The mouth opens and closes on the eye like the eyelids. Kind of creepy. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors went to better things, and fortunately the bomb did not stop them.
