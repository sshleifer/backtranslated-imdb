This was really a waste of time ... The movie film plot is weak, and the story is fragmented and suddenly ends with many loopholes .... Although the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of doubting by telling myself it might become interesting in the next stage, but it was not unique before. The plot was played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the main hole in the masterplan was the whole story of how to kill the bad guys ... The writer could have done a lot in the whole sense, but he did not seem to have her heart and wanted to close the movie once Start it. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a lot of noise but is unable to display.
