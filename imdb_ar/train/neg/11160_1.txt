This type of saccharine is "inspiring" enough to get you sick. She cancels her feelings like the biggest sign on earth. It removes the public's interpretation and feeling by making choices. The big end swimming in a crying orchestra should work like the jumper cables on a dead car. I think you will need this feeling even if you are stupid enough to watch a simple and happy movie like this. Streep glows and wonders whether it already has a depth of feeling on the screen or is it just a screen, it is turned on and off like a light. Because I can not over my life see how you can find life in such an intermittent movie. Although it is based on a true story, and an inspirational story in this I am sure, the setup, implementation and performance are played as a third-rate television drama or semi-heavy drama.
