Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, one line summary shows everything. Melville "Le Samurai" is the original, there are elements of "Leon". They are the best - much better! <br /> <br /> In the movie "Samurai," Alan Dillon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in a cage and steals cars in search of his jobs (with a lot of suspense in these scenes!). To the very end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks to die with dignity and shoots him with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed and he knows that there is no place for the samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Dillon does not kill as many people as a ghost dog. But I think that Garmusch likes "Leon" pretty much or even "Desperado" for Rodriguez. This is also added. Let me guess: will the girl become a professional like a ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in the film "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what was Garmusch thinking after all? Where is the unique, original idea in this film? <br /> <br /> I can not see the point in making copies of carbon (celluloid). <br /> <br /> Rated 4/10 by Connor Macaulay
