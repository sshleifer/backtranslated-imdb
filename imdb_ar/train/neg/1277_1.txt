This film still cools me up thinking about it. This movie was not as bad as it was in the low budget, it was a bad behavior, etc., although it certainly had all these things. The problem with this film is that it seems to be deliberately trying to annoy the viewer, and it did so with great success. What I want to know is, is it supposed to be a horror film? I mean it's definitely terrifying, but not the way it's supposed to be horror movies. I can see the first part tries to terror and failure, but what the hell is the second part? It's just annoying. The third part looks like watching a student's film, making it less surprising which makes it the least painful part. It's terrible that this movie is not low in the list of 100 people, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know some people have made these good reviews, but they are lying in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Trust me, it's impossible to love this movie. The only benefit of this film is the amazing effect of life: it seems you've been watching this movie for years after just half an hour.
