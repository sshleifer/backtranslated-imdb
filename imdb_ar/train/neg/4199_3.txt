A very poor effort does not offer anything to anyone but a fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our leading man. <br /> <br /> By far the only trick around which the story of this new naughty vendor of the alarm company is going, is its strange side-by-side. But without a realistic background, these characters are useless. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
