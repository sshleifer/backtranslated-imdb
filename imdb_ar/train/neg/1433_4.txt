The photos are wonderful and well reflect the landscapes of Canada. The story, on the other hand, was very boring; for my eye it was a love story in the woods just like the story of Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not feel that the Gray Owl was wonderful in protecting the environment. I usually love Lord Attenborough but this was bad.
