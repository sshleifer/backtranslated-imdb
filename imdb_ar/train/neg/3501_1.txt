I understand jokes well, they are not good. The offer is terrible. I understand, this is another terrible thing about it. The only wonderful character ever present in the show was that one of the prospects in that episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is terrible. This is not funny, not funny! I do not want people to say, "Only smart people get it" because if they are smart, why do they judge people who do not even know them and say that they are not smart or intellectual enough to understand? It's like saying "sky is red" but never look outside. But anyway, this is the worst show I've ever seen in my life, awesome jokes, I mean that you can understand it, it's just horrible, its very lame arguments, its fart jokes, and other jokes on the body really stupid liquids are usually made of really bad behavior. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they know nothing about any of us is not just an intelligent comment.
