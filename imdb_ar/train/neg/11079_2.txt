Over several years of searching for inappropriate movies to rent to my children, I have developed a sixth sense to get you into direct, cheese-and-direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit (for anyone over the age of eight). I dropped the ball on this one and the children spent half the movie asking me "What did she say about that?" And "Why did he do that?" My eyes were rolling every minute or so, as the characters did a really bad job of making random plot changes. The next time a person decides that the sword is not at all skillful is to "bring realism" to a movie, please run it with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" The head and shoulders were above this. Arrgh.
