It does not really matter that Superman comic books are incredibly naive and that their goal is 10 years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad film. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, I asked you, dear readers, how many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers here. So let's get to know some of the key issues right now. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like a commercial (the scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking, Budweiser is the only scene that seems to be supposed). Imagine the Superman business, two and a half hours. Let's be serious this is not "Amadeus" or "Departing". Already feel that this film is too long. Special effects are not special. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is ridiculous. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in comedy, the cinema seems stupid. This is the case in this case. Of course the dialogues are a shame. I can not believe that anyone took the money to write it. How many times will we feed on our evil sermons? How many times will laws of physics be raped? (Jesus, it is not only a matter of Superman's power but also resistance to the material he deals with.) How many times will Louis Lane be fooled by Kent? How many times do Hollywood producers look for a story in trivial comic books? Since it's hard to make a good story, why do you have a weak story for beginners? It just does not work. Men, get a grip. Try harder, please. Or just stay in this strike forever, who cares. I felt that WGA was in a permanent strike. I do not mean to underestimate you. I'm not wondering about the lame money that these people pay, but about the quality of the product they offer. In this case there is no quality at all. (At this point, you may ask yourself: Is this bad?) Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, representation is weak, which is quite surprising because Brian Singer (the usual suspects) directs them. Kevin Spacey enjoys, but he is the only one. The audience is not rather in the mood for jokes. The thing is that the comic book hero can be developed to become a real character, with clear motives but also with doubts, fears and some depth. In this case, no one did the job, the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the entire creative effort turns this film into a parody. The second unit is very bad and that attracts attention, because there is nothing interesting happening on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the more fun (but not the laugh to expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This special movie, Ladies and Gentlemen, is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money either. Stay at home and read a book.
