Where was his criticism of democratic administrations as well as republics? After all, he served for 17 years in a government body where his influence was not firmly established. I have forgotten his eight years in leading the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show young Senator Gore asking why the NASA scientist had to change a conclusion in his science paper, but failed to question Clinton's involvement in global warming. Perhaps very close to the election year, or perhaps harm Hillary's chances in 2008. In both cases he is a political coward and a party man until the bitter end. It does not offer any criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, and no way of industrial development history that has led us to this time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film was more about Mr. Gore himself than any real problems facing our environment . Mr Gore If you really want to produce a movie drive - sum it up and label it what it really is.
