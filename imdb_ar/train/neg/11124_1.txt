I do not generally worry much about violence in films, or a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good with me, and the film brings us much of the above. There are beautiful pictures especially for lake and nature, good preparation for characters, and good direction. This movie can be rated as a good film. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons regarding making this film simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First, there is violence used against living organisms to make this movie. No violence film, I am talking about real violence. This violence can be justified alone if not, and this is the second reason. The film's message was not merely a reflection on the twisted relationship between the directors and the women. It does not mean that we all do not have some real transformations with women (men respectively). But the end of the film destroys everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * "Hero" finally dies, (from here, if I remember correctly that I watched this movie years ago, it has angered me, now the guy came out with a new movie witch I certainly will not see) More clearly as a kind of natural devil, nature grows on her, especially her sex .. Of course, the director is the one who "kills" the heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** end spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well, it may all be well with me if the manager has kept his eyes on himself. But to use large images, technical guidance and cruelty of living creatures, simply to say that men can be afraid of women, men are cruel to women. This just is not enough. I knew when I saw this film that he would achieve good critics of "philosophical, oriental and artistic" and whatever it was. But for me this film is completely young.
