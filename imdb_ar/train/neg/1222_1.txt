This is a seriously disturbed film. Although the boys deserved some of what they got ... the sadistic executions were a bit "sad" on the top. The only character that showed some conscience was killed early in the search before he could offer some help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be some promise of a mediocre relationship, but it was just a trick to calm viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what came. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the film for me was if Jack Nicholson jumped out of the jungle and cried out, "Where is Spider-Man?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> Now that would be great!
