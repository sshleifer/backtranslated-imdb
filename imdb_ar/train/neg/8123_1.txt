(Spoilers) Wow, this is a bad one. I doubled when I saw an old Star Trek episode the other day - that was the case where everyone gets sick with space and then they go a little bit, and there was Stewart Moss, nicknamed the "hero" unlikely for It Lives at night! He played the first crew of the injured crew, and died of severe depression. All I was thinking about was that he had seen his own movie several times and that was what caused depression. This movie is full of really unwanted people. There is no character in the film is not one. It's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck turning into a racket (or anything you actually turned into), because you do not like him. And you do not like his scream, his great wife or the bad sergeant. Ward, or Dr. Moustache Love ... So why invest any time or energy in this film? When there is no sympathy for the characters, there is no reason to bother you to pay attention to them. Not to mention the horrific cinematography, which made him seem to have shot the film through urine, and the effects of five bat dances, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown in a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but definitely there in the lower ranks.
