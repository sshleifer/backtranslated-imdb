The original classic exploitation - although it is far from fun at almost any level with respect to some men who turn cats into human bodies eating monsters because the cat food they make with people is renewed with the addition of scientific elements. Can not get enough cats and when the food runs out of contaminated meat the cats turn on their owners. This is a bad situation at almost every level, and this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to play cinemas in the early 1970s with cat racing and exotic dogs struggling to excel. Director Ted Mekel is a hacker, but he is a very lovable person (I love this person generally thanks to his interviews on smile and suspension tracks) so you can pretty much excuse the garbage that most of them have come out with. Mikkels wanted to make films and did not care how they appeared as long as he produced something. More strength for him, but I hope we will not be subject to his home movies
