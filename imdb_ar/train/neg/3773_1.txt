When people ask me what is the worst film I have seen in this film. It's not close to upgrading the MST3k, or watching Midnight at the theater, or even as Disney Channel late at night. The only time I wanted to jump on a trip to Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracy's jacket off the fashion model, tear it into her body, and remove it under the guide of tour guides. "Eat this! Eat this dark coat of holiness!" I was not angry at any film, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Want beautiful colors and cinematography? Not here my love. The reviewers continue to say, "Oh, but it also seems to be a comic book," Well, for me, color Gordito after several weeks in the sun. About very enjoyable. My house wanders around this natural landscape and walks around with his watch, sometimes with other actors, hoping that someone will tell him when the shooting will start. To be fair, I saw this film only once, but my threshold of pain is that the man is not from God.
