This time he became the hero of the first human film, this time using the fist and foot sets against the superlative world soldiers and the computer that is shaking and preparing to take over the world. I'm sure he was a double team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Dam is no longer credible in providing exciting clicks. Yet it was this who had discredited him forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as tedious as Double Team or The Quest, it is still truly terrifying, with no style and blending between the original pairing and the star. This sequel is made up simply for children who enjoy professional wrestling. I look back, the sequences were not so exciting events, so this film is worthless. In other words, another clunker is in the assembly line for Van Damme. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
