I've been looking for this movie since ages because it's very rare to find it because it was one of the malicious videos. I finally found a DVD at the end of last year, it's a very low-budget movie. The story revolves around the Amazonian jungle tribes living in fear of Satan. Laura Crawford is a model caught by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her to the forest Laura is guarded by some silly mother who calls herself the "devil" and she has to go despite all the unpleasant things to be happy. Chained up to the virgins. Satan demonstrates eating meat in a horrible way. Peter Weston, is a demon hunter, who goes into the forest to try to save her,
