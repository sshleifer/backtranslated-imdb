I enjoyed the film a lot, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain any violence, sex, drugs or special effects, and only needs it once, drawing my attention all the time with visual images, story and words of wisdom crossed. <br /> <br /> However: [1] some foreign language dialects have made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] there is unnecessary redundancy in oath performance (especially the word F, which is the only reason for R movie classification). [3] The film is balanced with humor and passion, but most of the emotions that keep you throughout the film, except the last minute precision, are unpleasant because of the long-term mixed reaction of some characters on loss, who live in the depths of bitterness and depression for a very long time. [4] I will not recommend this film because of the five seconds of the back story, which did not add one thing to the sidebar that applies to it, or the movie - the film turned me off and stopped me hoping for the entire film and beyond: the mother of the original ancestors of Germany, Old World War II "secret roots of the Germans." There will be no "local color" or art if the Nazi wins the war. I do not know any Germans today except the skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
