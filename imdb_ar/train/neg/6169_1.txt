As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror film and I also think that Nekeddo burâddo looked very good. I looked at the plot, read the reviews and looked at some pictures to make sure it looked like a good and scary movie to watch before downloading. Very excited I had finished and ready to fear and recoil in horror at the amazing Gore I was expecting I was terribly disappointed. The plot was silly and illogical and left a lot of inexplicable reasons, and the bull was Farhana somewhat horrifying, and what was with the sound effects of the animation style? Maybe acting was the only scary thing about this. I did not understand the idea of ​​cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after the flashing light, leaving both of them completely unexplained, or maybe I missed it because my mind could not understand what I was already seeing. I really appreciate the way it was meant to be; surely the scenes were shocking and some scenes (eats strange and kissing your mother?), I think they went away a bit and not in a terrifying way, they made it unconvincing, making it more believable comedy than horror in my opinion. However, it is a very enjoyable movie and got a lot of laughter from me and it is two friends, but unfortunately we were expecting horror not comedy so worth watching entertainment value, but do not expect the dark, scary and scary movie depth. You just have to be disappointed. If this is a comedy / horror spoof I probably appreciated about nine, its climax is the strange scene when the husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but a terrible sponsor gave him a voice.
