This is probably one of the worst films, "I Want to Be Low-Budget Films," for this type of dinosaur. You can predict the movie so much that you can go away, cook your own food, answer the phone or anything, and when you return you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so bad that you think Lego bricks were used and the "super-fast" dinosaurs were so poignant that the dog Eliva looked like a super predator. Acting is over. They are trying hard, yet there is not enough personal behind them to get into the characters and in relation to the world ... Yeah well, we know exactly what will happen exactly to a blonde chick in glasses. Stereotypes were created for movies like this. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you are not in a serious mood like staff and staff. And if you really are in dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, do not see it, you can break the screen - the facts are far away.
