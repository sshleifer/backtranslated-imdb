I love Seth Green. His appearance on THAT 70s is always worth watching, but last night I felt there was a need to fix it. Four young men inherit an apartment in New York City that most of us will die for. Grandma must be heir to get such a space in the first place. I felt the need for realism. Anyway the plot that got four of the best friends to get this apartment was not reasonable. I would have been thrilled to have had to go with one of their parents who would have provided humorous and dysfunctional views about the show. There does not seem to be much humor in it. I only watch it because it is located before the name "Earl" remains the day of a winning night. I think they should go back and cancel this series and start over. We need more family series involved. What about Seth and his friends moving with his angry parents in the suburbs after a fire burned their place. Can make Dabney Coleman play the role of father and Christine Estabrook, and play the mother and siblings disordered. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing on them.
