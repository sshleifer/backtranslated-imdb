After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured until the end. This film tries to be a romantic comedy and a failure. Weak representation - much worse than the T & A films in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> There are many humor attempts that failed miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Maybe if you are a teenager, this movie will have some appeal, but for those who have seen a lot of movies, you'll know how the film ends after the first 10 minutes. You will spend the rest of your time in agony waiting for the final balances to start. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
