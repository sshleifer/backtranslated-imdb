I think I found the most hated film of women of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film - Lilith was Adam's first wife and was considered incomplete and exiled from the Garden of Eden because she considered herself equal to Adam and refused to submit to him. Look, I took these words directly from the script. Then the film continues, and although she is the heroine of the film, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what men tell her! She ends the movie under the control of The Faith - a group of all males! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the scenario was predictable and FX was bad. Apart from obvious female hatred that is usually more subtle in the modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
