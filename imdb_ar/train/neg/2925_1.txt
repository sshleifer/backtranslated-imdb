After reading many good reviews as well as hearing nice things about her in verbal words I decided to hire Come Undone. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. It was difficult to follow the story because the film was set as a series of memories of the past between the past and the present, which was performed very badly. The characters, despite the efforts of the best actors efforts are flat and uninterested. Sex is nudity more obvious than they need. I never saw a film where they seemed unnecessary to the scheme. The end is very hostile to the climate and leaves many questions unanswered on a story line that has not been well explained to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
