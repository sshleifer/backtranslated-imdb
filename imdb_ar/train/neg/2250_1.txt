Rock star John Norman Howard (Chris Christoferson) The theater singer Esther Hoffman (Barbara Streisand) turns into a night-time musical star. Aster rises as John retreated, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John performs the devastating red highway, which is 160 mph, which makes him fast. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbara Streisand sings well, but you can not take her seriously as a rising star, when she is already a star. The first time she sings in a pub in the back alley, she looks like a solid singing star pouring through the night, not as a struggling struggling trying to launch her singing career. She is very confident, and very professional. Her apartment looks like a page of "Apartment Living", not some of the wall apartment where a real singer is struggling. <br /> <br /> Chris Christoferson deals with self-centered self-rock star role like ... Well, like a singer who tries to be a representative but does not have a great talent for acting. Trend lukewarm, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not acting, lame direction, or slow story. It's hair! After staring at Christoferson's terrifying layouts and the terrifying Strisand in the 1970s for two hours, your eyes hurt.
