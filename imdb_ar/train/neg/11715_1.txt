Haha! You just have to smile and smile if you actually do during this movie. Like saying something about myself I think. I think the film itself was created as a self-test, or as a kind of drug, to take you to a place you've never seen before. When Wittgenstein wrote his first famous philosophical piece, "Tractacus (sp?)", He said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you finished, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder. Then you could get rid of work and see things. Clearly and real understanding. This film is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> As a film, it is without a doubt the worst film I have seen in a long time in this unique way. First of all, this is snipers. I loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies. I have suffered through a few weak ones. However, although you know that the movie may suck, you will never doubt that it might be as bad as it already was. It is so fun. This means snipers. You know it may be good, but it will be fine, right? Smile. <br /> <br /> If this thing on every level is full boredom, lack of pure intimacy. The reference to the professional has become dead and clear, but it was so bad that it was comic. There is no single character in this interesting film, at least. To make the whole thing more surreal, they have soundtracks like this kind of sound like parts of various Bourne identity films, is not quite true. In fact, although they look close to background music for motion pictures, this happens quite in a way that excites you in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Then all the scenes on the pitch are completely black, since frankly because the characters are too flat, you do not really care what happens, but regardless, after that happens and kill someone, you just tell yourself, was it Should I see it? What then? What about the depth-ridden scenes, the abhorrent luminosity in the frequency of powerful lights, for too long to bear. Sure, let's take a look at this question. When you strain and can not handle your eyes anymore, do more of these things in the dark kill where you do not really see what happened. Moreover, lets face it do not matter. I've been bored from the start. <br /> <br /> So I drifted out and out several times, but I caught almost all of this film. It becomes something you can watch, without your mind being occupied at any level, and thus becomes something that you can effectively abandon, begin to think about your life, where you go, wherever you are, what we are. <br /> <br /> This is ... this is the true magic of this movie.
