I would not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I was expecting something good but I think that Homebeck Hayne Cowon was much better than this. This style was quite old. At every stage of this film, I was hoping for some transformations and what would I get? The girl burns and wins the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Despite their participation, they must get permission for every little step they take. They are very shy even after a lot of meetings. I expected the aunt to be more brutal than that. All I did was bed madly. <br /> <br /> Hello, we have kids too, but we do not watch them and we always have tears in our eyes. This film is a dream. A happy family, a cruel woman, her brother-in-law and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anobam was the best father of the poor bride and now is the opposite. I knew in a way that Mohenisch Behl would be in this film. Anyway I think I'm wasting my time. Give it 2/10.
