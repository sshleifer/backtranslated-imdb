I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure this would be a good movie if anything happened to it. Nothing does. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, you clear it within the remaining 20 minutes. Explicitly. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an active role - which has not been working for some time - in searching for a part he may play as a writer in a supermarket. Visit the supermarket where it works. Nothing happens. I decided to give him a ride home and go to Arby's car, a goal, and wash a car. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Start. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that. But I also do not get Bill Murray clicks "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers." If you like those movies, you might like it. Many people find films such as eccentric or enchanting or - for reasons that get away from me - find the dialog box wonderful. A common device in films of this type is to have a long period of silence / silence after the actor presents a line that is supposed to be meaningful. We know it's meaningful because it follows two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be Palestinian. I do not understand that. For me, these types of movies are not funny, charming or thought-provoking. They're just boring. why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. Without tension. do not laugh. Do not thrill. No reaction. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I go into movies. I can be bored for free. I see weird / strange characters in real life. Go to Target, fast food restaurants, and car wash. These elements do not make films, even if the stars do these things. I pay for entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and want to hear his voice about anything, enjoy. If you want to dab on Paz Vega, you can look at it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. total snoozefest.
