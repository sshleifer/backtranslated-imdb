This is a rigorous review of the demo episode as shown on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The TV came out of my life in 1981, so I did not follow the series or any part of it - which means that I am immune to the nostalgia charm that the moonlight seems to have for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (A potential warning to the spoiler) <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting Pioneer is your basic stranglehold, "Caveman Meets Football Spinning", where a man with a charming red blood manipulates a mischievous woman to achieve what you really want and needs . It is supposed to be the place where "wit" is based in the script was upset about 1950. It also contains some bad writing frankly, as in the scene where the material was destroyed by furnishings instead of shooting the villain, in order to prove Itself as incompetent. Females need masculine help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Valudi is over-seeing the male chauvinist plot in an atmosphere of simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm with her, Moonlighting has stamped a flash on it. <br /> <br /> However, this DVD is essential for all serious fans of Bruce Willis: In addition to the trial episode, it contains the screen test that Willis got the job. Both features show how well Willis' representation was developed between 1985 and 1988/1989 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Embarrassed! <br /> <br /> Rating (I am _am_ admire Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
