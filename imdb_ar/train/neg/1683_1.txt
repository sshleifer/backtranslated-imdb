It's hard to call The Grudge a horror film. At best, it made me jump a bit of a surprise in a few moments. <br /> <br /> If one forgets the frightening dimension and looks at other aspects of the film, he is disappointed again. The representation is fine but not great. The story can be quite interesting at first, while one tries to get what happens. But in the end one understands that there is not much to understand. It seems that "scary" elements have sometimes been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) Watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting, like cutting off islands or looking at the clouds.
