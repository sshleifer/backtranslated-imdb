I tried to impress this program I really did. I purchased the demo movie, first on the VHS and then on the DVD. However, I could not go into this story because her two main characters, Bruce Willis and Maddie (Cybill Shepherd), seemed to be in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit there was an intelligent dialog box in the program, which was an essential part of the TV program's success, and I appreciated much of this dialogue. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this was very much like the old-fashioned comedies of the 1930s and 1940s with males versus females. You get a lot of controversy, accusations, screaming and screaming. It seems that a lot of people like this kind of bickering, but I hate it, so I did not get a Moonlighting wagon. <br /> <br /> Alice Bisley was nothing but an unhappy assistant to Agnes, who was fun. It's too bad to have a little air time. Shepard was nice to the eyes and I think the women would say the same about Willis, but the argument between the two finally got me out.
