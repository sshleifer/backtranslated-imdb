I really wanted to love this Westerner, being a fan of this genre and lovers of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all in this story! Add Gary Cooper as a main actor and looked great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ... it was not. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes later, where I was bored to death. The character of Jean Arthur was rather troublesome, and James Ellison was neither like nor acting like Buffalo Bell. Cooper was not at his best, as if he seemed very woody. This was several years before he reached Prime as an actor. <br /> <br /> In short, he left the Western shot. Head scrolling and watching another oater because most 'em was much better than this one.
