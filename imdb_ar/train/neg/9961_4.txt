Amelia and Michael are married couple who cheat on each other. Amelia has a long lover in the hospital and Michael employs a prostitute who does not please him. The two are hiding with the husband's betrayal, but they manage to communicate with each other in the end. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this shortcut. The direction is clear and direct, something good, the representation is sincere, but the story leaves a bit to the desired level. Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It is a little difficult to see how this story emerges from any other story of infidelity, except that it is greatly reduced and does not seek meaning in it (a welcome change of pace if any). <br /> <br /> I do not know, I might not call these stories because I never experienced them. But I noticed that the blockage in these novels is usually the same, that is, the couple talk together while avoiding contact with the eye by pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. The nice things in the short films are that they offer a little more space to try something different and I would like to see a different shot. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
