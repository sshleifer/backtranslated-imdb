This may be the poorest example of amateur advertising ever. Authors and producers must study German films in their 30s and 40s. They knew how to sell. Even the Soviet-style leader as high-heeled as the god father figure was done better. disappointing. The loss of faith, which was restored in the Church at the last second in time to be "saved" by the Father by Hoover / God, was not so bad. Unfortunately, it looks hasty and not melodramatic enough. Some of the heavenly misty shots of the angelic Hoover at the corner of the screen gesture and gesture - have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover saving only the family and child deserve to be "proven" worth. Unfortunately, other poor people have been filmed as grainy and so good-yet-God Hoover does not help them. The best approach would have been to shoot them drinking spirits to show their justice situation. Finally, the bright scenes and the joy of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from recession) were supposed to fade in the end. We can see how Hoover-God has saved not only this family that is worth, but all really worth. Amateurist at best.
