Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown a marginal improvement as a film director, capturing the title "In the of the King" (Lord of the Rings) and post-September 11 post-offensive e-mail. But then came "Seed" and the counter was reset to zero, which kept his attempt to legitimize and respect that elusive. I am a fan of man? His films show a unique vision, not boring. <br /> <br /> His frustration with the brutal notices of his early films, "Seed," has resulted in a tremendously misleading attempt at social commentary, and the worst blow in creating iconic diacritical myths (Paul often seems to take a page from Rob Zombie Successful "Halloween"). The rival is Maxwell Sidd (Will Sanderson), a mute and a huge gash who kills 666 people and sits waiting for execution; after frying the monster in vain, he rises from the grave in search of revenge for those who put him there ... Thus begins a chain of disorder that is totally unjustified . <br /> <br /> In an attempt to create a new killer in the new millennium at the end, Michael Max Myers or Jason Vorhis, Max Syed is very boring and does not leave an impression, eventually looks like a professional wrestler whohes and performs "tool crimes" on the series Of the victims are both boring. Moreover, the character of Mr. and Paul's "message" contradict each other: the death penalty is wrong, of course, but are we really expected to sympathize with a merciless murderer who left hundreds of corpses in his wake? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Michael Bear behaves like a long-lost brother of James Rimmar's character on "Dexter": a policeman sits at his desk a lot, browses newspaper clippings, watches scenes stop the futile movement of decayed animals and people Trapped in the seed cache. By the time he and a group of cardboard police stormed the Seed cache, the sequence was tall, poorly visualized (almost non-existent lighting), and unattractive (despite the healthy dose of the bull) so much that he made me sleep. <br /> <br /> Poor films are not just about this sequence: "Seed" appears to have been filmed by a drunken cameraman, as the camera picks up and weaves forever, a technique that turns the stomach from the gorge itself. These long-lasting things, which occur very little, draw attention only to the slippery narrative that is almost nonexistent. In 90 minutes, the film spreads enough to be considered a form of torture, which may be Paul's intention all the time. <br /> <br /> A pure genius ... I think the jokes were thrown at me.
