First seen on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mind-3-D on the zombie mind deals with eating the zombie in the flesh in Story 3 in a movie narrative. And yes, we see zombies eat human flesh in three-dimensional parts !! Wow, no! I've been doing it over and over in 2D in a zombie movie but what makes the best zombie movie usually is the basic story and not the actual meat eating. This is what made the original zombie classics good. The meat was introduced as an addition only. We have already been bored by most of the history of these 3-part parts due to lame (such as the twilight zone) that are easy to understand and detect slowly. The last story is actually the story that started the film (the presence of a reporter investigating a ghost town called) and of course we see the meat eating zombie in that story as well. Well, I guess I said enough. See classics, not this three-dimensional feast.
