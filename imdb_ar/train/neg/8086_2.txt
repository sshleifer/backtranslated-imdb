When I first heard about the "solar crisis" and then got loads of actors, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a great actor before. Then I saw him. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For the movie, which includes outer space, the sun, vast deserts and vast metropolises, this is a crowded and suffocating feature. Everyone seems to be clustered near each other, so the camera will not have to be pulled out of sight. <br /> <br /> The effects are good though good; we are talking about the impending destruction of the planet if a team of scientists and soldiers can not disperse a deadly flame. But unlike screaming, sweating and red glow in everything, there is no real sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Do not start at work. What Heiston, Ballance, Matheson, Boyle, and others do in this film without even bothering to act towards the article is guessing anyone. It makes you wonder who did not pay for the other apartments in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> As far as the finish ends .... well, let's just say it is tense and interesting but very few very late in like This effort. If this kind of speed continues during the film, I may be hearing about the "solar crisis" sooner. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for missed opportunities and bad professional movements. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smith keeps his job like this?
