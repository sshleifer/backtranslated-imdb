This film revolves around a family trying to reconcile with the death of the mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> Genoa's plot seems promising, but unfortunately it was empty and without focus. The film consists only of a series of scenes that depict the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons, or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are unnecessary and cumbersome, and completely fail to engage viewers emotionally. The end is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored of "Genova" The only good thing in the film is the sunny weather and Genova's beauty. "Genova" can be an extensive tourist ad for the city, but not as a movie to enjoy.
