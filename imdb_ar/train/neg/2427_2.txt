Do not make mistakes, I love work and revenge, I've seen a lot of them since I was a kid, including "The Mechanik" for another Dolph Lundgreen which is very good. Tony Scott certainly knows how to use the camera and may be a genius in shooting and editing movies. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott explains that instead of using his skills in making "genius" films cleverly, he uses them indisputably to show and compensate for the lack of material Which does not give him his materials. The film "The Man of Fire" approaches two and a half hours when it was supposed to be less than one hour. <br /> <br /> Scott's way of filming and editing this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you to sit in his movie because his camera is moving and really blues the eye and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes MPAA and studios have dubious attitudes about ratings, violence and making PG-13 films, and I suspect that a $ 70 million film consists of a B-movie with a finger-cut character and a bomb In the back of the man and the hand of the man with a gun, all this to avenge the death of a young girl is no longer dead! Go to the format, why does the studio pass a better script because of language or violence ... so ...
