I can not believe that this offer is still rated 9 out of 10. I can see if those sounds are in the first and second seasons, but what would anyone have to continue to evaluate then? I was a great fan of the first season. You're hooked - all mystery, suspense, and unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. By the second season, I was still watching honestly, but I felt a little frustrated that some basic things were not yet explained. Instead of giving you more answers, it seemed like other questions. I like the thrill, but you have to throw people from time to time until you watch them. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not even remember what finally turned off, but somewhere in the second season, he has enough. I'm not a fan of seeing appointments - and obviously you can not miss a loop to keep going. So, it's no longer worth the effort for me. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that they could not have been smarter and more considerate of the loyal masses. I agree with some posters that it seems that ABC has felt greedy and decided to see how long they can extend this offer. They do not realize that in the end, they will lose more fans than they might win.
