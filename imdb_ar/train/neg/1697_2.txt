I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I have everything I did on DVD except for the hotel room and Twin Pix for two hours. So, when I discovered that, I grabbed it and ... and ... what is this? It is a bunch of stunning black and white cartoons painted with eloquence and eloquence. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was imposed on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few dollars as well. Let me make it clear that I did not care about the unwanted language part, but I have to keep my voice tuned because my neighbors may have it. All in all this is a very disappointing version and you may have just left in the deluxe package group curiosity. I highly recommend you do not spend your money on this. 2 of 10.
