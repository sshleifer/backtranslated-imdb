Forbidden Siren is based on Siren 2 Playstation 2 (lots of games). Like most videos that have turned into video games, I would say that the majority does not translate into a very different medium. This also applies, painfully. <br /> <br /> There is a very long introduction explaining and presenting the story hypothesis, the mysterious island by Leo Morimoto and his children, his daughter Yuki (Yuki Ichikawa) and his son Hideo (John Nishiyama) coming to move. Villagers do not seem very friendly, and soon sound advice is given on the sirens on the island, to stay indoors once the sirens begin to cry. <br /> <br /> Naturally slow, things start to bump, and our brothers go on a mission to strike around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its exotic inhabitants. But in fact, you will not care what is going on, where tales of folklore and fairy tales are thrown to commit the plot even more. What he really paid to the world of bad comedy was her unwittingly undocumented moments that made her laugh in a state of utter stupidity, to be explained later. It is something that tries to appear and present something intelligent, but there is something else to do in a convincing way and with covered gaps. <br /> <br /> Even though it's recorded in less than 90 minutes - I think the horror film phenomenon is that run-time scale - it gives that feeling for about two hours with its slow accumulation to know what it wants. Things start to improve in the last 20 minutes, but they are a very late classic case. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes direction and finally reveals it. Again, this is a common device used to try to raise a seemingly simple horror film to something a little extra in the hope of impressing an audience. It turns out to be somewhat satisfactory, but it leaves a bad taste because you will feel a bit cheated. There are two ways you will feel in evolution - it either elevates the level of the movie to an unforgettable level, or gives you this wonderful feeling. Unfortunately, the banned sirens belong to the latter. <br /> <br /> The saving grace will be cinematography using light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be so clear - still not worth the time, so better to avoid this.
