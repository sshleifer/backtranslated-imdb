After the disaster of the first camp of Sleepway, which I think the franchise can be born. SC II is superior in side. More inspiring killings and more fun. Although this may not be much (compared to the first film), Sleepaway Camp II is worth leasing. <br /> <br /> FEATURES: Entertainment, do not take itself very seriously like SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: Strange representation and lots of awards. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
