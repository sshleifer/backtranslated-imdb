Was it an exciting story, as I thought when I saw the cover in the video library? No, was he "thinking about food" because the author was probably trying to make it? Not right. So what was it? It was a very mediocre film, it had great potential and was well directed but let down through a confusing story without strong points, with the beginning of the middle and the end, with the expected misbehavior of the serial killer man, who although he seemed enthusiastic at some delivery points The best performance of the cast overall. It was a great cinematography, in good colors, wonderful things and amazing, beautiful scenes, but it leaves you where you are going and history. And with a feeling let us conclude it quickly in the end. OK to see if there is anything else on TV.
