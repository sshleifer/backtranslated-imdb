What a terrible film. The worst set of cliches I've seen in a long time. This is not much I saw. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a hard drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many expressions of hurt and torture can one person be exposed to? The talents of the chopsticks - as often as they were - were completely lost. Who told Gloria Stephan that she could act? The attempt to correct this film politically continues to impose racist stereotypes. (The brave music teacher, who is very experienced, teaches disadvantaged violinists in the poor neighborhood school). The kids were not cute! Just wrote to fit the apocalyptic script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. Real horror this one!
