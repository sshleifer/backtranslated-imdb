I did not watch any of the previous Spike Lee movies, so I did not care about her trailers. I have seen and admired the works of Denzel Washington and Judy Foster and they have many of their DVDs. I was, however, quite disappointed with this film. If this film shows Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice is to "get a job" and stop wasting time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some other IMDb commentators saw the same movie I saw. I can only assume, from their delightful reviews, that their admiration for Spike Lee has blinded them to the stupidity of this work. I just paid $ 2.50, in the theater "Second Run", and I still feel I wasted my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb page "Trivia" says everything ....... <br /> <br /> * "Snapshot in 39 days" - How can you expect to shoot a large budget "Blockbuster" (As promised by the media hype), in such a short time? No wonder that this performance is weak by everyone. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard would have directed the film first ..." - perhaps this project has achieved some justice, giving more time to do so of course. Although the writing was awful, the assumption had some advantages. <br /> <br /> Well! Maybe not. I'm sorry! The film was full of vulgar scenes, unreasonable scenes, and poor descriptions, so much that he could not have done much. (Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Judy Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - And showed! It was filmed for "Fixer", which makes people disappear, incredible problems like the script that I was given. Did she want to be there? <br /> <br /> The other Beaves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers will be interested in coming to the door, and inform a police officer in uniform that they were inside? Stealing the bank, was better to get away ... or otherwise? <br /> <br /> When Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) comes to the bank to check for no bodies yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, have "led" a policeman, (much less "allow" a policeman ) Back to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Fraser later claimed that he gave the thief "every reason to shoot me." Why, then, in their short struggle, did not even try to reveal the face of the thief? It may have been the response he was looking for ... A thief was shot just to prevent his identification later. And why did Steve, Stevie, Steve-O, (the thief's partner) take a long time to help? <br /> <br /> I understand that these were not your ordinary bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and there was no harm. But the police have no reason to believe they will not. For them it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys went out to "pick up the pizza?" , Were not removed. (First of all, how many thieves would have gone outside without using the hostage as a shield? Is this a copy of Spike Lee from New York City, or MSN?). Reducing them will reduce the number of bad guys, make their plans, and the remaining thieves are likely to surrender. If not, there will be at least fewer bad guys inside. (Give the SWAT something to do, or send it home!) <br /> <br /> What police department in this country would allow Madeleine White (Judy Foster) to walk directly into the bank, discuss a matter with thieves, And they will not reveal them first? It had no authority, no government credentials; moreover, this was after all, "already" a hostage case ... add another one? <br /> <br /> Why did not the bank's executive director (Christopher Plummer) destroy the long-overdue criminal records? Screw the passion! Diamonds, he could sell it. <br /> <br /> * Who was "schmuck", (the character, not the actor), in the Jersey accent, which volunteered easily, he knew the recording was "100% Albany", but he could not speak it ... .. Sir! Put your hand down! And his former wife! What a "schlump" was !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * When interrogating suspects, why did Deet do. Frazer, constantly harassing individuals who were not obviously part of the theft? , (Ie tell the old woman she can go, and then could not, then can not, then can not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demanding that the hostages put on the jump wings, could not conclude from the escape plan that included getting out of the bank pretending to be some hostages? <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, a fake wall was displayed in the showroom, where Clive Owens hid behind for a week ... Where did the material come from? (Drywall and pins). They were also supposed to have cut the sewer, so he could ease himself. Did not the bank staff complain about the smell all week? Hi! <br /> <br /> After this disaster, since the documents "fell" into the hands of the thief, what kind of "references" did Ms. White expect from the bank's CEO, seeing that he was now a target of extortion because of her failure? <br /> <br /> * Finally, but certainly not least, what is the thing that Dinsel did with "electric skidding"? How stupid this is! Was he supposed to refer to his "determination" to bring these men to justice? He looked, instead, like a man jumped on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Unlike the middle plot; poor script representation and bad overall pitiful guidance ...... Yada, Yada, Yada. <br /> <br /> We hope this provides enough insight into the film to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
