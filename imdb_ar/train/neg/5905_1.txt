Do not see this. This was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It's hard to have mormons sometimes when there are movies like this there. What a sad view of Mormon life. I can tell you if you've seen this movie that it's not like that at all in an individual suite. If so, I do not think I would have passed it. It's very bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing to do better. The acting was so bad that my wife and I barely managed it. I think you could say that he had all the B movie marks. Or are there movies C? Anyway ... I think this movie sucked and it was full of cheese. I hope some Mormons will start producing some high-quality films.
