I was terrified of this strange film. What an unusually dark atmosphere. This musical result is creepy. Really promising! In fact, after ten minutes really begin to sweating and feeling uncomfortable, because you start to fear the worst. This film enjoys an atmosphere of real nightmare, and worst of all. For an hour and a half, I was trying to fight full boredom and sleep, but the brutal soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly terrifying picture - for your eyes, ears, and intelligence, and most of all: your purse, because thinking about spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateur sitcom is the biggest horror ever.
