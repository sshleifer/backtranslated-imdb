I had high hopes in this film, although he got a bad review in the newspaper. I was very tolerant and sat through the entire film. I felt completely ill by the end. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not in a neighborhood that is particularly weird or sensitive to tasteless movies - I enjoyed all of Woody Allen's everything you want to know about sex, .. "and" Funny Games "by Michael Hanneke - The director's obsession with this 10-year-old girl who wants to drink women's milk is quite satisfactory, and when the film climaxed in the "orgasm" where the boy drinks his mother's milk, as well as the milk of the woman he craved for the entire film, I am disgusted by the total deviation and emotional compassion that is. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, and You independent films, so it was supposed to be this I am happy dramatically. Avoid this film at any cost, it must be converted into the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema.
