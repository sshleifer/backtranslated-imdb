I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (many reviews seem to say the same about age 13!) With a group of schoolmates. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film, and we fell into typical commercials that tell us that this is a great comedy. We experienced about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. He was strange and tasteless, and far from Billy Crystal's ability to make us laugh, we did not laugh. I stumbled upon this review by accident and decided to just record it to tell the rest of the world about the waste of this movie, and now if you hired this, then you deserve what you get, I've warned!
