Charley Chase has never found it funny, although his on-screen character reminds me sometimes of John Cleese, whom I find very funny. (Charlie Chase also reminds me of chicken hogs Hen Brown from the Sunday Post cartoon page in Scotland). In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism instead of laughing at him. I will give Chase credit for the fact that his best films - like "Mighty Like a Moose" and "his wedding party" - have inspired Fendum to be very loyal to him ... but I'm sure that even most Chase fans will agree that "marry for" Very early and very simple not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - anxious, embarrassing, fussing, nave - is a young swing hoping Court Rose Fair. Oliver Hardy performs best in this film as her thirsty father, who despises Chase as a "creature". Leo White, who has done a more famous work as a chip for Chaplin in Essonay, is here as a competitor. <br /> <br /> There are some actions that include an hour from Ingersoll. You are fascinated that the brand name is mentioned in the titles of the dialogue: Is this an early example of product development? <br /> <br /> Sadly, there is a big flaw in the "married for" portraying Rosemary Thiapi as a flower: it is supposed to be a source of standard income, but Thiibe - flat plate, and hawk face - is physically mistaken for the role. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) got a successful career as a screen actress, but she was never a reasonable source of revenue. The film historian William K. Iverson is very dismissive in one of his books. <br /> <br /> I will stay "married for" only 3 out of 10, and I am charitable ... because I still suspect that Charlie Chase has got something that everyone else gets, but I'm still missing.
