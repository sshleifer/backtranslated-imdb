I have not seen him in more than twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was a tourist guide, and Lorenzo was the hijacker. <br /> <br /> Because of this, Lorenzo looked a lot at home as a natural villain. I think I saw him at that time more than ever before for OJ, whom I saw Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to watch Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a bit bored that Johnson was very serious. <br /> <br /> Yes, I changed the plots. In reading the other posts, I remember that there was a conspiracy that they would kidnap a rich girl, but then the priceless stamps became blue. <br /> <br /> I was going, and stamped? If it's viewed as a late movie, I'll probably record it to check it again, but I will not be nostalgic. Not yet anyway. <br /> <br /> There are better films than the 1970s to browse.
