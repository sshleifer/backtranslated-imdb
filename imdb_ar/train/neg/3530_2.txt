When Ricci exploded for the first time in a movie scene, his films were welcomed as funny, brilliant, well-directed and innovative. If one can compare the noise he created in his first two attempts, was he supposed to take Richie? Is he really talented? Does he really have any real real ideas? Or is it simply a hummingbird manager who really wants to be a Venture, Tarantino and Lyon all interconnected in a huge and unorganized pile? After seeing the gun can someone be justified to think Was all this wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and complex ideas? The gun tries to be intelligent, philosophical and concise, and tries to be psychologically intelligent, and tries to be complex and complex. Ritchie is making an enormous effort to achieve all these many goals and is investing large parts of the text in existential reflections and many intrigues. However, in the end, all she has to do is to create a highly separated, unorganized and ultimately unfriendly film for the audience. The theft of her literature is so sinful that even though Ritchie tries at least to give her own course, he should be punished for trying to even remove it as a work of his own. So what the public gets at the end is a terrible scenario intertwined with many obvious elements and clumsy tools. <br /> <br /> Revolver is finally a non-original and cute film stolen from countless themes such as Fight Club, Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It aims to achieve high goals, but it certainly portrays a large number of spaces. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be amazing, it's a really poor film masquerading as a wonderful masterpiece of a willing author. However, it falls on his comic face and fails just about everything he wants to have and achieve.
