The opening scenes move smoothly like frozen velvet. Trying to make a dramatic dialogue makes me wish I had better control over fast forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as disgusting, intelligent or mangy creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by mimicking a lost puppy. I usually count a number of people, so there was a cat (countless) bom, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword (all that existed) and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting on an apple for a bloodbath bites a victim is just ridiculous. I liked Warlock, but this movie was so bad that we turned it off and was forgetting that we hired it just a year later to stop it again.
