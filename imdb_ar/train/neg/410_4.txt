Unfortunately, one of the best efforts made so far in the field of special effects has been made utterly meaningless by putting it along with a silly and futile plot, as well as an inadequate cinematic scenario. Hollow Man is a fairly useless film. <br /> <br /> In practice, everything that has been seen here to death - the characters, the idea and the sequence of motion (especially the boom!) - with the only intriguing element in the film is the wonderful special effects. However, it is only the same effect that happens again and again, by the end of the movie that has been done to death too. I had hoped before I could see Hollow Man that the subject of the "hidden man," which is hardly authentic in itself, would be the basis for something new and more interesting. It is not. It was not long before the movie turned into a very familiar bloodbath and a mass of ineffective trichin - the pile of clich√©s accumulates so quickly that it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition, Kevin Bacon does a very useless job, and his support team barely does his best. Good points may be the result of Jerry Goldsmith acceptable (but there is no competition for his best efforts), very interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I have been tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects have pushed "hollow man" to one degree. <br /> <br /> 4/10
