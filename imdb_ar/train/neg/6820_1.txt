This foolish and senseless story is retrieved only through the opening scene in which the SS investigator presents some semi-audible lines that confirm our greatest fear: he died. Perhaps the film could have been saved had the director missed the stunning star of a. Martinez for this sad anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. The possibility that a hacker could get out of the street to save such a film in the wastewater is less likely than the villain who commits a murder by throwing stones at an unscrupulous diver. His moment is short. His promise is enormous. Maybe we will deal with this mysterious time for more screen time if there is ever a sequel to this bad movie.
