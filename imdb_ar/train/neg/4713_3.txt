As you can guess my rating and my review this I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people will say, "How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever seen it?" , I have seen this show several times because I study film and animation and this does not do "raise a candle according to my criteria. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first because it is one of the most confusing things like the first two seasons or the season. I just thought it was a great show to see when it was drawn manually but then it turned into a flash animation and the quality dropped in a huge amount. <br /> <br /> This is a one-shot in my eye but lets look at The story of the show is very difficult to be like a Dexter lab, but there are differences because it is rather a world of t I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean to curse, but I mean I do not know if there is a limit) Everything else despite the spot on, even the character of Johnny Dede himself ... It's very hard to be Dexter, but it seems to me like a heartless launcher. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to talk about jokes. The Lab Dexters Some Jokes involving Screaming? Yes, the yelling can be useful for a joke or two, but the Dexter lab also has malicious notes that made me come back and make sure I get the joke. Johnny forgets to test it all and screams only 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or single liner emerges. This is not a comedy, it's a stupid comedy (I know what some people are thinking, not three stupid comedians - see that and Johnny Test go back and you laugh more at the first option.) Sometimes jokes are based on strange situations that make me feel crazy like Chaudhry. I have a base for comics and comedies all of them: Although many exotic films are not worth comedy, they make you think only "What do I watch?" You do not see this show if you have any respect for comedy in any form, form or form.
