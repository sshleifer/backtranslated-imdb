I read the Jane Eyre novel for the first time in 1986. It was at that time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zilla Clarke. It was an excellent copy and almost a book. Years later, we put our eyes on this version and felt terrified. William Hurt is just as true as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is an emotional figure, portrayed by William Hurt as a mass of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I have not seen it in this version. No, go back to the BBC version. Fantastic time is guaranteed.
