Remember, Josh Kornbluth's "acting" in this film is in the television production classes for new students. The "uncanny" has the opportunity to prove how truly lost they are! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to compare this undulating comedy. Jokes student and programmer. Delivery is very bad. OUCH !!!!!!! The writing is simply dorkish. It is closer to Bob Sajit's show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching Saturday Night Live for an hour and a half (after Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I want to recover my money !!!
