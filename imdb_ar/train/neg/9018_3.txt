This is a science fiction film, not directed by the director. It is about a dragon brought back to life by a scientific team. All that has been done is the things I have seen several times before. It is a weak text, without real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotyped personalities and attitudes. The director attacks this by making it just a movie, without any attempt to deceive us, and this gives the film a light appeal, but it is not something you will likely remember for a while. It is best to see them during cooking, cleaning and exercise. Kind of reckless fun. It has a place in the entertainment, but it's definitely not something you sit down with friends to see it, unless you're drunk and not interested. The overall rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think he's as crazy as most people, but I was surprised that some people in the publications thought it was amazing. This is really elusive, so I do not see any attempt to make this film memorable.
