Oh my God .. The worst thing I've ever seen - this is the main thought that comes to my mind right after watching the movie. I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Still, the idea may have been good but the effect is miserable. I mean in particular Graham's role. what was that??? In my opinion all the positive intentions of the producers were destroyed. Character played in the affected and annoying way. Each time you appear, remember that you are watching a movie and destroying a soul right now, then a full movie because most of the time, you can see its stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create feelings. Awesome, do not waste your time.
