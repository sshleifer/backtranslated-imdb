Really awful ... the actor did not lead OK ... the film, the plot, etc., was crap and was totally inaccurate and probably a good complement ... anything that had nothing to do with Carlitos Way or ... It should be avoided like a plague by any of Carlito's road fans ... No mention of Gil actually, ends up with some other birds, without mentioning Cleanvelt, no mention of how he was arrested, without mentioning how he ended up in prison. .. They tried to make it like the original with the appearance of their appearance in the beginning ... But to be honest in his assessment I was looking for a zero mark ... Unfortunately I had to evaluate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It is a terrible attempt to benefit from It was one of the best movies of the nineties ... Overall it was almost 6 and 2 pounds of my life a waste ... for every "work" in it, it was really boring and predictable ... again for any of the fans of Carltio's Way to avoid this failure ...
