A typical Italian-Western story, a stupid story full of cliches and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punched battles and people who shoot them on a large scale. <br /> <br /> To do with Jango. - At least not in my translated German version, the German version of the DVD is called "Adios Companeros". Macho Calahan fights against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his group (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and split the gang. And your Ironhead is fighting everyone because he's just the biggest idiot and the most greedy anyway. Yes, that's it, no more brilliance in the story of the film, it is. <br /> <br /> There is a small role for Klaus Kinski in the role of Reverend Koten as striking (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men fighting and beating them and shouting "I said love!" In another scene, he won a horse-riding competition and went for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also wonderful that JOE d'AMATO nicknamed Aristide Massaccesi made a movie - I love this profuse inefficient teacher - crush, so it was "aahhh" to me.
