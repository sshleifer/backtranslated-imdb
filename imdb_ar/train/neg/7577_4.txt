This is only fairly catchy for entertainment fans "Bad Movie". The most important thing for pop culture students of 1970: fashions, furniture and attitudes, and the moment of great "hatred of women" in the early seventies, when it was still new and novel for an independent woman working for her own. . <br /> <br /> "Superchick" had a cash reward if it was insulting in the opacity (after all, she is a flight attendant but a 30,000-foot waitress - and that applies to males as well), she grew up Around her with many men, she could protect herself and others (with karate) and were not tied to anything. This is the type of liberated woman who fears the juices of anti-feminist movements, those backward idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. <br /> <br /> The "exciting hostess" was a strong model of the model in the late 1960s and 1970s, (Geez, even on the "family of the hunch," I remember the spinster single Robin Kincaid who is constantly communicating with hostesses). From this point of view, The absurd represents an important capsule for pop culture in pre-AIDS, free love, women's lib, swings the seventies. The plot is extremely awful though. For those caves in the audience, there are a few bare breasts to look at.
