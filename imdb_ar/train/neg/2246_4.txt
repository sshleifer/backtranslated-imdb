I have not seen the original 1954 version of Judy Garland, so I have no way to compare. Also, it has been a few years, but I found this story neither gripping nor captivating romance. The film tells the story of two lovers moving their musical career in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a rock star desperate and disappointed to drop, and start a love story with the new talented new singer, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only confirms his decline. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Chris Christoferson and Barbara Streisand, Cavian in their roles, but did not leave a chemist nor plot too many signs with me. The film is important to me on one side only, which is the beautiful display of Strisand for the Oscar-winning song "Evergreen". It really has a strong and wonderful voice.
