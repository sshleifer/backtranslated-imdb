I started writing this review during a break while watching the movie. This is the first time I have tried to do this, but I have a problem getting past this without interruption. This is not because it is severe but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost boring and unreasonable, especially when the brother Ryan (Colm Fiore) brother deadly was harsh on the screen appears on the screen as a tragic and Petya and Mgamsa himself. -pitying. This was a much better film if they left that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> Nothing but melodrama was added, so disturbing. Perhaps one of them decided that if they could not convince Ryan to believe, they would just make him obnoxious. The problem with this is: who cares if he dies a pampered, anointed, hateful whimper? not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this character is talking about is the fact that he is dying, and regrets, but that is not enough. Death does not make anyone special. We all die, sooner or later. No one is given the right to expect empathy as a jerk. <br /> <br /> Other personal, actors that play a role (David Cobbett in the role of Theo Chandra West in Sarah) role, very much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan interruption of self-pity, would make a movie Much better. But it's not over yet, and it's time to run again. Maybe something great happens before the end .... <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. This tenant turkey is back tonight!
