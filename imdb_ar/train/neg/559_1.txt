I saw this film at the premiere in London, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I expected something that was fun at least moderately. <br /> <br /> The original "original instinct" was not a great movie and still a bit of a "stinky classic" but it was amusing. I can remember countless times flipping through the channels on TV late on Friday or Saturday night after I watched the movie and found myself already beginning to pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this lame mind, waaay-late sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone wonderful? Well, let's put it this way - for the 47-year-old, she's very hot. Are they as beautiful as they were originally? No. She has performed cosmetic surgery on her face, and her hair cut in this film is somewhat unattractive. It does not look as smooth, original or innocent as it was originally - and that's the point of being a sinister seducer, and so on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the shows range from bad to terrible - Michael Katon Jones (a normally safe director - not always doing a great job but running a worthwhile film industry) delivered his first real turkey; it was a very bad movie laughing at moments Certain was supposed to be dangerous. <br /> <br /> I heard that the movie has undergone multiple editing sessions, which is very clear from the beginning. There is nothing logical. The whole plot is a mess and the end - oh my! Talk about stupid and unreasonable. (Still predictable, though). I saw "Gigli" and saw "Son of the Mask" - and although I do not look to "distort" this film, I can say my own power (which you can not do I must agree with anyway, keep in mind) that I The best of these two films on this disastrous failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie began and people began to throw things on the screen during a particularly outrageous scene in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - also spreads mainly.
