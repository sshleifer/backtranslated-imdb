This was a disappointing horror film about a hidden little girl and her nightmares. For a horror movie or "thrill" and noise, it's a very tame way. There are only a few tense moments here, not anywhere as close as a movie of this kind can be. Even those "strained" scenes were not many. The music made them more dramatic as they were already. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of symbolism here, so elite critics have described this movie as a "horror film for a thinker." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion that I did - a waste of money in the video rental shop. <br /> <br /> Summary: Shaggy presents an unlikely leading personality and generally poor acting. Overpriced and certainly not what is advertised.
