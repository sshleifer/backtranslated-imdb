A former naughty pack actor and a pretty boy turns Rob Lowe in a film filmed in a heavily guarded American prison. I had a feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not like that kind of movie, it's like a fugitive runaway man. He also points to the issues of punishment and justice, with James Coburn putting a veil on behalf of the lobbyist for victims of justice, but ignoring any intelligent debate about how the society treats the criminals completely as the film turns into old cliches tired of general shootings and car chases
