I wish I could say that this offer was unusual in its simplicity, but it is common in all ways. He has a stupid husband and his wife is smarter but dull and traditional, along with the angry idiot owner of the "comic" relief he badly needs. The unpredictable and unpredictable jokes, even with the more predictable reactions of the laughtrack, intersect with the lines of malicious doctrinal conspiracy Which can not be imagined, to leave me either in the case of physical illness, or in a deep sleep like an induced coma. But this may last for a while because it gives the average American a really recognizable personality. A "regular" youngster like you and me perfectly. I live in the South of the United States, so this offer to me is just the opposite of escape. Down here, that abhorrent character is everywhere, in one form or another. His vision on television is a wild exaggeration.
