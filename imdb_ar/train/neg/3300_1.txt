Very typical of Swedish films of this kind. Strange that acting was a bad SEO, these actors usually make a good presentation. The casting was done badly, which made you expect something (I will not tell you what). The leading personality was awful ... I do not know where they found her. However, stay away from this and go to "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this is a Swedish procedure.
