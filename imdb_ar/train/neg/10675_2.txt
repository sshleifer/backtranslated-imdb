You should know that when the name of the star is incorrectly listed in the opening credits, it will not be available for a good period (credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some chase the nice car, shoot, go bankrupt if all you want is an act, because the relationship with the plot is weak at best, and not entirely believable. The motivations of the characters, especially Goding's motives in the end, are worse, they are unreasonable, they are irrational when they are not confused hopelessly. All I can think of is that Andy Ching should be a really nice person to get so many good actors in this wrong project (he can not have something in each of them, can he?).
