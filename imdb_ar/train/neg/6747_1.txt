Wow ... Speaking of this film, I can not say too much. I must say that the film box in the local video library is everything ... nothing but 6 actresses / actresses get lost on a group of screaming and decided to shoot a movie! <br /> <br /> It seems that the representation was not budgeted, but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! The elegance of the essence is almost the same here, except that most failures in the acting class forget that there is a conspiracy that needs to go somewhere while reading this text. After only 4 or 5 people have been killed by the masked and plotted assassin who is confused about the murder club that the stupid main actress thinks is a real club she can join (only if you can get past a girl who bumps into her), you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind you never Not to over-thrill with a good movie like this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for people who bought this movie and can not find anyone to take their hands off. Another example of the error in the increasing number of versions of horror direct to the video without thinking about the basics. Throw it away if you purchased this.
