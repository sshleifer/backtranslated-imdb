When I read most of the other comments, I felt they were very glowing for this film. I found that they had completely lost the spark found in the previous Zatoichi movies and just go to prove that after a long absence from the screen, it is often better to leave things. I fully agree with the Star Trek analogy of another reviewer who compared FIRST Star Trek to the original series --- millions of enthusiastic fans were waiting, waiting and waiting for the show to come back and had to watch a nice and sterile display of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is very awesome (although the new Zatoichi movie from Beat Takeshi is much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the original versions. I had no blood at all, but some may be stopped off the path (especially those with cut nose and broken heads). In addition, it was not the right time for Aichi - he seems to be a broken and sad man in this film (much more than usual) - something that series fans may not want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sad return for Zatwichi. Unless you are like me and want to see every movie Zatoichi, this one is very skipable. See one of the earlier versions or 2003 ALL-NEW version.
