Jessica: Ghost Story as the name suggests Ghost Story. The purpose of the subject is to be a horror but come closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A brutally murdered woman comes back from the dead. This is what this movie tries to pass as a plot. There is nothing more really. The film consists of a series of loosely connected scenes that include an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Directly from the opening scenes, this movie shows a "Direct To-DVD" effort. Unlike gems like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity and definitely gives "Direct to DVD" movies a bad name! The trend is as poor as possible with total lack of suspense, fear or tension. Even the elements of drama are dealt with in a desperate way and represent something more boring than the worst soap opera that may have suffered from its misfortune. <br /> <br /> Representation in all areas is very sad with no single representative involved in the management that has even shown the slightest potential for a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long interruptions between dialogue exchanges. I do not exaggerate! <br /> <br /> The only reason to give this movie a rating of 2 instead of 1 is that some poor people are acting with a worse dialogue that was done for a few unintended laughs. I emphasize the word "little" in this sentence. This is not generally "very bad, good" movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch these movies. If you want to watch a horror horror movie, see LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGE, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone with a good fortune to avoid seeing Jessica: a ghost story to keep up the good work! Just forgot this movie exists. Do not spare the idea for it!
