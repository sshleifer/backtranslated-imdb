This is the most ridiculous and funny film I have ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> The plot (little thing here): Clayton Byersford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart is in desperate need of a transplant. Clay was secretly engaged with the Palestinian Authority for his mother, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night that these two men secretly marry, a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. Go and calculate the odds of it! Once discovered at the operating table, Clay discovers that anesthesia does not work, and can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Clay seems to be able to filter the pain of cutting a sharp scalpel into the blade by opening his chest simply by focusing on his memories of Samantha, which we are told to do with an annoying sound that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you do not explode in laughter yet, you will definitely start when you see the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How can a young billionaire approve a heart transplant performed by a single surgeon, a nurse, an attending doctor and an anesthetist? There were more people in the room when the age of wisdom was withdrawn. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is useless to be taken seriously ... The operating room does not remain sterile ... People are practically able to walk inside and outside the room without even washing it .. During the process, the viewer listens to Clay's ideas, Very cool ones. Ah ... but here's what's going on ... Doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. His belief that he is unconscious, and the wicked speak freely. My God! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least, there is no intervention from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor with four misdemeanors is performing a major heart operation. Clay's mother does not seem excessive in the ability to check his condition. The only person interested in keeping the update is Samantha ... but no ... it can be a sweet sam .... You'll quickly discover through the Scooby Doo dialog ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter Whether Clay underwent anesthesia or not, because the end would appear in the same way in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who have fallen victim to anesthesia awareness, there may be some stupid fun in ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
