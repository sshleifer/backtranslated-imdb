With no fault of the actors (they all made great offers), the story was not executed well. The movie begins with a wonderful Zenger: an old crazy man imposes an indigenous girl's car on the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of personal development with a whole new set of characters ... We do not know the reason until the end of forty minutes. It turned out that they were the ones who eventually discovered the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> While the story does not pick up at that point, it does not go anywhere. Two hours later, I asked myself: was there a point in that, or is it just seeing the characters grappling with accusations of racism and stupidity about how they deal with discovery? The story was not satisfactory at the end and I felt it was not over yet. Although it behaves well, there is no strong spine in the film that guarantees its recommendation.
