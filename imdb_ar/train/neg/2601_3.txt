I watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it and I love Drew Barrymore and wanted to watch one of her early movies. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), moving from New York City to Los Angeles to overcome her recent turbulent loss. After a short period of transition to a man falls in love with her, it becomes clear that she has a wicked twin = doppelganger, haunting her. <br /> <br /> The movie is very poor and very poor. Both dialogues and acting make the film not really worth seeing. Summarizing it is just something for fans of Drew Barrymore.
