Way to go Ace! I have just made an awesome and interesting story about cannibal carnivores in a soft tragedy. It is clear that a film called Dahmer would be one of two types: horror, or the correct documentary film? This was not. They were not close to any detailed facts, (in fact did not have any content at all) were not really satisfactory or scary or did not even try to be too worrying (as if you had to experience !!) What the hell was this writer / Director thinks ?? Here is one of the most real examples of the sick sick at all, we get bad repayments, rape by gay mythologists, and the long-haul drones back to time alone in his old parents' house. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) the "soft side" of Jie Damer.
