Based on the positive reviews above, we saw a free offer last night. Now I know that filmmakers are planting positive reviews, because there is no way for an objective individual to write them. "Destined to become a" classic cult ""? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and crew members, because a few of us came out in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Were the songs the most literal I heard in any musical ?? "Do not take the shortcut, honey, there is a wolf in the forest ..". Deby Mazar's eyes fell sharply as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most tunes continued for only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever plays the wolf in this story must be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, formerly of N'Syncer, until he reaches his last name because he did not grow up well. He does not shine very well with his 50-pound living and the start-up quality of high school and high-quality singing. Seriously, was this guy in the acoustic group? The remaining actors are almost sufficient, but they can not do much about the non-fiction script. As you know, is it possible to write for adults and children at the same time? See "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the virtual groups looked great and were well integrated with the actors. The attack was not like "crash."
