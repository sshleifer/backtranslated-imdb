This film tries to re-list the Thai history and is located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it was like many Thai movies that I saw and enjoyed, one of the Thai actors talking about Thai madness and martial arts. Well, none of this. The film was filmed in full English, full of Anglo actors, and has very terrible production values, it's very bad ... but not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? Representation, dialogue and most of the groups were very bad. Some scenes of fighting seemed to have been designed by the drama club of the local high school. The special effects were also often bad, but some were cheap animated graphics on the screen that provided a particularly cheesy effect. It has a great outdoor battle scene in the epic style, where a few thousand additions are run across a field dressed, but when we see the two armies collide in the fight - ha! What a joke! The film does not include two beauty. Unfortunately, they did not show a little more skin. At least, this was something that men deserved. Do not care.
