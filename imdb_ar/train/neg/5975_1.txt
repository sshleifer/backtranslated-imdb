I never wanted to watch this movie, and then one day, to see it, I saw it to see how bad it was; <br /> <br /> For starters, I would like to question the film's policies. They hide behind women's mask "making it big in the city" but the only way women can make it big is by using their sexual lives instead of their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more than whores. Are the less attractive girls not allowed to succeed? This is not the only right-hand message for the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge crowds of money. A good example of how the only strong thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value does not even look at this film. Imagine money as the only thing important to young people. <br /> <br /> The union director states that she does not allow drug abusers in her pub, and then moves on to poor gallons of strong alcoholic beverages. The private neck then necks of its employees and customers. Anyone who knows anything about alcohol will know that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> Finally, why are scenes where the lead character is a sexual point of interest to the audience (when she is taken off or with her boyfriend) does her father always participate? We watch her take off her clothes with the camera and she completely tugs her legs while she is one of her father's phones. She "auctions" her father as she "auctions" her boyfriend. I find this more surprising. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is immoral and Vashy and offensive to women frankly and troubling. But what do you expect from Jerry Brocker?
