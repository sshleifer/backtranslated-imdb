What is the worst film of 2003? "Cat in the Hat?" "Gigli?" MISS NON! I suggest it was this horrible little movie from earlier this year. Badly written, badly edited, (if you are too bold), "The Order" is the black hole of the film - so thick that even the least part of the entertainment can not escape the horizon of the fun event. It's not so funny, like (for example) "Girl Showdown". <br /> <br /> You know that producers assume that their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the film, originally called The Sin Eaters, because they thought the Americans were too stupid to understand what the sinner was, although they did their best to explain what the sinner was in the film. Instead, they represent a completely generic title and a picture of the Heath Ledger that seems dirty enough to bring you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they've been right! My former girlfriend saw Heath's picture and attracted me. Congratulations, producers, met the target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you're in good friendship. <br /> <br /> Back to the subject, Heath plays the role of a Catholic monk from a certain arrangement (guessing) trying to investigate the killing of his teacher. He has problems in celibacy, probably because no one in his right mind was thought to know the slightest thing about religion, and much less to be a monk. The only other member in this application is a fat man who is addicted to alcohol. As much as I wanted to see the funny alcohol return to the big screen, I was reminded of his attempts at humor in all kinds of dogs in my high school that imitated Monty Python, believing that if they just said lines like snake do they would be funny automatically. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I talk anymore, I will be in danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that spoiled this film for me is the fact that it was created.
