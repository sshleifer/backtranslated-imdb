Jay Ritchie's third (without counting "Swept Away") is a complex thriller about gambling and chess. Ritchie's fans are likely to hate the gun as much as I do, with its transformations and turns. Ritchie Jason Statham Richie plays the role of Jake, a former con artist, who goes out to take revenge on the ridiculously Dorothy Macha (Otto Ray Lotta is wonderful) but instead gets involved with two other negatives (one of which is Andre 3000) of the Outkast Rap band They threw us and the audience, a number of red herring throughout the film, all of which became very boring. The top point of this mess of the film is a little in the restaurant, where the dialogue turns down in favor of a wonderful shot, the slow shot of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. All in all, Revolver is a flawless job, not terrible but far from Richie. This will be Lock, Stock. If this movie homework homework homework should be appreciated "must try harder!"
