This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams fits with a single part like a rhinoceros that would suit Tutu, although his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more authoritative but it was still awful. The plot left much to be desired and the rest of the representation was terrible as well. The only thing that was walking this movie was the trailer, which prompted me to waste 90 minutes of my life and it was better to spend it trying to lick the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have. If not, just be happy about it.
