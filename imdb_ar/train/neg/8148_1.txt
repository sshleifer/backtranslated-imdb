Have I missed something here? This adaptation contains all that Brockemer's first novel had. Everything is apart from the story, laughter, black humor, political intrigues, descriptions, plot, and some sort of senses. Beginning to the end. They ridiculed the plot, they had a love story between Parablane and a cop, and what was everything, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a bystander, and who was the supposed hell of Annette Crosby? /> It seemed as if they had adjusted for three hours, then cut it to 90 minutes. (Although 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, please, do not do this any other books for Brookmyres (Private "Blind Country.)
