I've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. I believe that the quality of the movie will be automatically improved only if those songs are canceled. However, things changed quickly after watching this terrible black (no songs) movie, page 3 (lots of songs). Although Black was extremely weak, Page 3 offers an attractive story with some strong behavior and a good direction. The songs were almost accidental and blended smoothly with the film. Certainly, no woman was sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources as she roamed the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the bold and unambiguous approach that the director used. There was nothing shiny, and each scene was almost perfectly reasonable. <br /> <br /> I recommend these movies to people of Hindi speaking with a simple understanding of the life of Mumbai at least. First because the English translation was less than par and contains many errors that, at times, completely reverse the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of photography once you live it yourself. <br /> <br /> Certainly I will classify this as a work that deserves international recognition. The scenes with gossiping drivers were a nice touch, and were simultaneously a source of real humor plus another perspective on the entire Michmash. The film is short in some places though, where characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that detract from the general direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that some of the saddest scenes were not well done. It was an amusing touch to watch, rather than trigger any feelings of sadness, and the entire scene tended to appear foolish. However, these are simple issues, because the film, in general, is really rare to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a cynical, pessimistic and refreshing look at it! Actors, not "heroes" - this is the key. An opportunity to glimpse human beings in an exceptional environment - everyday life. A look behind the scenes over corruption and a rare link of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
