Keeping in mind that John Doe was inspired by the creator of Kyle XY, I expected her pilot to be interesting. However I probably had very high expectations because I was very disappointed because of that. First turn the protagonist into a freak who has a crazy idea of ​​showing his amazing knowledge to an audience in a public area. So after this scene I began to worry about it just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse as no other characters were entered correctly. They focused heavily on John Doe, who made the story less interesting. I was slightly disappointed by the performance of Dominic Purcell because I found that he did not make John Doe. Another problem was the police story. I really felt like déjà vu and it was not an enjoyable feeling. It leads us to the worst problem in the group, casual coordination. I can already see padding coming one by one. <br /> <br /> So, generally I was very disappointed with it and would not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was best to understand now why the offer was canceled. I somehow get the impression that she has failed to achieve her goal, namely developing characters to help the protagonist find his identity. It's sad because there are possibilities, like the people I met at the club. The production quality was very good and cast casting. But I will never know if it has improved, maybe not, because I do not plan to watch the next episode.
