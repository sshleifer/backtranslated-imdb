This movie was the most awesome movie viewing experience I've ever had, and worse, the fact that I had to watch it, I did not have the chance to stop it because it was in school! Admittedly, the film's story was decent ... but I found it was terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean Baptiste, and I think her performance was wonderful. It was the most important thing, and without it, I doubt I would have been able to bear watching the film. Every time I hear someone say "Beloved" I cringe! I almost attacked a client that day because they said "that". It made me remember one of the worst hours and a half in my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if this has offended anyone, I only express my opinion)
