I really liked thriller and science fiction movies in the 1960s and because she was an actress who appeared in it. They found the most attractive women in these films and it was not important if they could act (remember "Candy") why I was disappointed with this film because it was not nostalgic enough. The story here contains a European science fiction film called "Dragonfly" and directed by the director. So the producers decided to let a young ambitious director (Jeremy Davis) complete the picture. She is a real beautiful woman in the film playing the role of dragonfly but barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who exploits some of his fathers from his first days and puts it in the text. I hope the film will be a tribute to those early films. They can have a lot of engraving by the actors who appeared in it. There is one actor in this popular film from the 1960s and Jean-Philippe Barbarella. Gerrard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I will have to continue to wait for the director to pay homage to the 1960s films. If you read this, "Make it as exciting as possible"! I will be waiting for you!
