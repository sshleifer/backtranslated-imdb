"Sky Captain and Tomorrow's World" (amazingly impressive title) is just a bad film; has no heart, no deep thoughts, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is filmed with an annoying soft focus. In addition, the movie uses music the same way you use "Gilligan's Island" or Scooby-Doo comics - it will never stop. Terrible, simply terrible. There are no new ideas, only, gobs, gobs, gobs, etc., from bits taken from old movies and series. There is no gatekeeper here, it seems that the movie exists because it can. Save your money and time. Not amusing at all.
