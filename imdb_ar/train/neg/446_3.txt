This was a disappointment. Things started well enough but over time I lost every opportunity to rise, fell. Maria Schrader's actions are appalling and do not seem to mean what you say, or even know what you say until you say it. She showed no real emotion at all, not for her beloved song, or for her mother's story. When she seemed to Lena more than just an academic interest in Lena's story. There seems to be no real relationship between Lina and her mother except that her mother had a good time at the wedding, and that's not much. The supposed parallels between Hanna's "mixed" love story and her mother's relationship with her father were vulgar when she arrived and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a stupid ending. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena did or did not do to influence the outcome, there would certainly have been some complexity at the time, a haunted look, and an inexplicable contradiction. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to pay attention to any of them, even the small Ruth. Everything was with Lewis distraction. (Why did she tell him that when she was on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation). If every signal is removed, it will not be noticed. <br /> <br /> There is a simple story confused by the poor development of characters (who was his mother, again?) and poor representation, and the direction that made everyone look like they were acting. You almost hear "calm on the group!" I began to think that this is worth 7, but with the continuation of the film, quickly dropped to 4, then gain 3 after the absurdity of the wedding scene. This film was cool and realistic as I saw it. Awesome waste of a good story.
