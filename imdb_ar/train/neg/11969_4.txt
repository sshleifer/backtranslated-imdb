If you want entertainment, do not go to watch this movie. If you want to see war tournaments, do not go to watch this movie. If you want to see a good representation and an excellent script, do not go to watch this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war films that end in time to make a famous political appeal to the public about the greatness of the war and its glory, go to watch this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war films because I think that if they are done well, they can teach us something about the contradictory qualities of war that are worthless. This film depicts a group of men running around the countryside, saying horrible vulgar lines, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same force and brutality as the oppressed. This film is a stain on the film industry and the USA! Can you imagine being a person from Europe, Africa or any other country and watching it, when I tell you that this is really the case of Americans? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, do not waste your time on this unwanted piece; if you must, wait and rent it. 10/04
