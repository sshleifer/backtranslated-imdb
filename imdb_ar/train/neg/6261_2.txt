A couple moves to the house of their dreams, unaware that it was built with neighbors on land previously used as a cemetery. It is said that the film was based on a true story, although it was not revealed in size. The plot is not unique - see Spellberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). Within a short period of time, they face many supernatural phenomena: ranging from the mysterious vague shadows, the serious disease of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous toilets - which flow constantly and the garage doors are out of control. There is little depth to the story: once it has been proved that the land has been used as a cemetery, we learn nothing more. The plot does not seem to evolve. The characters are not painted well or are not memorable in any way nor are the atmosphere particularly special. The movie can be disturbing to some viewers. There is no feeling of venting or any kind of positive messages from it.
