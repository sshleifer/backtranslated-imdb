How sad it is that there is no option to publish a mark less than 1. I saw this piece of nonsense and it was barely true what I was watching. Every part of the film was awful. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, simply everything. I found myself laughing aloud at different points of the film. I particularly liked the fact that our hero was running in the hospital with a slow-moving movement and took the bag out of the nurses' hands, because ............. well. Just because. Product mode? Built in (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian persuader and you are easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you love this movie, then you really need to go out more.
