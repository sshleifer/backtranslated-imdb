Written by Stephen King (written by the king himself) in which a young family, from Reeve-Maine, was introduced to a pet cemetery near their home. Then the father (Del Medkiev) discovers the burial ground of Mikma behind the cemetery of pets with resurrection powers - and of course nothing is buried there to the right. <br /> <br /> Less than a normal "horror" image starts clumsy, insulting, incompetent, and continues this way for a while, with the absolute worst element is the worthless Midkiff performance. The situation is slightly improved in the end, with a really worrying conclusion. In fact, the entire film is really annoying, and for this reason I can not reject it altogether - at least it has something to make it unforgettable. Decent support for the performance of Fred Gwyn, as a wise old neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, where the distorted spirit Victor Pascoe is not enough to truly recover the film. <br /> <br /> King has his usual role as minister. br /> <br /> followed by a sequel by Marie Lambert too (is it strange that she has not been working in the cinema ever since?) <br /> <br /> 4/10
