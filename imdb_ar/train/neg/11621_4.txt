I was interested in watching this film because I knew he was a Christian. The director had a good idea / intention when producing this film, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for those who think he is the greatest love for their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends very insensitive, beggars and rude. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were the ones who meant him. They never understood and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, nor anyone else, did not know whether the previous girlfriend was divorced or still married and so on, but they were against him by solving the old feelings that must be dealt with. His friends were supposed to be Christians and they should have been portrayed as supporters whether they agreed to his decision or not. Often we do things in life, where we do not apologize to those who have been hurt in the past, and when he tried to do so they were all against him. The cynical part was his new friend who accused him of following a stalking behavior just to look for an old friend, when she did something really strange to get his name, address and phone number ... looked like a chase! She did not look like a girlfriend at all but she was looking for herself only. God is love ... I think God wants to have people with the person who was supposed to be with them, and I feel that the film has committed a terrible injustice by making it seem like God does not care about true love ... just this you have to stay with someone you've made an option Bad with. We are all making mistakes ... it's all about the steps you're taking to adjust them. As I said, the film had potential, but I was fed up with a one-sided view that was constantly being repeated and distracting the throat audience from its well-meaning friends. This film did not match the Christian faith with love, but I gave it a C sign for his efforts.
