No, this is not the fairy tale with the pumpkin trainer, the godmother and the glass slippers, but if I explain it, I'll have to spoil it for you, which I will not do. But do not let curiosity give you the best, because this film is not wonderful. It is one of those films that begin preaching, before betraying its audience with tactics of cheap intimidation and incoherent story. This is real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (to Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your nation and your perfect daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is your beautiful and obedient young daughter. The relationship between them is like a hand glove, so you have to think of them as brothers rather than parents and children. But things start wrong (not always) when Hyun-soo's friends, who Yoon-hee worked on, start a frenzy. <br /> <br /> This may be a warning to the masses and to those Korean women who do not attack the eyelid when walking under the knife, if news reports should be believed. The only scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, although somehow I thought that Kim Kee-dook's time had a greater impact when viewing and describing what was happening during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two halves, the fist is an attempt to shock the masses with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, I have received from time to time. However, the second half of the film turned into a reckless mumbo-jumbo, and was very fascinated by his thoughts on your throat. Some things begin to be unconscious, and while attempts are always made to clarify, you probably will not buy them, not that horror movies make sense to begin. <br /> <br /> The evidence is all beautiful, and there is a clear lack of male presence besides the police role that is negligible. But hey, I do not complain, although it was possible to greatly improve the story. I recommend you watch this, only if you are a fan of the average Korean horror, on the VCD. Watch out for those moments you face!
