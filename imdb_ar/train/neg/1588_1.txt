This was the worst film I have ever seen Billy Zan. I understand that this film was the basis for the new films, which were a good success for beginners, but on the whole, the film was not reasonable. <br /> <br /> With each shot, you think the police may enter. Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid. The way Shawn suddenly realized the currency was mistakes, was not realistic. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been slapped quickly. Bad post. Get the best writer. <br /> <br /> The countdown to the end was not in sync with anything. It took longer to fight. And it's a coincidence that every time Billy was going to explode Shawn, he would be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's personality was awkward. It was very stupid when Sean finally balked. It was like comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
