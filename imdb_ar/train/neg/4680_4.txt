If asked how I can define the word "shallow" I will answer "watch the production of Jerry Brookheimer". If asked how I can identify the phrase "potential lost" I will answer "watch the production of Jerry Brookheimer." Bruckheimer's productions are always sure of fire at the box office, but they always receive critical fluctuations from critics. From the top of my head, I can only think of one of the officers, Neemons and Black Hawks who got a lot of critical praise. <br /> <br /> Crimson Tide has also received some critical accolades from critics, it's certainly one of Brookhammer's best films which unfortunately does not say much. My problem is the scenario: the Russians are fighting Chechnya and the conflict is spreading all over Russia, leading to a radical Russian nationalist taking over a nuclear missile base and threatening the West if they intervene. The end of the Cold War may have been connected to it but found that this group is not very convincing. This does not help with some geographical mistakes, such as the French transport company Fuchs in the Mediterranean (why is Fouch better in the Black Sea?) Or that the news bulletin is composed of family shots showing conflicts from the Balkans, the first Gulf War to Vietnam. Once again I slipped into a "very unconvincing" character to my mind. The story is somewhat improved when the story begins correctly - the battle of wills over orders between the commander of the nuclear submarine and his second number. Director Tony Scott is doing his best, as the actors do, but the problem remains in an unconvincing scenario. The worst of it is that if this happened in the mid-1980s when World War III was a real possibility - not a possibility - this movie would scare me, but after the end of the Cold War, the risks of nuclear war meant that CRIMSON TIDE had little effect.
