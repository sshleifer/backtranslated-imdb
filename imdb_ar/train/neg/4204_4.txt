David Arquette is a young and naive security alert for the homeland. <br /> <br /> A salesman was captured under the Stanley Tucci wing. Arquette is a golden boy <br /> <br />, where he made great sales in his first call - to widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her son, the duke Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well <br /> <br /> Well for Arquette, he appears in commercials for security <br /> <br /> He is in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and the woman of his right hand allowed Mary McCormack to enter there <br /> <br /> with little secrecy - sometimes breaking into the homes of their clients <br /> <br /> In order to intimidate them and get their neighbors customers to buy <br /> <br /> Security systems from the company. Arquette decides not to get involved <br /> <br />, taking Capshaw to meet his family, and doing life <br /> <br /> with a vague smile on his face. After that, someone breaks into Capshaw's home and kills her and her son. Arkit is suspected in Tochi and puts a series of traps, leading to arming his head <br /> <br /> While Tucci pleads for his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on the play, "The Alarm Clock" does not open well. The viewer is played <br /> <br /> where Arquette Capshaw takes to interview his parents <br /> <br /> badly and completely unfamiliar. She is also out of line <br /> <br /> with the character played by Capshaw, where she is drunk and tells <br /> <br /> explicit sexual stories of Arquette's mother from Michael Learned. Unlike <br /> <br /> of these scenes, Capshaw has not been given much to do, but it <br /> <br /> does a lot with the little that you have provided. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, who looks just like Terry O'Quinn, is a riot like the security company owner <br /> <br />. It is a creep that does not really understand <br /> <br /> Arkit rebellion. However, when he turns to <br /> <br /> floundering after Arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been set up to play a larger role, but <br /> <br /> often stands and agrees with Tooshi. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> Too old to play stupid, but funny, especially <br /> <br /> tells his explicit sexual story to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script runs from romantic comedy to dark comedy. <br /> <br /> Soon. Capshaw to meet the parents is not quite excited, <br /> <br /> except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can <br /> <br /> storm her house. Capshaw and Reynolds are only present in the film <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to retaliate against Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proved to be a good actor, is appalling here. <br /> <br /> The constipation-controlled seizures that brought him to those ads <br /> <br /> AT & T, and he is not present strong enough to build this weak film. In fact, Reynolds may have been a better choice in the role. <br /> <br /> The direction of Dunsky is good, nothing will win the Academy Award soon. <br /> <br /> Christoph Beck's record of the film that this film tries to make is very appealing. <br /> <br /> Despite the pros, Arquette's failure to lead the race and the quality of schizophrenia <br /> <br /> has led to the separation of the film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This (R) is categorized as physical violence, gun violence and some unfairness, strong virulence, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual sex <br /> < References, adult cases.
