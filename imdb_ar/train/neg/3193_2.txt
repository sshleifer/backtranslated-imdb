I can count on (on the one hand) the number of good films starring Joe Don Becker. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Endless chase scenes, fuzzy dialogue and terrible crashes in continuity have made this movie an excellent choice to get broadcast on MST3K. <br /> <br /> This is the only way I've been able to see this ...
