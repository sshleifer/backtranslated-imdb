This film was filmed directly with the rewording of the famous novel Conan Doyle's "The Lost World" of 1992. It shows. <br /> <br /> The film begins with enough awareness, as a merciless organization intends to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go down. Everyone is stranded on a plateau and we left with a weak, boring rework, the length of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (hardly seen at all) are just funny. Are you expected to take this beloved game that is supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? The dinosaur appears to derive its roots from its place. <br /> <br /> Make yourself known and get the 1925 silent version of the lost world. Unbelievably in the CGI era and other advanced influences, the 1920s version is the best and will remain so until someone decides to make a decent restructuring.
