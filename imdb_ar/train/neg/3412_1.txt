First, IFC is managing Town and Country, and now this. The difference between this stink and this pink tiger is that the city and the country were opposite. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the actors took part in this so that they could come out in Europe at the expense of someone else. Belushi is particularly troublesome. His sight with Candy (doing a Z-class Z-grade) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes from Shepherd undisputedly, I bet that prisoners in Gitmo will clash like a nut! <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (as well as being green) is Shepherd: mousy, the wife who takes Monte Carlo Casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, gotta some oceanfront properties in Arizona you might be interested in!
