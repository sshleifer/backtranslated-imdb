I refused to see this when it was originally broadcast, and I cherish the memory of the late 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cobb, but I can never resist the challenge. They should know better. This was not just a remake, more of a spoof than a salute, this show was not quite know how to play it, filled with childish comedy, intrigues and cartoon characters. The three main characters were a little more than the cartoon of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is distressing in a straight role). The supporting cast was just an acquaintance of Comedians who wanted to be part of the joke, and they were fully aware of the situation that was not convincing. Although the effects of CGI can not help improve those available 30 years ago, they dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to hide the poor quality of texts and dialogue. Each style and any material. (While the 1960s was a mockery for being too much of his time, this "modernization" has become very dated, characterized by matrix costumes and compulsory "girl power" scenes, and less subtle tension between living leads.)
