I should not watch this movie. The technique may be considered artistic for some, but it is one of the factors that causes migraines for me. I think maybe she had an interesting scheme, but since I could not see him for long periods of time I missed a lot. Pictures of flickering and stopping motion photography described my mind. I stopped looking halfway and will not go back for the second try. I suppose I was at home alone in a dark and stormy evening lighthouse. It might be just a ticket ... Note: I'm not sure whether something like the lighthouse / film can be considered corrupt, but I do not want to be blacklisted in my first assessment;
