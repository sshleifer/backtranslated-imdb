I'm the kind who went to the local library and read the books on the Babbage engine in the teams while my schoolmates were playing football and so on. So, if there's anything like the target audience for this film, I think I'm likely to be included in it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to see it again. One of the previous reviewers said that the film was not seen while tired. Maybe that was my fault. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that I like, but in general I found it to be completely amateurish and totally unstable. <br /> <br /> To be somewhat nerd on a computer that I self-recognize, I can not but touch the exact timeframe when the film was actually produced, and how the graphics used at that time reflect (ie, 1997). After playing the games c.f. "Mind Grind" To refer to one example, this movie can not escape the 16-bit low-resolution multimedia explosion at the time. Fortunately, this has decreased somewhat in recent years in the gaming world at least, in favor of actual play. <br /> <br /> Having to watch this movie via a German FTA satellite channel (as I do not do) I think it was aired on FTA in the UK, and it has not been broadcasted anyway), I was enjoying To see the final points. Note that Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on its design. This may mean that I'm excited to be happy with this, since 10 years have passed since the film was made, but the end result makes film graphics from the 1980s look good compared. <br /> <br /> But, as for the main story, I agree that coordination is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a film without a science fiction angle, and perhaps the most obvious biography approach is more appropriate to cover the story of this wonderful lady's life. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental errors that have undermined my enjoyment of this movie. First of all, the basic idea that somehow missing real world information from the past can be carefully reconstructed through some kind of induction through clever agents based on programs seems somewhat ironic. <br /> <br /> Also, the idea that works through a film that a computer can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (like wind) is now known to be not. <br /> <br /> Well, so the Victorians may have taken this view, but the work of the 20th century proves that no mathematical system can be completed. Turing's work around the limits of computation, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, These ideas have all been completely undermined, which seems to be fundamental to how modern day researchers are supposed to operate the program. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air to mean "programming" is also a wrong error, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This film may have been OK, but at least some of the scientific consultation has not given the film some of the much needed balance in the credibility quotas. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the film though, like "Pi", it's obviously a unique work, but also many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy, 3/10 of me.
