Words betray me, words betray me. It was very hard to watch this film, and then I wish I had not done so. Although I tried to sit in it until the end of the credits, I have to admit that I can not hold for more than an hour, so my opinion may be unfair. However, this film will require the last third most impressive in the history of filmmaking in order to get a review is nothing but a sinister thing. <br /> <br /> Please do not see any part of this movie.
