On Christmas Eve, I make my children take another offer for a wonderful life. I totally enjoyed the Santa Fe. So sue me. I admit it. I love cheesy movies, schmaltzy. I love excellent and very smart, but as with so many things, diversity is a good thing. What will be the Christmas season without Ka Qing Ching's annual film in Santa in all its manifestations, from Edmund Gwyn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not make anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I do not think the Christmas movie should reach its famous place to succeed. "Fred" is a great holiday movie, where enough humor for adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was clear and Vince Vince was. Paul Giamati was Santa's top, which helped a lot. It is not a big flick and is not likely to become an annual Christmas display for anyone. But my wife and daughter enjoyed it for what it was, a schmaltz holiday with a small dash of spice. Theres a critical in it.
