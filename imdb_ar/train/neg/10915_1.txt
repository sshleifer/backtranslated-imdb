I think that war films should try to convey the horror of war, avoid the idealism and respect some primitive military principles. Zvezda barely does the first. Since Zvezda is a Russian war movie, I was expecting patriotism, passion, beautiful poetic images, lush result, Slav cheekbones and harsh Germans. What I did not need was the naive love that had nothing to do with it, the unrealistic absurd scenes of war and the misuse of soundtracks in a film carefully avoiding all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism and the Holocaust), yet an insult to our sense of history attached to the "liberation of Poland." A missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda.
