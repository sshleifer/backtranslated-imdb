When I was a kid, I and my friends thought that Gymkata was the most violent movie ever. I'm not sure who started the rumors. Perhaps because of the frustration of children aged 10 years who were not allowed to see him for one reason or another. Years after the release of Gymkata, a cable film became a late-night cable and, as a result, compensated for lost time. I have to see scenes of this awful excuse for a movie over a dozen times, and I can always watch it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, apart from the forced coupling between gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, harsh dialogue, the story is very difficult story, the film contains some things. With all that is bad about the film visually, the sound is really fun. Never before have you landed a punch or kick with a little power and lots of sound! The canned kung fu sounds are cheeky, but the slow and misleading music, the slow motion scene that takes about 5 minutes is really strange. The chase in the city of bloodthirsty villagers is not as tense as it is annoying, and there are enough wigs and bad additions that all look at the camera and the wave to make the train wreck a bit of fun. Could you be heading towards putting classic worship? Where is MST3K when we need it?
