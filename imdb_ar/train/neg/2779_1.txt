It is clear that when the representative makes enough money he will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he got should go to his fans as an apology for his association with ROTTEN. The special effects were worse then the effects of the fifties B films and the representation of the rest of the actors was worse. As far as the extent of misbehavior, the child gave the second best performance in my opinion. English was terribly moving, and I think no one can actually speak English. They just saved how words look instead of memorizing the text and trying to make their characters "life-like" and realistic.
