"Sleeping with the enemy" is a predictable film, "There Was Before" and does not seem to find any inspiration no matter how desperate and desperate the crew is. I can not believe that a handful of my friends talked to me to see this in movies about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of authenticity from the Ronald Bass scenario (based on Nancy Price's novel) does not help, neither the old direction of Joseph Rubin or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. The support team including Patrick Bergen and Kevin Anderson do little to help. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be said. Just give it a miss. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - The Hoyts Cinema Center in Melbourne
