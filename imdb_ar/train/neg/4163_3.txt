I see where a few people involved in this disaster wrote comments to share their side of the story, and I thought that what they wrote was useful in understanding it. The fact that they have basically reached excuses - rewriting, budget constraints, production formulas, etc. - simply confirms how bad this film is. My criticisms of collection are not personally directed, but just a warning that this warning does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It's viewable, but barely so. There are plot holes in each corner, borders on ridiculous boundaries, and the end is telegraph at a mile. Sinking an interestingly modest feature of a three-dimensional image interacting with a team re-dialogue in a silly like that makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Do we have some Hamburger Hilper Sally, among us killed by the vacuum cleaner? This elite team appears to be equipped with the latest tools and circular tools made of red plastic tubes that can not access MRE programs. Once in the last rooms, they treat the place as a four-star hotel rather than a killer area. <br /> <br /> The rationale for meeting a fearsome rocker is that you can not kill him alone. So far, only one scene, the hero who left the case gave up the king to do just that. Hey? Vivian Wu was attractive and highlight the best actress in the film. But that does not say much.
