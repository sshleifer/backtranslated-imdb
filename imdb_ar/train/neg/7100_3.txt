This film begins promising and then becomes very confused and confused. Kamal Hassan made a lot of effort to make the period look correct, and unfortunately he did not spend much longer in the plot. Most small characters appear in the film for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
