Night Prom: The most important night for any shallow girl is made up entirely of plastic. So the characters continued to remind us every ten minutes when some minor events occurred in their small lives. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for Prom Night. There is nothing original about it, and I really gave it zero stars or less if possible on IMDb. The only part of my show that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers who were sitting in front of us decided to practice the game of "ghosts". It was more exciting than anything on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a man in a state of agitation. The thing was, it was not even a bit of a thrill. Maybe if the guy was scary remotely instead of taming Robbie Williams like a baseball cap, maybe I'd sit there to be a little worried. The fact that my interest in characters is less than the color of the film carpet did not add to the effect. To make matters worse, the rest of the characters on the same footing were one-sided and ignorant. It seems that the hotel staff did not notice or care that one of their maids had disappeared and they were further proof that the killer was not recognizable after having received a haircut. I was incredibly surprised that the typical and seductive girl in the blue dress was the only person who noticed who he was. She realizes that, then starts down the stairs, snaps herself into a plastic sheet and then knocks a pile of paint buckets. Nice one. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that I believed the director was trying his best. It has been pushed to the limit by not showing any killing that actually happens. shocking! Music, so do not make me started. It was almost as good as being stripped at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really wish the night concert would be a joke. It was terrible and unpredictably stupid. No one, in their right minds or otherwise, has no reason to see this film. It seems that mainstream cinema is going downhill, and films like this are exacerbating the situation. If you want to watch this terrible movie, listen to my appeal. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a paper to play ghosts with.
