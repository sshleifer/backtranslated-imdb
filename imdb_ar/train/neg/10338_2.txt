This movie is completely stupid. <br /> <br /> From Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to its climax, the film is an exercise in predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the real fiction sociopaths detective. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who have assembled the pieces to solve the puzzle, Hammer breaks things to get to the truth. This film turns the "hammer" into a boon surrounded by bad guys who ... well, very stupid to stay away from anything. One is so weak that he succumbed to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> There are other parts of the movie outside the Three Stooges playbook. Velda dance in the bar, for example, or bad guy who accidentally stabbed the boss in the back. Breaking the continuity is shameful: Frau Blucher is walking in the middle of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but is on her way to the side when she pulls the camera back to get a bigger shot. Worse yet, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy chasing Hammer passes seconds after our hero, after the clock showed he was seven minutes late for our man. Is so bad that he should be seen, which is the only reason why he got two points out of 10.
