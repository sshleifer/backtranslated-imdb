What is this nonsense? My little cousin chose this clearly for art and my girl DVD title too ... I decided to watch it with her so she did not feel bored, and I certainly felt terrified of the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They seem like amateur actresses reading from cue cards. Seminal delivery is very equivalent. The scene cuts were awful .. They seem to have taken the thing directly from the storyboard, if there is one. <br /> <br /> Second, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or played well at all - again, very formal. I can not count how many times I've been able to predict the next joke. I got a number of mischievous laughs from the "subtle" sexual innuendo. Cat, Beaver Patch, Hong Wong? .. Come on! Just .. Stay away from this movie. It's not nice, it's not funny, it's not even stupid. It's just stupid. It's like PG kids with non-vulgar sexual cues, vulgarity and violence to go beyond the MPAA rating. Stay away. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they're calling now?" <br /> <br /> "You can ride my pumpkin." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I was stained with blood on my stool!" <br /> <br /> I played hard, sir.
