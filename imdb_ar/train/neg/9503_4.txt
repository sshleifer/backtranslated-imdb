This chaotic film <br /> <br />, also known as House of Exorcism, is so seriously known that it kills any value for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The plot includes the European tourist Elke Sommer who has the opportunity <br /> <br /> to compete with the Tally Savalas, which is exactly like the devil you saw <br /> <br /> In a mural in Medan . Somer is given a ride to a mysterious house <br /> <br /> in the country, where Svales is likely to be a servant. There is a mistake for a dead woman for a long time, and the real soap opera begins. <br /> <br />. The motherly husband at home had an affair with the dead woman, who was the fiancee of the mother's son. The couple who gave Sumer the ride? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the driver, uh, "the back seat leads <br /> <br /> lessons," and the husband knows and does not care. In the end, <br /> <br /> most of the crew were killed, Sumer is raped and raped, <br /> <br />, and the viewer is transported to its peak on an empty ship <br /> < The plane ... which must resemble empty theaters is this thing <br /> <br /> in which you played. <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this "House Exorcism" has scenes <br /> <br /> with the participation of a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS version of this version, from Elite Entertainment, is quite clear and <br /> <br /> packed in boxes. There are "extras" after the end of credits; deleted sex <br /> <br /> and gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his scenarios are very bad. There are half the baked ideas, the abandoned charts, and the amazing amenities that do nothing but push this thing forward in a kind of direction. You have a life like puppets for <br /> <br /> The funeral ceremony, the blind husband does not blindly do all this, <br /> <br /> Savalas is given the same popsicles he had in "Kojak," ( Who are you?)? <br /> <br /> It appears that the project had two names of stars, and then wrote the script <br /> <br /> quickly, something that happens in Hollywood everyday <br /> <br /> Happening now. Savalis seems completely lost, with his lines <br /> <br /> paused, wishing his character did not die in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen." Somer wanders and screams and giggles a lot, but her character is empty, and I use the term "personality" loosely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a real weird movie, and your reaction to it may depend on how powerful you were in Eurohorror, and Kojak. I am for one person who can not <br /> <br /> recomment "Lisa and Satan". <br /> <br /> This is uncategorized, including all additions at the end of the VHS <br /> <br /> Copy, containing strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> Gore, Strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and adult attitudes <br /> <br />
