I was very disappointed with this film. I thought the "scary movie" although it was not a great film was good and very funny. On the other hand, "Scary Movie 2" was boring, not funny, and sometimes stupid. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / Amityville may have been the best part of the movie. James Woods was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, I will admit that I am in a disadvantage because I did not watch some of the films that these films have made in contrast to the first, where I basically saw them. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> There was something truly painful about this film - the timing that destroyed some of what might be good jokes. Drag the viewer and jokes the long way. <br /> <br /> Also, the same jokes are repeated over and over again. For example, the modern bird. Well it was funny and maybe the second time. But he continued to get repetitive to an alarming degree. The routine between the wheelchair man and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but he continued to repeat and ended up being stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Even some jokes have been repeated even in the first film. For example, the 'creaming' I think you call Cindy (Anna Fares) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been giving her a sexual friend for a long time, and he had blue balls from hell that was funny when he "honored" him. But this time it was out of place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor were generally more enjoyable and a good time for the first time. The extravagant humor was excessive even though it was unnecessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and I had no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed a little. Wayans) who was in my opinion the most personal character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot factory was one of my favorites in the second film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me, I love the Wayans family and the humor. That's why this movie is very disappointing. . . They have a much more comic ability than endless jokes.
