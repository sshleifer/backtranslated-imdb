Yes, in 35 years of film work, I finally saw stinking that outweighed all the other horrific movies I've seen. "Good faith fishing" hit Pais Moi and "Flirt" because of the terrible horror. This is a pretentious pretentious first-class ... not even as a buzz entertainment. The effects are cheap, and worse - to no avail. <br /> <br /> It seems that the script written by a filmmaker in the first year did not come out very much but he wants to appear tired! Representation is simply too bad - Tilda Swinton goes beyond a career full of viciousness with a performance that veers nervously between "adversity" and "ridiculousness." Apparently, some fools allowed the director of this film to make another film ... it must be warned
