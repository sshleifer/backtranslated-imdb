It's hard to believe that the animated Jet Li film could be very boring, but it was a sequel. The plot is a mix of other Chopsuke spells in Hong Kong. The work of martial arts is all special effects and not human talent. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a comic book about a group of super soldiers who will be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Lee) who is reluctant to have an incompetent army to save them and rebuild a peaceful library. The savage killers float on the backdrop of a high-quality conspiracy by Austin Powers to take over the world, and Lee gives up his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was named, which may have been amplified by the subtle conspiracy and comedic effects of 25 Cent. But I think even the 8-year-olds who were watching ninja turtles had found this event hollow.
