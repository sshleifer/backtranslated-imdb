Veteran footballer Bruno Matte appeared again with this sensational thrill that clearly reflects Joel Schumacher's 8mm. But, as expected, Mattei is making his film on a limited budget - so it seems really vague when it's released. <br /> <br /> After her daughter is kidnapped, the mother enters a dark world of underground pornography because the hijackers belong to an international organization that directs snape films as long as exclusive clients receive good salaries. The search for her daughter not only leads the mother throughout Europe, but also leads to prostitution. Go to bed with some men to get her clues. When they finally arrive at the Palm organization led by the mysterious doctor Hades, they are at great risk to themselves. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good to say about it, even though it starts with promise. The problem is that the film is not as thin or blunt as one would expect from a director who made films like Blade VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) Is not good enough and does not contain the amount of nudity and sex to keep the viewer's attention really. The plot is not too special, except perhaps in many surprisingly different locations throughout Europe. The end is very disappointing. The acting is also not great, except for Anita Oyer, who plays Doctor Hadis: She acts and behaves in a very frightening way. You do not want to meet her like this in a dark alley (or your bedroom, for that matter). <br /> <br /> In general, SNUFF TRAP appeals to Bruno Mattei film collectors only. But it's good to see the man again on the helm: it was his first thriller since 1994 giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
