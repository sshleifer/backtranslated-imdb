This movie is not worth the next few minutes that I will spend criticizing, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help decide on movies. For this reason alone, I write this. <br /> <br /> "Live Broadcast" is similar to the Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (also known as "blood-sucking whims") (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247). Torture, chipping, killing, cannibalism ... Sure, everything is here with a third-class text, pathetic representation, and oblique failure to try in black comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie happens in China, but everyone speaks English. There are plenty of girls in the movie who are horrified by the slaughter of dogs on the market, but are sexually excited to enter a porn salon. There is still one girl who is disgusted by the filth in the bathroom stall moments later with her boyfriend (how he got so that there might be the only attractive thing about this entire movie.) The movie is absolutely terrifying, even for the movie B. Even if you download it for free, it will be an insult to your hard drive.
