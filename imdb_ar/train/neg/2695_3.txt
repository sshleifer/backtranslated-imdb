When I go out to the video store to rent a click, I usually trust IMDb views on a movie, and until this time, I've never seen a click rated 7.0 or higher on a site I did not enjoy. <br /> <br /> Sydney Lumitt, the legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, is really misunderstood by committing one of the biggest mistakes the director can make: filling a movie with completely unpopular characters without any real redeemable features on Absolutely. <br /> <br /> I love films with flawed characters, but regardless of how dark they are, we all have a little light too. We are all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lomitt crossed this line by filling this film with almost unfavorable black figures and masochia. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawk Hank is 30 years old, a sleepy, immature, irresponsible man, divorced from a marriage with a wife she hates and a daughter she believes is a loser, a freak. His unwillingness and desire to let others do this dirty work for him because he is so cowardly to do so leads directly to the collapse of the bank robbery plan and the murder of the mother. While standing in front of his older brother at the end of the film, it is more pathetic than the Renaissance. Ethan Hawk plays his character well, but does not give much work because he is portrayed as someone who has a box always sealed on his face and does not care about its existence. <br /> <br /> Talking about the wife of his character is just as bad. Almost every single shot of the film you are visiting is his verbal scolding for rent and child support expenses and more reassurance in his self-esteem that did not already exist with insults. Seriously, this is just about every character does. The limits of her harsh behavior are like hatred. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays the role of his father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for decades, he spends about 90% of the film with the same mouth. Open half of the gloom on his face like he is suffering from the worst fit of constipation in the world. For someone who has been a representative for as long as Mr. Finney, you think he will be more receptive. Although he does not show much, his personality is supposed to be sad and full of anger. When Andy quits at the end of the film, it is like Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create because of her misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tome does not give much to her character. He is stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and has an affair with his brother for an inexplicable reason. When the Andy world starts to get out of control, the boat jumps logically, but in fact does not make it less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but perhaps the most sensitive person at least. Finally we got to Andy, who played well Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason to classify this film on 3 instead of 1. His performance of the heroin-financier CEO who devoured the "perfect crime" of stealing a shop His father's insured jewelry runs out. His descent from a quiet master plan from a flawed scheme to the unruly and misguided freak of murder is reasonable and tragic. Hoffman's character ends up becoming the main villain of the film, but it is hard to fight against him in view of the alternatives, the emotionally reserved younger brother and the father who admitted that the weak mother's early birth led to his son's ultimate psychosis and the unintentional murder of his mother. . <br /> <br /> In the end, this film deserves to see the impressive performance of the PSH and the nature of the wreckage of the family train. Just do not expect there to be anyone worth cheering because there are no personalities.
