I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes several times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy De Williams, Jeff Konaoui, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scugens - all of them have some talent but they all add up to a skin-like click of Cinemax put on a spaceship! <br /> <br /> It is sad that the Alien Intruder is unique, with a foreign computer virus / harpy / and anything else you would like to call the Ariel (Scoggins) sneak into this high-tech virtual reality station On board a spaceship that allows four men to step out of their imaginations as Captain Williams is seen by the system dramatically. <br /> <br /> Are you interested? Maybe, but here everything plays just like a well padded loop of the Red Diary Boot. Williams beats everything right and left, and seems to prefer to do anything else, anywhere else. Ah, the things people do for money .... <br /> <br /> The forex market is fairly stable and probably less than you would expect in a cheap video game like this. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you'd expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here, and of course, it gets the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you love a movie that is completely surrounded and has no brains, check out "Alien Intruder". Of course, you probably will not have to look beyond the Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> There are no stars, not even the power of the stars that this can exploit. <br /> <br /> Leave this missing space.
