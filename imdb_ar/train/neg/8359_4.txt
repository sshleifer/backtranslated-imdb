Despite some moments under heavy rain, a confrontation with a drunken mill with gypsies and monkeys, and a stay at the sanatorium, Rosco's "Fatty" Karakal comedy offers silent silent support from Buster Keaton and Al St. John is appropriately amused only though there is a very funny sequence of Arbuckle's flirting with Buster and this is ultimately the "cute meet" scenes especially since it's the few times we see The Great Stone Face smiling and laughing in the movies! Also, it seems that many of the scenes have been edited due to perhaps excessive use of stock footage. However, if you are a supplement to Arps or Keaton, Good Night, Nurse! It is definitely worth a look.
