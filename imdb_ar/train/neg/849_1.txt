One Star. That's all that this documentary deserves. I did not feel so disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, sometime. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the series "Walking With ...", including the Marvin Nigel spin-off, despite all their fun of informative information yet. Although the subject of prehistoric man has never cared about me as much as other prehistoric creatures, it is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other documents from the series, I figured I needed to see this too, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Well for those of you who have put a good review of this document ... What are you thinking ?! Lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they were able to access was interesting, the presentation failed in all other possible ways. He had a terrible flow, was incredibly centerless in what he was trying to say (with blended information and sometimes out of place), terrible effects (including a few moments of CGI and especially make-up effects) and excessive use of MTV's camera effects. <br /> <br /> When talking about the effects of make-up, one of the reviewers here mentioned how much laughter the scene had when the cave men confronted this giant monkey and what it looked like a horror film in the seventies. . Well, there are a lot of moments when people who picture the monkeys seemed silly and cynical. None of this is supported by horrible camera locations and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is not showing any of them in an interesting, dynamic, or real-time way. It does not seem to have been taken seriously. She also lacked any emotional punch that her predecessors had. Remember the episode in "Walking with the Dinosaurs" of the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?)? This episode still makes me close to crying every time I see it. This kind of connection to the subject that we lack here more than anything else. When you are more involved in the subject and have a personal story of their own, even those that are just speculation, you are more interested in the facts surrounding it. <br /> <br /> The only graces that provide this production is fairly good narrative (at least in the BBC version I've seen) and music. Other than that, do not even bother hiring this person unless you want to laugh well (which I've done a lot, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong to the shelf with other "Walking With ..." documents. <br /> <br /> Is it logical to know that this document was not produced or shared directly with the same people who made others in the series? Hmmm ...
