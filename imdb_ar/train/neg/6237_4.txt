The statistics in this film have been well researched. No doubt about this! Al Gore certainly presents his case well and it is no wonder that this film has earned the praise it has received. Al Gore is definitely a representative. Seems very worried. But the verbs verbs of words! During this film, there are political tricks and references to his political life scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who speaks not only of speech but walks as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he refused thermostat in the White House and warmed up wearing a jacket. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we have to maintain the energy and the claims that we are creating global warming while walking on his own plane. How much energy does his aircraft use and how much pollution does his aircraft cause? How much energy is needed to heat the Gore pool behind his palace? It would be great if we could save electricity with small devices and make it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we do, the energy company will react with a 50% reduction in energy by describing it as a "50% loss of revenue" and recovering its losses by raising rates by 50%. So, "turning it off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hidden appeal to allow the Big Goivernment to control everything, in the name of saving the planet, ie.
