what happened? What we have here is basically a strong and reasonable hypothesis with a decent and talented crew, but somewhere the film loses. In fact, it did not happen already. There was a little excitement when we discovered that Angie was not already pregnant and then discovered it in the end, but that was it. Steve Martin, a very talented person who usually brings a lot to the film, was terrifying and his entire personality was not close to being important to this film, other than making it longer. I really wanted to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe I did not try pure comedy, which was not with regret, but perhaps a drama with comic elements. I think that if the film did this, it would be very funny because both actors are funny in their own way, and sitting here I can think of many scenarios that could have been riots.
