This melodramatic Bollywood film has become a favorite of Western critics. Scenario is ridiculous, the representation is over the top, looks cheesy. The only reasons to watch this soap opera are the wonderful songs sang by Mangeshkar and the legendary curtain call Mina Kumari. Watching the actress, who was sick during filming and will drink herself to death at the age of forty shortly after the film, has the same fascination as watching the train wreck. Her former husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacked the competence to carry out any task well. Bollywood produced much better movies.
