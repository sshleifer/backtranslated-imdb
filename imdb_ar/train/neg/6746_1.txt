With a title like "Bleed", you know that creative juices did not work much when this puppy was designed. This film is the main low budget film run by the company. Sure, he's trying to be creative with the "killing club" hypothesis, but we learned that it was just a joke anyway. Well, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in town starts dating her co-worker. He invites her to his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a "killing club" and kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we knew it was just a joke, but not before you killed a lady heroine in a garage. Now, the "members" of the killing club are killed one by one. Oh, win the bad guys and the movie ends on Downer. By that time, you will not be really interested. <br /> <br /> Looking back on the past, the first ten minutes or so of this film makes no sense. The motive behind the killings was not explained at the beginning of the film. I would say it was a way for the director to take out the movie, but on the DVD there are scenes deleted! I'm not sure why anyone wants to see more than a feature version of Bleed, but people who stand behind the DVD seem to think viewers will be asking for more. In the box, she says that there are Easter eggs, but why the hell that I want to waste looking for extras in this movie is something outside of me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad film, and the movie "Bleed" was delivered on this front. It was not a bad movie yet. Everyone looks good in the film, and there's a lot of nudity, but acting is terrible. My favorite character is the guy who ends up being a killer ... I think he's supposed to be funny and muscular, but he ended up in the end. I think the most extreme moment in the film is when our heroine is killed in the parking garage, in a very unconvincing death. The heroine is pushing the women to the cement pillar in the parking lot, and the woman looks as if she is barely bumping into something, spitting her blood and dying. "<br /> <br /> For those who believe that filmmaking is a complex and creative process by professionals, "It will change your mind, and you will realize that any breakthrough can be made by a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time or money on it.
