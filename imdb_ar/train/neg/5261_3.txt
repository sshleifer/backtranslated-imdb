I have read some other comments and I have to agree with comments that have not reached the end. I thought it was going pretty well .. until the end. Keep your mind working and then yell. I have no idea what happened in the last minutes of the film except for the complete chaos. It looks like they ran out of money to come to a good end so they ran out. First, they had something mysterious that makes people disappear, and then they talked to someone talking about Area 51 (which makes you think of foreigners) and then they went into nonsense. I thought actors and actresses did a good job. However, if you are watching this movie, you will be ready for disappointment in the end.
