The whole thing is very nice to look at ... the shooting on the European site was a good idea. Leading actors are attractive. The result is serviceable. <br /> <br /> But after they talked! The plot is advanced! Each slope was from there. Pachino goes through sleep and Keller continues to talk about how boring she is, Hello dear, you are not alone. When you mimic Mae West, you may have to hide your face, it's painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how Sydney Pollack's actor or director got involved in this, or better question, why did it end up stinking? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, you should probably enjoy low fun here. Maybe you should feel it empty and cold like death. But I still can not recommend it.
