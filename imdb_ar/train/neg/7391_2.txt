Well, like most fans of Steven Seagal, I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time I make a film, but I expect the film to have a budget for screening at least. The main problem in the version I saw is terrible when dubbing and I know that in some movies it must be done and I agree but when they exaggerate their voice with quite different actors and continue to do so through the film it takes the magic of overdubbing away. It seems that the groups are built carelessly as in one scene, the sliding glass in a highly secreted laboratory has a big crack going through it. I was really disappointed with this film and I just wish that the next Stevens project was completed before sending the movie for purchase / lease. The story of this film prompted me to wonder whether I was watching a science film or some parts did not seem strange to them, but they did not quite explain what was happening to me.
