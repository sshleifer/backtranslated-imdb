Freeway Killer, is a crazy man who shoots people on the highway while shouting a series of mysterious chants on the car phone. Police believe he is a random killer, but Sani, the blond heroine, played by Darlan Flugel, discovers a pattern. The same is true of James Rousseau's former policeman, who is challenging their forces and bodies to search for the villain who gets rid of their wives. Also starring Richard Belzer, this film has its own moments especially if you like chasing cars, but in fact it is not a good movie for the most part, check it out if you're really bored and you've already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown, otherwise stay away from the freeway.
