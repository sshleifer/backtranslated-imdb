What were they thinking of "was"? One of the most outrageous films of all time. All the details of this film, no matter how insignificant. If I had to watch her wear these shoes again, I thought I would scream. If the aim of this film is to show how Rosetta's life was pathetic, it was covered during the first fifteen minutes of the film and then credits should have worked. But no, we had to see innumerable countless scenes over and over again. Everything was full of unpopular and unpopular characters. They deserved the misery that Rashid had. I think I finished the "Tumbleweeds" to see this film of excessive boredom. It was like watching the grass grow, just this more exciting.
