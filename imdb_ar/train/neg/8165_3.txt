It's a ghost story. It is the story of cannibals. It is a story of revenge. It's a very bad film with a lot of violence. I suppose it is followed cheaply like any italic film I have ever seen. It has a usual isolated place, a cocky campground, bound to the wild. Granted, there are some very intense scenes. It's just too boring. Bad editing and all the work. There are ghost children who seem to be talking in a trash can. I'm not really sure what rules the ghosts are playing with the seed cover. It also has a terrible scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually the rest of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it was necessary to show this kind of gratuitous violence. I fear that this is just another step in our sensitive development. Three are not smart here, no tongue in cheek, just a sad waste of time. Lots of blood. A small plot.
