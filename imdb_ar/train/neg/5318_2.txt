Well, I had to be a vine and I gave this number 2. This was mainly due to the unexplained holes that were cut in the shirt of that lady where her breasts are. I found it amusing to say the least. Other than that, this movie does nothing more than just make some good laughs with a friend. Funny if you want to cast "Mystery Science Theater" on the comments with someone, but it is not better than 2. The 2 sucks pretty much.
