This film should be one of the worst, if not the worst, films I've ever seen. (I could not see it all the way). It is simply just gratuitous violence for him and the funny storyline adds only to poor and incompetent portrayals. Illness. Suitable only for those who have a love for mania distortion. After several hundred men, women and children were killed, Sayed was finally arrested after many police officers were killed unhindered, who eventually received information about his whereabouts. He was sentenced to death on an electric chair and miraculously left! He was buried alive, digging his way and planning to avenge those who put him away and refused the key. Needless to say, more heinous murders ...
