This movie must be number one at the bottom of 100. Acting is so horrible that when I and my son watched his illness almost physically. The story is worse. I could have gone ahead and how bad it was, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to review "Francopop" where I do not see anyone else having trouble doing it yet. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God, we saw it on TV, so we did not spend anything on it. If we had, we would have had to write the people responsible for this abomination and have been forced to execute in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher. But sad to say that it is not worth watching in this particular film. Do not spoil your opinion of Carrie by watching him.
