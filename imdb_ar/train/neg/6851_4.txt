FEH. This film began in an interesting way, but it soon turned into a series of confusing to drab. The confusing parts occurred mostly at first, where the scenes were so numerous that it was difficult to determine what was happening within the first 20 minutes or so. Bale comes later, with a lukewarm love story between the two living beings (both pussies). The spirit of revenge for the dead girl is in fact the most vital person in the film, which is sad. If the rest of the cast has reached its caliber, the film may be better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story of the story is really interesting, as it seems that the mother of the priestess crazy girl sixteen years old trying to revive her daughter from the dead, with the unfortunate side effects that all the other dead will return as well, take a human form solid, and most likely Start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystical night of dead type is a living thing. But this does not come. Although this priestess is washed with a small basket tied on his head telling the young people who do not care that this will happen if the priest completes her ritual, they only do so and the only death that appears is her daughter. There is no mass of the dead, no army walking from the corpses, nothing. The priest only makes the spirit of the girl return to the land of the dead, and comes out of her boyfriend washed with her, because she crushed his spine like crisp peanuts (at this point, I was inclined to cheer loudly, went idiot to kiss and take care of the dead girl, ewwww !!!). Robitussen, the weakest personal friend, takes a long intrusive shot in the end and she leaves the village for the last time, that's all. No real horror, no real creep, the Japanese tend to achieve much better than American filmmakers by focusing on the over-cheesy make-up, without a shouting tradition. I was very disappointed.
