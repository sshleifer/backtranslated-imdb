This film claims to be a personal deviation study. Some reviewers have slowed down the assumption that because of the depiction of the deviation, the film is psychologically deep; in fact, given the fun stuff, it is surprisingly boring and shallow, with no stimulant. Why is the main character as it is? You will not discover this from the script. For a better treatment of the same subject (and a more enjoyable film), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
