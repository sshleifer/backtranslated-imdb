Pyramid Guides $ 25,000: Deep Blue Sea. Shiver. slid. Eight leg flight. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies were funnier and more exciting than snakes on board a plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with this definition I would like to include a relatively painful trip Ted and Elaine in the plane! Superior to snakes in both laughter and excitement. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this is not close to the mother of all the unintentionally funny comic films: Anaconda! In addition to not appearing again to create JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same click, you had Jon Voight pulling away from movie-stealing all the time. The last scene alone represents everything that SOAP tried and failed to do as "ridiculous, fun". <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is conclusive evidence that studio execs and fanboys make the worst possible collaborators. Every big scene was discussed and sliced ​​a lot last year, and all that was left amusing at the opening night was the amount of rough sweat that had to be eliminated in my play. I heard more forced laughter here than recorded it in the studio for "According to Jim".
