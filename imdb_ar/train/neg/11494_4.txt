Richard Dicks is a great industrial man, not very pleasant and has worked almost to death. If he takes the leave suggested by his doctors, does he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, it is probably better off if you ignore the voice of Whistler. <br /> <br /> William Castle's entrance contains some brilliant moments (an introduction and depiction of Richard Dix's life through newsreel a la Citizen Ken), and some intriguing plot in the final rollers. Dix's performance is generally good. Unfortunately, it does not work because the person does not end up buying until the characters act the way they do. Also, the film moves from the beginning of a dark (and a wonderful beginning) to a movie that is almost as enjoyable as 30 years, like the middle section (full of gentle urban genres who do not mind that they are not rich) and back to the complex Nuer plot of another 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This is a suitable movie - worth watching - but it needs a little more running time to create a couple of characters and lead a female capable of meeting the demands of her role.
