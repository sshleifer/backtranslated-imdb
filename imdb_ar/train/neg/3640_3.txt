I had no background knowledge of this film before I bought it, but it seemed fantastic and I wanted to see a real film about the Vikings now ... Unfortunately, this was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead, the Soap Opera was delivered from the boring Nordic countries that seemed to last for a long time despite the time it took 84 minutes. The film's premise is interesting: It revolves around one of the Viking warlords who challenge his god, and angers Odin to the point that he accuses the son of the warlord, called Barrick, of dying to death and advancing as a berserk. After that, Barek is forced to live angry, crazy and violent after his life. The film was filmed with sufficient efficiency, with some rich film works and good performances by actors, but again, I found myself bored and wondering when this trifle ended. Filmmakers had the opportunity to make something entertaining and semi-unique but dropped the ball. Perhaps it could have been improved through some of the cheap methods of exploitation that have been thrown, such as unjustified nudity and a lot of burdens ... I mean, we're talking about "bullies" here, right? The Vikings were supposed to be bad enough. What about all the rapes and looting? Are not the raiders supposed to be more extreme? All in all, unless you are a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) Or, are you, in fact, a crazy eccentric who loves self-torture, perhaps moved away from this horrible celluloid piece.
