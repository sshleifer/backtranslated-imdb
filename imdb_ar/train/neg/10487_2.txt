My God! The only reason to give this movie 2 instead of 1 is that Tom Hanks is funny as Elvis in the box. Apart from that, how did this mid-way actor sign in to do this lame movie? Maybe it looked good at the time ... There are no laughs to mention, pathetic stereotypes, wasted cast, and the trend is amateur. Now that I've thought about it, most of the blame is probably on the director, Joel Zwick. Only flat offers come out from all concerned. Do not waste your time as you did. But then, I enjoy the wreck of a good train. Geez, the system now tells me that I need more fonts - here ya go: this movie should be called Return to Sender. Well, now it was more entertaining than anything in the movie ...
