"Return of the Boogeman" is a horror film that is not like a movie. It's like an episode of a comedy television series when it turns into old episodes. The return of the Boogyman movie is just a clip. <br /> <br /> The movie clip is fixed and disturbing from the first film. Repeatedly the same footage. how boring. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a psychic woman who has visions of the first film. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first movie I do not want to see the same scenes over and over again and I do not know who to do. The entire film looks like it was quickly manufactured to make a few bucks and that's it.
