I was amazed that reviewers @ IMDb presented this TV movie as a high rating as they did. It's an uncomplicated, uncomplicated complex clich√© of a film with two big names from the past (both of which did a good job), but it's the low-budget work we can see on any day of the week on less cable channels. I love a good love story as well as anyone else, but my wife and I watched this - and before we saw the evaluation - we said: "There are people who will rate this film very high because there is simply nothing to challenge their brains, faith, level of comfort or cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good film in this way (and away from it is an example), but this was the amateur hour, and there are some good films that have been classified as much less than this, really, another film in a long series of holiday films is not enough, See The Family Stone, it is miles ahead of this impasse.
