Drew Barrymore continues to see her changing ego throughout the city and has already begun to become a pain in the backside. <br /> <br /> After Dee rented an apartment from a penetrating writer, she became confronted with the other "Drew" more frequently. Her author feels it is his responsibility to pick up the "real draw" from her amazement, so he does his best to help, including seducing her as soon as he has free time. It is not very interesting, it is less frightening, but Drew is as exciting as usual, especially when a group of corrupt construction workers give a finger ... Yes Drew, this is hot! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best scene is where Drew has stabbed her real mother, O Jade, with a big kitchen knife ... Hmmm ... and how was your day?
