I think the biggest thing that can happen is to be boring. The bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has an interesting fact of occurrence in Cambodia. Some of the films made in America in the 1930s were in Cambodia. However, the conflict there is little hard to know. Even troop movements are a bit confusing. What drives her to a loud pause is a love story. Why are these two men completely enslaved to a dark blonde I do not know. I thought he should continue to use zombie (as it is) and forget about it all. The film only plods along. The ideal thumbnail is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest across the water to reach the secret place where the hieroglyphs (or anything) that explains how to turn people into zombies are saved. I thought they would not get there. One man takes two steps. Stops. He looked around me. The other man is hiding behind some columns. Take two steps. Stops. He looked around me. The other man is hiding behind some bushes. This is a short film. Then there is a poorly represented and false dialogue. Actually I have a lot of patience when it comes to movies B. This one is unbearable. By the way, the most appropriate title would be the Revolving Revolution.
