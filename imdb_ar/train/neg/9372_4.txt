This is a typical universal horror flick typical: by its technicality, if through numbers, with a cake cut plot and some serious exaggeration. The most interesting part of this film is the casting of Rondo Hatton's stunt, a man with osteoarthritis as a "monster" in the film. Sad to see this man exploited, but perhaps used the money they paid him. Hutton was less terrified than the studio had hoped, where she often felt pity for fear or even hatred. Martin Kosslak is a crazy film artist, and he is very interesting in this part. I enjoy seeing Koslack in anything; for some reason the man entertains me. The only other part of the film I enjoyed is the strange film in the art world. Here shows us evil art critics who enjoy their ability to break artists; this along with the male "hero" of the movie who is "artist" paints ... make this ... hanging girls. Somehow our hero's work is reviewed along with the silly sculpture of the elephant. It also highlights the great critic of the film, who at some point claims to despise the art of the hero because "such women do not exist" to which our heroine responds with the emphasis that the critic does not come out adequately. Finally, there is a little sub-plot about the domestication of the heroine (who criticizes the art herself) by a leading man ... fully reproachful and ridiculous to testify. Overall this film is fairly mediocre with some amusing elements.
