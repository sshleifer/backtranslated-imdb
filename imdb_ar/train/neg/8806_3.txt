How has this "rupture" become so loved? People say it is proof that a decent and fair man can succeed despite a lack of intelligence. They are wrong. I hope your friend will invest all your money in Apple and not Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one in the sea when a storm breaks out; I hope you do not die of shock when you happily hit the buttocks rather than the back; I hope you do not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically repressive - all the rebels against community conferences lose their legs, use drugs, beat their friends or die young. In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is rude. The emotional manipulation film is very, very empty.
