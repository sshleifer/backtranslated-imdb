However, there is another film about a group of less intelligent people on a road trip wandering their original travel route either for a brief tour or, in this case, for a side-by-side tour. The results, as expected, are not good at all, because this special offer is home to a group of recruits inside prisons who have escaped prison inmates from previous years. The father, apparently a professional photographer, must stop and take pictures of the place only to find that he is still occupied. Various family members walk around to see various sights, just for fear. Thinking about how they managed to walk safely on their way, the window of the vehicle explodes (surprise!), Leaving them looking for shelter and accommodation in the small town, which we discovered was inhabited only by vistas (surprise!). <br /> <br /> This movie shows as expected, where the family is tracked and killed by freaks. There are some fights on the part of families, but this is probably one of the worst scenes in the film, where it is poorly executed. There is nothing remotely authentic here, unless you return the very inappropriate soundtracks that are played through certain scenes that completely destroy the atmosphere and mood of the film. The representation is as bad as I have seen at some time by all concerned (it's very bad when your actors outperform Camp Blood). The special effects are lousy and the end has made me want to punch my TV. <br /> <br /> However, despite all the drawbacks, I enjoyed the film somewhat. The film is definitely "very bad, it's good" and I took it out through the whole movie and I was so delighted to have gone beyond the ridiculous Clichy plot, the horrible acting and the cheese stuff, although the end left me feeling cheated and angry, Get started and the finish makes the whole movie useless. <br /> <br /> In summary, I can list countless movies I saw if I saw them, and the difference is that most of this film is better, if not a complete waste, this film is very bad and not scary remotely. <br /> <br /> My appreciation:
