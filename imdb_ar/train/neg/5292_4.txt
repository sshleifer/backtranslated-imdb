I can not recommend this movie as a film history. Gary Oldman's half-biography of the life of a drug in southeastern London is a violent and piquant story of one of Dante's hell circles, frankly. In its center is Ray Winston, who has done this kind of character before but not so well. The movie opens with him asking for drinks in the bar bar - that's all - and you already suffer from a sense of frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he presents in different ways during the film. It is a key representative category. <br /> <br /> Of course, the frustrated and the downtrodden need to thwart a dramatic film like this and end up Cathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, sucking her up and eventually rejecting his intolerable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles plays an active role as Billy's daughter, who has been struck by the lighting of the valves, although he should have sometimes wondered exactly what he allowed himself. Gary Oldman draws close to the actors, compounding the phobia of flat surfaces. 10/04
