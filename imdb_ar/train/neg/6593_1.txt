Even remotely funny, this moldy wax for a film is still disrespectful. Stop digging for the bodies of the boys and reactivating the "Bernese Weekend" ?? But only just? Producer Larry Harmon and film director Ernst Frikin use copyright as a pretext to seize the legacy of Stan and Lynn. Gailard Sartain is impersonating a rational personality but Bronson Pinchot will not reach 10th place in the Stan contest like it; even if they both spot on the film will not be less hateful. To say the least about the surrounding disaster was the better. Makes Utopia look like a decent swan song.
