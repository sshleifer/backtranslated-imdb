I admit that I have a feeling of uneasiness about ghost films, and while I sometimes enjoy this kind of horror when it comes to horror, when it comes to comedy, they really need to be crazy to be funny. It seems that "more than her dead body" takes life afterlife very seriously, and fails in my opinion of almost any aspect I can think of. The story is absolutely unbelievable, of course, and it did not convince me either in comic books or in the emotional record. The choice of main actresses was awful. While Paul Rod is at least handsome and seems to be a nice guy, it seems that the taste of the ladies in his personality needs to be greatly improved because Eva Longoria looks older (sorry) for him, and Lake Belle seems very unattractive (sorry again). A romance story without a good reason for romance is due to failure from the start. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloan were both better off but only supporting roles. The rest is uninterested and uninspiring, with flat cinematography and cheap guises borrowed from an unsuccessful television comedy. Nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
