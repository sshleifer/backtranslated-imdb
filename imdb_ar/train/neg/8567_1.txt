When I rented this movie, my expectations were very low ... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was the worst), and the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (except for homicides), but this is not a comedy, it's a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing: they can add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! Give it 0 and a half of 5.
