Marvin (Rob Schneider) did not have the ingredients to be a policeman, and he was his permanent dream. But his luck changes when he has a car wreck (very bad) and the doctor finds it. The doctor should use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he begins wild behavior unconsciously and becomes the best cop that can ever be. By that time, he is aware of the changes and begins his animal instincts to take over his humanitarian side. At the same time, he finds a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect man and that means he must control himself and act civilized. I'm not a great fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is the first film I saw. However, I can easily say that it is the best person playing the loser. (See his role in Ally Mcbeal, very funny indeed). There are some good parts in the movie like flirting goats. In these movies, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is fine to watch as long as it is not taken seriously. But it is very sad to see such films doing a very good job at the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I have seen yet but it fails to get over *.
