This kind of exotic film, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights the devil and his followers ... but it is still fun. <br /> <br /> He has some real laughs. All of them were deliberate and certainly debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" or "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
