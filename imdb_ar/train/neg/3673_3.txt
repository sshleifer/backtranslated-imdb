William Hurt diving scientist US agents who run an overseas investigation? The sick sick man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on the back and running away? Sniper missing and not killed Hurt (only his injury) but the second "killed" dead fire on? waste of time. Comparing this to the downfall as other reviewers did is ridiculous. At the end of the film, they decided to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the "evil" worker and Hurt decided to kill him by giving him a "virus shake". What? BTW ... When does IMDb require 10 lines of text? I'm just raving here. Does this not only dilute the content of revisions if it is required to have x number of fonts?
