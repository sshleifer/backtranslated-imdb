The five truly good Westerners whom Man has made are unlike any other group in Hollywood. Even John Ford did not do that much with high quality. The odd thing about all of them is how diverse they are. My Ford Clementine Darling is worth about two and a half from any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them along with Man and Stuart is Chase. Hunt being responsible for the magnificent Red River. Chase wrote a remote country, bending from the river, and perhaps others. But none of them ended up like My Darling Clementine, but then a few movies, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of the five Man movies has huge gaps, or six movies, let's see. Bend, Far, West Man, Angry, Winchester 73, True, Six, Naked Spore. Each has a wonderful scenery after a wonderful sight, with fairly glaring aftershocks. However, the Red River, which is still the greatest Westerners at all. So perfection is not all. <br /> <br /> But the maximum country has huge holes. It's hard to reach, and really comes alive only when Stuart and McIntair close the horns. The rest are pretty pedestrians, except for the usual Mann camera. Man camera is a one-man course in the cinema. It's a good eye like anyone standing behind a bar of animated movies. It never happened in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The country enjoys the most amazing moment. As usual it comes from Stuart. No one in the history of cinema received any physical punishment with the power of that man. It's very amazing: see him in Bend, Far, Winchester, and Man from Laramie: Bend is beaten with a very certified string and this boiled hatred seems like a man driven out of Dachau, in the extreme shooting at a large group of this kind of violence , It seems very convincing that you are rushing, and of course when you are dragged into a fire in a man, you find yourself looking for signs of burns. What a representative. Not to mention the moment he spent in Winchester when he was beaten early in the hotel room, as well as anyone who did so. <br /> <br /> But that was Man's land: Look at Gary Cooper and he is fighting with Jack Lord in The West Man. As painful as any battle scene ever recorded. While Cooper was not as persuasive as Stuart, he was equally equal to the way he looked at him at the end of the fighting. In short, no one, but no one, never one, man at the extreme and so did Man. <br /> <br /> What a great great exit. <br /> <br /> See every Western made at all. It is its real effects, even if all of them are spectacular. But what about it. When he rides his great sights, he is as good as anyone, including Ford. The six geckos as a group are the best ever by anyone, <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
