The spoilers will be in this. The movie could have been better if they had a different text, director and CGI resource. Not much true? The movie includes a man who starts his own park ... he makes a mistake ... a zoo on an abandoned island where people can see dinosaurs ... they make mistakes ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... excuse me ... Primal Park. I do not mind rupture, because there are no original ideas for this type of film, but this film only claps you in the face, it happens that there is even something "shady creature's head on the design." The Sabrioths, which is not a pure ballast according to Mr. Primal Park (only the deadly old cats), are rather tricky but the completion of the coronation is what I call "Slugi". Because, after getting rid of one big cat, the hero relaxes a bit because there is only one leftover. Enter the strange nutritionist who says, Nah, we have made three, and the third is a monster walking around with his forelegs. Great, wonderful. There is a group of college students on the island also to search for scavengers, and there is a test to enter the cliques or their fur (I always think he needed a short title). Among the people living, one of them completed their mission, so I got a kick from it. Oh yes, "evil evil group must die," the group is valid without anyone, but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most laughable one in any of these films while the smell of the statue of the statue of Sabretooth (courtesy of Sloggy) disappears, shrinks in a few sizes, and the man shakes through the throat. If you've got away just that easy. I love the "Sabretooth" better than this offer.
