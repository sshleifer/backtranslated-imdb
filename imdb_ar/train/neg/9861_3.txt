I sat through this at GenCon just because it was quiet and I could nap. What a waste of time. Beverly Dangello and William Cat? WTF? Was the lady who played Flo and my father Vegoda busy or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a piece of junk is unfamiliar. The characters were stereotyped without meaning (I think ...) and wooden, and most of them seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other alleged reviews have been compromised, and I cry over the book. <br /> <br /> I am puzzled by how anyone can find this worthy of his time, seriously. I just give it 3 out of 10 because in order to be 2 or 1, you'll need to be either for five hours or be more Kelly LeBrook.
