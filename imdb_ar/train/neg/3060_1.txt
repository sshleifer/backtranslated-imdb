This must be a scary film, the most twisted holiday you ever had, and that's something to say. I know that the Mexican people have some strange ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But the day of the dead is not half as scary as with Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So, Santa is not some of the red-hot alcoholic drinks (see these pink cheeks sometimes!). Instead, he is a socially educated young man who lives in heaven (or heaven, whatever it is), with a group of children who work harder than boys at race shops in Cathay Gifford. They sing nice traditional songs from their homelands while wearing very typical clothes that I was surprised that there was no African-American boy wearing a black face singing Mami. Santa Claus is a peeping Tom who watches and listens to everything that everyone does "his eye in the sky". This is so he can figure out who was Chickia or nice (focusing on those hooligans, I bet). <br /> <br /> There are no Ms. Claus, no elves (what do elves need when they have child labor?) and the reindeer are mechanical wind games! This floating freak hovers over a cloud, possibly holding a silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's enemy is ... the devil ?! What is this, Santa our Lord and Savior? wondrous. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his followers, a retreating Demon, called Pitch, to try to solve the Christmas problem. Let me get this straight from the purest evil forces trying to destroy a totally driven and greedy business holiday? Sounds like kind of redundant, right? <br /> <br /> The stadium is not fully functional. He tries to talk some children to be bad, but he does not have much luck. I was struck by the story of the little girl Saint Lopez, a very poor family. All you want is a doll for Christmas, but he can not afford to buy one for her (they've spent all their money on the cardboard they built their house from). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. In fact, this is the only way a poor girl can get a doll, because Saint and pray to God and Santa Sacrament are not really working. But the lobby resists temptation and asks the Pitch to make you stand behind it, and then your reward is rewarded by giving you a very creepy doll that looks like you know perfectly well that she is Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> Along the way run by Pitch to get Santa stuck in a tree (huh) from where he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You must bend! How long have mythical dramas appeared in Christmas tales, or have they been associated with a Christian religion? Does not God reject magic? They burned Merlin at stake a few hundred years ago, without asking him to come to save one aspect of God (or that's what I suppose Santa should have, to stand against Satan). This movie is a long one huh? From start to finish, and it will make you wonder if that tomato you drank did not explode or not. Maybe it was, because this movie looks like a giant one long DT.
