I've seen some crazy movies in my life, but this movie has to be among the worst. Definitely down 100 items (imo, ie). <br /> <br /> We follow a couple, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lone Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlin) and Kirkendals (Patrick Sweezy as Roy and Charles Theron as Candy) in one car on the way to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not very happy with his sex life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who desperately tries to have a baby. Roy, at the same time, is not sure if the sperm is fine, so the doctor checks it. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the back of the DVD, but my friend did not, and it went off after about 20 minutes: "Oh, she will become pregnant but her husband can not have any child." Spot, because this movie is soooo predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Its meaning. offensive. Horrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how widespread this movie is. The couple drove in their big car toward Nevada when they were stopped by two police officers who did not stop at a stop sign. The men know each other and finally they throw the two officers in a beer. This scene is not limited to being unimportant and unimportant (or even relevant) to the movie, but it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk, talk and talk, without going anywhere at all. <br /> <br /> I still have to think about the end. Apparently, Roy does not face problems there, so he is the father of the child. How often does it happen in movies ... try something new! In the end, the deceived wife forgives her husband and best friend because of their relationship, and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene for the film is finally, with a few shots from the Grand Canyon. Why could not they keep the camera on for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One expects more of this group (although Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Woe, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
