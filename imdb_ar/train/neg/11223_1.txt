I saw the film, and I felt terrified because the film did not really communicate with me as listeners. The language would be ashamed of the loungers in the streets. <br /> <br /> Plot; father does not force any of his son to marry, seems elusive. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandfather who asks her big child to mess with the enemy will only draw the attention of the weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... I was waiting for the entire movie to laugh and laugh I did stupid to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the film was not worth even the first look. <br /> <br /> I hope it saves your time!
