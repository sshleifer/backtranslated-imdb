So I heard from a few people that this movie made them cry in the theater. When I first saw him I was expecting another tearful romantic film by Barbara Streisand; something like the way we were. I was definitely wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to attach to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. The character of Streisand fell into an alcohol addict who could not sing a single note without wanting to press the fast forward button. On one occasion, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and forgives him after five minutes. There is nothing romantic about a deadly rock star and a woman can not realize it until she actually dies. Parts of the film seemed to go on and on, and I kept asking myself when it would end. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was quite predictable. There was a perfectly clear prediction of his reckless behavior early in the film, and when he died I did not feel any emotion at all. It was not a tragic accident, he was basically stupid. Not to mention throughout the movie you're distracted by his dreaded chin. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie worth watching are the Streisand songs. The end of the film when she sang "With One More Look At You / Watch Closely Now" was the reason I was given this movie 3/10. Those seven minutes were the only part of the film in which I actually felt emotion other than anger and anger.
