I should never start this movie, and I stopped watching after 3/4. I missed the really failed end. This movie was disappointing because it could have been much better. The atmosphere was nice, cast and director of first class, good locations. But the story line Baad, a bad script. I was interested in Kenneth Branagh's Southern accent - it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in unrealistic and improbable ways. Nobody acts like this outside the Hollywood scripts.
