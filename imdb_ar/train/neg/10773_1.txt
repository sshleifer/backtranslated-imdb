I've seen this hideous thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of the movies you watch just to see how bad it is. Honestly, I do not know how much less tape can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are of a lame stereo type one by one, and the obvious attempt to create "bad bears for the news" is too embarrassing to say too little. <br /> <br /> I have seen some precious turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to include any of them because this is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me put you this way, I saw Vanilla Ice, because it was so bad it was funny. This ... this ... is not that good.
