So ... we get to see additional footage of Brando ... interesting but not exactly the things Oscar deserves. Susanna York was barely sagging. A new scene where Lewis discovered that Clark is Superman is a bit unbelievable because he does not notice the voids coming out of the gun instead of the real bullets. The real bullets broke through his clothes and then he got back on the ground but forget it ... Let's listen to Donner make fun of the Lester version that was more logical. The President speaks of Zod's "distortion" of Washington's monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. The tweaking in this scene made this line very silly. The Superman line of "press freedom" seemed silly compared to "out-of-the-exterior", which was delivered better and had a proper connection to Clark's previous scene at the truck station. Then there is the end with the effect of "re-world to return in time." He rewrote everything in the film and made you wonder where exactly the rocket targeted Hackensack, N.J. He ever went because he did not free Zod and the company anymore.
