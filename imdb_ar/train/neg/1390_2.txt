I am a fan of the B5 and have just caught the end of the third season. I watched wholeheartedly all the previous seasons when they were published, and concluded that it was one of the most studied story arcades on television. Even filler rings were interesting. The films, too, have been produced as well and entertaining as anything that hits the theaters. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to the River of Souls. Of course, after seeing everything else, I had great expectations. It seems that Martin Chen is acting in the Ed Wood film instead of a serious science fiction story. The story itself, probably looked good in outline form, so made it a storyboard. However, it is clear that when it is time to fill this idea in a two-hour film. There are no special effects to keep us enjoying the complete absence of a compelling story. There were places that were obviously tight and put the dialog box to fill the story. If this made the regular season, he would have been ranked among the worst episodes.
