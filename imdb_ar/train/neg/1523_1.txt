This "movie" must be the largest stack of steaming C * ^ p that I've ever seen <br /> <br />, what can I say more than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD and BAD. There is nothing to save this "movie" and I call they do not even talk about making a sequel. If you're thinking about watching this, you should know that the story is that two men from the trash are being dragged to save the earth. Films like Men in Black have been torn into objects and reassembled to make this "comedy" but they completely failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
