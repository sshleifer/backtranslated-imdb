Do not waste your time on this Drake. As shown in the picture, the characters do not have initial values, and watching them interact with others is just torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, and that's nonsense. If you want to see pampered and spoiled poets struggling to beat each other, this may be in your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why choosing others to spend more than five minutes is really puzzling. Mary Schill seems to be the only person in any column at all, but she is out of the ordeal without respect. What a waste of time. See goth instead. I also remember watching another great movie based on the same subject, but I did not get the title. I hoped that was what happened, but no such luck. Not recommended.
