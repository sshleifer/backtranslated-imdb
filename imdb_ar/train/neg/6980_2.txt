Historically accurate? Well ... maybe ... if liberated, the light fell on the subject altogether. But basic precision does not compensate for a dismal, incomplete and inconsistent plot, cardboard dialogue messages and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are just descriptions; embarrassing stereotypes ranging from "mysterious and noble" American Indians to British officers, "the suffocates but the sadists." Delinquent and inappropriate delivery for a wonderful period in American history. I want to recover my money.
