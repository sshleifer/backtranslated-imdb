There is no reason to study this more because of some misleading and misleading statements. <br /> <br /> The ideal example is when the director Saul or Paul Taros (author of the Hebrews) asserts that he has no idea that Jesus was or was a human being, this assertion is either intentionally false because he accuses others of offering it, He does not know what the Bible says. <br /> <br /> First, we can examine his misleading claim of Hebrews 8.4, which shows "If Jesus is on earth, he will not be a priest." So he prepared the ignorant and uneducated scenes to accept his false hypothesis. Why? He does the so-called Bible believing in the people he accuses of doing, which is the same thing. This makes things out of context. <br /> <br /> Verse 1 of Hebrews 8: 1 "Now one of the things we talked about is the total: we have such a great priest, who was appointed to the right of His Majesty's throne in heaven" The context above speaks Clearly about Jesus who was on earth and ascended to heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the director wants to take the viewer out of context. Here is presented the basis that "Paul was not aware of Jesus Christ, but only one in" Paradise "<br /> <br /> Followed? <br /> <br /> Lets you know if the director is honest; 14. "For it is clear that our Lord came out of Judah; from any tribe Moses did not speak of the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> Hey, did not the director quote from the Hebrew writer trying to show that the author of this book has no knowledge of" human Jesus? "Possibly Paul did not write Hebrews anyway, but I will not go into this It is here, but the filmmaker asserts that Paul has done it, and that is the premise that lies here. <br /> <br /> This filmmaker does not make decent points in certain areas, but shares the same blind bias about the religion he criticizes, Once he becomes involved in these tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses his credibility as a religion that chose the film, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, a concession to the director of the film, Less.
