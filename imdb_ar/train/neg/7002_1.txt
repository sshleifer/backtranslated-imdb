I saw this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I find that this is worse then I. I have no idea why they even made another film, it was stupid and it is unfortunate to say that I have all of them. I sat through them several times and still pushed me to turn it off for 5 minutes in the movie. I love Terence Hill and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie pushed me to the top. If he has a different story story or at least a plot and more comedy, it might be more fun and the $ 5 price I spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I say that saving your money and not saying goodbye to this movie or any of those you trust trusts in this film.
