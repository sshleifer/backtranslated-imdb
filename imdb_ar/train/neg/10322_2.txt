If you're looking for abuse, fun, or both, you're probably looking elsewhere. LMOTP is really not so impossible to provoke the rewriting of the usual silly cliches. At the end of the second episode, I felt a bit embarrassed because I was already sitting in the alleged chaos. <br /> <br /> Behind the veiled tilt hypothesis that attracted all the initial attention to it, it is just another lame idea, a harmful and anti-sewage attempt in the commentary and entertainment that CBC usually excels in production. And once "Muslims of ZOMG in rural ROFLMAO !!" The hype is warmly welcomed, it is likely that the program will follow the ether of cancellation because it is very shallow when judged on its merits alone. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with Islamic culture in the West and / or are easily entertained by the most nuanced details on the subject, I do not really see how LMOTP is more enjoyable than satisfying the curiosity caused by noise. Other presentations have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic divide in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never be classified into entertainment or foresight.
