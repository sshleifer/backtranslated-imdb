I got the hypothesis, but it was clear for about 30 seconds that this was either David Lynch or something terribly terrible. Interesting to watch just to run through the list of fundamentalist laundry. I could be a sucker for the erotic piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it at all. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend that we have 80 IQ (or simply get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to Lia?) And that we follow the Bible blindly without any kind of self-examination at all or we'll run the second coming. It's a kind of attitude that makes people fly by giant planes to 110 storey buildings (I work near the former World Trade Center site). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
