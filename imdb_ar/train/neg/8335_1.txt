Al-Wafaa suggests that Warren Betty and Goldie Hawn are avoiding a massive bank robbery, but that's not what I came out of! I did not get anything! In the first half, there is a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half of the hour is completely incomprehensible, and the rest is just a long, annoying and hidden chase scene. There is always an annoying sound in the background, whether it's a high-speed watch, a siren, a train whistling, or even the horrible result of Quincy Jones. There are lots of very bad parts. Like, bad guys chasing my house on a slave ice with a car! Or police arrive at the scene about 15 times. I really hated this movie!
