I will not spend too much time or energy in this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were very positive and I felt I should tell people that everyone is not very happy, not to mention being intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical mystery. Some scenes looked promising, played with visual dimensions, but could not bear the rest. I felt as though I had been stoned for the first time again, having had some sort of philosophical conversation with your adolescent colleagues. <br /> <br /> What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. The best view of Jesus is the eye of Palestijn, without all his direct sense of humor, as raises questions about life and the realities that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and apparently will not be.
