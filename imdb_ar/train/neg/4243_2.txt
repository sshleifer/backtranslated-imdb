The funniest scene for this movie is most likely when rescuers get their medals, paintings and so on. So the basic idea is that the police outnumber gangsters from one million to one, but they are helpless because the bad guys are a little bigger. I think the police ammunition is just excluded Kinda. They decided to film this film in a documentary style through fake and serious interviews. What's wrong with these guys? They speak as if they were armed with published newspapers. Well, admit, it's likely to stay in the line of fire, even when the situation is in your favor a lot, but do not get lost. And why did hell take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I would say that this is a very long time when surrounded by them and allows you to shoot. They are ten feet away, and have never reached anything. Then they go and buy bigger weapons for themselves to increase their heroism. Then yes, here you are, a policeman is already beating someone. The bullet may have been converted by a lamp or something. I had a good laugh I think.
