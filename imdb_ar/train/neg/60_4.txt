I liked Goldie Hawn and wanted another film of hers, so when I saw a protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart I bought it. Though moderately amusing, the film never made a mistake. Some scenes, such as concert scenes in the bar, continue for a very long time and have no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, there is a preacher scene at the end of the film giving everyone a bad taste film as much as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene is added to the film at all. I do not like dumb comedy movies that try to teach me a lesson, written by the film '' 's 60's burns, especially! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm delighted to own another Hawn movie, I'm definitely not really worth the money I paid for it!
