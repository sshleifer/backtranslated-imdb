First, before you read more, you must understand that I am not a new Nazia, I am just trying to understand Hitler correctly to make sure that no one like him takes power again. <br /> <br /> I've seen this series and found it awful. I mean, well, it's interesting to look at, but is this real? I searched for answers and found one: Definitely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, as the series showed Hitler angry, even as a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to misuse his daughter. In fact, it is very likely that Hitler, in fact, was a lesbian and fought all his life to stifle this secret. Thirdly, people hate me but that's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he hated it and his ugliness? Because it was charming. This is a common point found in interviews of people living near or away from him (of course, not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was awful because if you think Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, of course, not a witch at all, you're wrong. If you think so, you will allow people like him to seize power in countries and do not want to. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get to power, stop thinking that he was awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop the subject before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Life is important for protection, this series is awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like this, another series will happen just like the first.
