This film does not really encourage children to be nicer and to have better attitudes, as should the family film, and this family will not be considered anyway because it contains some things that children should not see. Not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If there are less sexual themes in the film, it may be better. Hollywood does not do anything to make the film better by adding sexual attitudes. There really is no reason for them. At least this is a television movie. I do not want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watching this movie, please continue to it.
