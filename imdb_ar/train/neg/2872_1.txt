This is by far the worst horror I've seen in 29 years. If someone does this to you for free, let them know. This movie makes you the dumbest person to see that you saw it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ..... It's acting, camera action, lighting, and sound. There's nothing you like about this movie. All of the pay for this movie is broken now. I hope the director does not get the green light for another film. In his defense, this film was quickly produced to try to capture the actual BTK killer, but I saw a film about the weeks that looked like Oscars.
