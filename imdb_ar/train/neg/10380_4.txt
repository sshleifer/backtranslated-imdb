I do not think anyone sitting to watch this movie expects anything remotely seen as a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it ends if you are ever scared. This does not really work at this level, but the cast is doing its best and the film does not go on one of those happy endings. The story revolves around an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book with his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the US consulate, helps them find a house he lives in and finds a haunted house. About 140 years ago in the same house, Samurai found his wife beat him and kill them both and then commit suicide. Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when Fletcher arrives it does not take long before the strange things begin. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit Fletcher's bodies and begin to act like the Japanese people they were before and Laura began courting Alex leading to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted begins to act more sternly and, after pouring soup into Amy's throat, asks for help from the monk. Unfortunately, the ghosts get Ted, Laura and Alex to get rid of their death scene, as happened 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good television director but has made horror films and science fiction before and worked with McClure on some of them. While this never comes close to the atmosphere being scary or growing, there are two things that are impressed by it. First, do not contain one of those naive endings adopted by the couple after defeating demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody battle where all surrender to evil evil. Second, her Susan George is in the team! I've always been a fan of her, although she often appears, although her performance has always been top notch. She usually appears naked and does it here in two separate venues. Although she does not have classic features, she has a unique, form-like girl, one of the reasons she is so popular. But after appearing in silly films like this, I think this led to her leaving work or working only sporadically. This is not a bad film, but it never convinces and sees the ghosts they breathe when the monk gives a practical parcel worth laughing or two. The bottom line is that this is ridiculous and I hope George decides to resume her career.
