Almost every detail in this film is illogical and unreasonable. Has no appearance of a true human story, dead and dull. It's a parody of Hollywood, with little music reminding you of Denzel Washington, the shaky and focused camera shots, racist stereotypes, unnecessary and comedic footage and references from celebrities. It is made to meet the needs of many zombies who derive their interest in life from watching celebrity names. The only good thing in the film is the final credits and the accompanying funky song. I feel foolish to watch this, save yourself.
