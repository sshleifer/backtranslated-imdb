Well another movie bought me and Joe Swatman. Well, this is not the worst film I've reviewed this week, but it's still full. We enjoyed watching this piece of waste. <br /> <br /> The Monster Jigsaw is a mix of all the dysfunctional ideas of students, only known to the problem when someone is equipped with a noisy puzzle and a saw for the gun, the film was not as harsh as we had hoped, I mean the deaths of a heart attack. Again, I think that the sucker, the total actors must be porn stars and that one enter her underwear for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, it leaves the door open for part of the Jigsaw 2 game, but that will never happen to face it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br/> <br /> Funny 4/100 fake (how much fun was making fun of it) 73/100 acting 8/100 Overall 12/100
