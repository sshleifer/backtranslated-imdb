A cheap exploitation film searches for mothers about her daughter who was kidnapped by people who make illegal pornographic movies. She leads the mother march all over Europe looking for her child, and we in the public struggle to stay asleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of countless soft-grained films that are produced for people who want the thrill of porn out with the stigma or risk of appearing on their credit card bill. I personally prefer the stigma because these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. This is supposed to be an exciting film but it is not. Most talk about the things that a lot of walking takes from one place to another and lead to bullets. Periodically during the film, many people are exposed to take off their clothes and everything has more than just a touch of S & M to the procedures. Violence and vulgar material that makes you laugh more than horror or even excitement, all of this is incredibly fake. Worse still, there is not enough nudity to keep it fun. (Mainly for the course of many of these films) <br /> <br /> You will forgive for my lack of detail, but it is simply a dull boring film that I stayed with until the end in the hope that something elusive would happen, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the blonde haired blonde with a huge bite on and the size of Buick's nose. I've seen her with a satisfying mascot asking her shape as a little girl and wondering if she has had plastic surgery, not the kind of things she should think of in an impressive film. <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
