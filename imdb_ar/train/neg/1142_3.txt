I was cheated and beaten while giving my rough details about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals"! Now another breed comes in a rediscovery of disappointing: ninja movies! Many of those who have seen them before, let me tell you, they are not all that cracked! They usually do not stick to this point. This, among other things, suffers from lack of authenticity! What is the relationship between ninja and the prevention of a nuclear holocaust in Russia? Is not this supposed to be a "martial art" too? Does it seem a lot of shooting like an incredible motion movie for you? Is blood the first reason to love this death? Are you wasting some of your hard earned money on a lady singing at the top of her tank? The answers to these important questions are in The NINJA MISSION, which must be in the Martial Arts section of your video store. For more fun of ninja, try checking out the Godfrey Ho movies offered by Trans World. You get what you deserve, and this is a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
