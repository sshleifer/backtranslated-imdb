The writer and director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man, recently widowed, and learned in the past three weeks that he was HIV-positive; he was tracking the only homosexual partner he ever had, took him to an apartment and linked him, Blood tests on men and bloody retaliation if results are positive. The exciting idea on paper looks better than it seems. James Marsden's prisoner is a naive and realistic realist, but the artificial behaviors of the actor are worrying - it's like watching a promotional copy of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the most challenging role, but turning his character from a timid man to a hijacker on the edge is not convincing, as are talks between the two men. A gay Marcin boy is indifferent, of course - he is sympathetic to Speedman's plight - but he does not react or act in the way any man like me behaves in this case. The film is not a copy of the film, but it is exactly a scam, which has been hampered by bad editing, weak past memories, low budget production, and the big end result of silly appearances and melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
