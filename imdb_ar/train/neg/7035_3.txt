The very "plot" of the satanic rites or some of these jumbo mummies provide a hokey excuse for threading copious amounts of sex scenes together. Straight vanilla sex, masturbation, Lesbian, S & M, Beef, Incest, and a few other sexual spread, all this highlights the spotlight here. The problem is that the story is so boring that rampant sexual life becomes very dull after a moment. Who knew that a movie with a goat / girl meeting could be very boring? Well, I'm doing now. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows all; Helga Line offers T & A (both shown repeatedly); <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras # 1 for the region: Pick Up, Legend of Eight Samurai, No, answer the phone and Prime Evil "and" Sister Street Fighter "(and also that the same DVD carries another movie" Evil Eye ")
