The Romer case does not help that Saiberberg came a few years later and did a very good job on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this film did not work "does not seem trivial when it appears, without a syberberg movie to compare it to, which may have been filmed on a smaller audio theater with less resources." I can not remember right now whether there are horses The only thing I know is that the German version is pure magic, while this version is similar to a documentary film production for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> Music ... music ... do not add it here on IMDb ... but someone based on it in the broadcast of the twelfth and fourteenth centuries "or anything ... well, it is not a great help for the film. It comes as unreal and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> Romer is one of those French authors who love his leading men in general is very unattractive, and that does not help things. I was happy to think of something like watching syberberg on the video, and I remember that the last time I saw the movie in the theater The print was so bad that the experience was a huge 5-hour farce, but even so, it would have to go beyond what this version offers, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but ... this movie simply needs beau-coup more dollars. It does not look like a medieval manuscript, it seems to be a chibi! The march of Bonn !! Oh, yes, it ends very arbitrarily when Parsifal goes to the church, this emotional game is cut cheese ... Blah!
