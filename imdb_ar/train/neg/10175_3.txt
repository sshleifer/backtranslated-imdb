I can not go to sleep the other night. I woke up, turned on the tube and this movie was turned on. <br /> <br /> Movie makers are more worried than they can chew. Just like ambition in a range like Forrest Gump was. But Qurum read like a fairy tale where a very lucky man guides us through this era. TGMB only relies on the tired cliches of the story. Much like Broadway music where actors have to raise it. The purpose of each character was to fill out a prototype for 60 ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Learn how to present a cup: hug for his black server and get a framed picture of MLK. Crimea, talk about heavy. Why not just give him a T-shirt saying "I'm Hart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Is not love free, man? Oh no, I did not have my period." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not the UCLA box in Los Angeles." Ah, allow me? There was no box around Los Angeles in the 1960s. Instead of taking the time to show what made Berkeley unique, we would hear this naughty when not going there. <br /> <br /> We can not even remember the name of the black child. It was just a pillar used to show the ethnic tolerance of other children. <br /> <br /> The thing is that artifacts do not have to be cheese. Take "in a state of dazed and puzzled." Look at how we met the football hero, Randall Floyd. We do not see him first in the football field. In fact, we do not see him playing football. We've known him in class, and invite his fellow Indians to a poker party. <br /> <br /> "Angry" femininity is not a minor byproduct of some chick. It is much more membership and more dangerous than that. It was improved in the ladies' room because of a discussion about Gilligan Island. Serious thoughts can grow in more regular settings. But real life like it. <br /> <br /> Some warm comments here indicate that the features in this film are still relevant. I agree! This is why I am very disappointed with this piece of Burjal Borjal Borostalgia.
