This must be by far the worst film in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I thought he could not have a very bad film because he was in some decent movies and was a fair actor. Error! No one should waste their time in this movie. I quickly sent over 80% of it and did not feel like I missed something.
