This does not dampen the depths of Creepshow 3, but it is approaching. It also uses the same method of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the science of anthology, which distracts attention to the least. <br /> <br /> It is also very annoying off the twilight zone (with a bookshop) similar to the Lirling at a later night show). Unfortunately, producers and writers have forgotten that Seraling will build empathy with his characters before messing around. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last part. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West ... Well, it's the same. He does not go to Bruce Wayne / Batman in the 1960s, but he seldom does. He simply plays "Jay," which is not particularly ambiguous (there is an ominous, chilling name in the spine to compare with the likes of Dr. Terror, Aramus, and Cryptkeeper), and some mildly creepy words. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Rod Searling was seen as "Stop at Willoughby"? Then I saw this. The red herring is presented by Nutso's wife without any purpose, but even the main personal friend identifies him as cheating. As expected, but fundamentally inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminds us of various travel stories at the time of Serling, mixed with Steve Allen's "Meet the Minds". Most actors are not very bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius, who can walk, talk and even breath awkwardly), and the idea is somewhat interesting. But like Abernathy, it does not go anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, little spread (who will not?), And why it ends up being banished to nuclear arid land. <br /> <br /> Restoring life: Not a bad little piece, and I managed to control both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose he says something fascinated by the magical properties of the remote controls. The main character is mildly sympathetic. There is nothing very innovative here, but it is fine. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see the twisting spans a mile but like the main character, it has some heart and is a decent story of defeat and salvation. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: So ... why do people end up in cold storage with lame silver suits? I do not know or make sense. So ... all the supporters wandered into the library and became trapped? Kinda undermines a happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the guy died in the first part. How was he trapped? Did he visit the library before his death, and was trapped and ... did not die? What? Hey? I think this is not expected to be logical because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically no different from the newer Twilight Zone series or some fairy tales from Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and a part of a second are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
