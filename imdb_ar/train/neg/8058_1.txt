After watching Eliza Dushko hot in the wrong turn well, she decided to choose this movie instead of the film "Return of the Living Dead" for all the films. We have not seen it yet, but since it's one of the most thrilling horror films ever, it's safe to say that I made the wrong decision. There's nothing I recommend for this film, and I'm talking about the supposed killer that's superior. She did not even have a young sexual appeal from average to poor movies like I know what she did last summer or Valentine's Day or Urban Legend. It is simply meaningless, does not carry any excitement, and has very little erotic or impressive writing. The release date seems to have been postponed several times for almost a year, and the reason is obvious. The entire movie is displayed with a group of stale scenes that are grouped together randomly, into a meaningless effect. Get the wrong run instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and with her high-temperature Elizabeth Harnois - but I do not think that would have made this film a spectacle. Casey Affleck, very promising in Good Good Hunting, is appalling here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. That's enough in this one.
