The beginning of this film is excellent with a huge voice and some nice humor, but once the film turns into an animation, it loses its attractiveness quickly. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for this, at least for me, is that the colors in many animations are very muted, with little variation. Do not look good, at least on the VHS. It explodes every now and then and looks wonderful, but not too often, the characters come and go very quickly. For example, I wanted to see more of "Moby Dick". When the film begins to drag, it thrives again at the entrance of the dragon and then the movie ends strongly. <br /> <br /> In general, do not forget enough or be able to compete with great animated films in the last ten years.
