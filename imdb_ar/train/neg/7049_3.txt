The only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. For viewers who like to browse this movie, it would be a huge disappointment because the total number of minutes of skiing is struggling to reach three. <br /> <br /> The story is a slice of life around beach surfers who are waiting for no perfect wave, but for any wave at all. JC (Sean Pertoy) is an aging surfer who flirts with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find great grace with the woman he loves, three of his old friends come to ride the waves and convince him to hit the beach in search of the monster waves in Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the film, so most of the story is lost in a succession of separate beach events. <br /> <br /> The representation is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertoy has a few comedic moments, but mostly he was a worldly representation. Ewan McGregor was fit as a man who traded in the drug trade, and is the most interesting and exotic character in this group. Peter Jen may have performed the most in Terry's role, which transformed his majestic body into a continuous blindness. Catherine Zeta-Jones was as exciting as usual, but her character did not have enough meat to show a great deal of acting ability. <br /> <br /> There is not much to comment here. I rated them 3/10. It's a real beach problem.
