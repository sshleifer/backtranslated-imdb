I thought this was a very illogical version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles and gave their characters some personal character. But the whole thing felt forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning might involve a lot; perhaps starting with an exchange of fire, then coming back to the conclusion of how they got there or that sort of thing. I felt that every scene was routinely expected and foreseen, like very bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to this movie, and I hope there is something much better. The only thing I can say for him is that he beats Mick Jagger, but not much.
