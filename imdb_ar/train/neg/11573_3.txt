I came here to review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of him, and those that I found made it seem unacceptable. How you feel misleading! <br /> <br /> First, you should point out that this is a homemaker movie during the day. The performances are wooden, each phrase is an attempt to "impress" in the way that housewives and soap operas are always bad, based on this predictable and well-known premise that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. The entire film revolves around the "drama" at moments when male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this sounds acceptable (or even fun), beware. But Linda Hamilton's German accent, though very good, draws attention painfully - like her face, for some reason. There is no doubt that the other shows are a constant source of embarrassment for the perpetrators, with the subtle and painful descriptions being the order of the day. There are some surprises, but watch "Monty Pythonesque" of endless food and drink that miraculously appears from the bags of hungry soldiers! "<br /> <br /> I did not expect any action, but I hoped it was pretty, textual or charged Emotionally, what I got was the story of a "good feeling" at Christmas that was so bad that you would see a smart crowd wrestling with all of this. <br /> <br /> Watch it under the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. Predictable "housewives" who face men and win TV movies The only way you can appreciate a real story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. T enough emotions so that you move your emotions easily through storytelling is complex.
