Carrie Fisher said on more than one occasion that she made the film during her lifetime when she was suffering from a severe cocaine problem, and she did not remember much. This would explain why she did this film, but it does not explain why anyone else in the crew or crew; I can not believe that everyone has a coke problem. This must be one of the worst films ever released, and that's something to say. You can not put the blame on the feet of the director Tim Kincaid or the writer Bodi Giovinazo, because it is clear that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. It is obvious that it may be gathered automatically, as there is no evidence of coherence, consistency, design, plot, logic, intelligence, or anything else. What is really amazing is the presence of some of the actual professionals who participated in this game. Co-star Robert Joy has done well in other films, and composer Jimmy Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both veterans of the industry, and Marx was a way out, not bad. Why are they implicated in the steaming pile of these viscera? Tim Kincaid, the so-called "director", has done quite a few science fiction and horror movies, and after seeing most of them, I can tell you that there is nothing good. This, however, is the worst thing he has ever done, and this is a great achievement on his part. Everything, everything at all, about this movie is rate 12 - at best. Terrible cinematography, laughable acting, "special effects" make "Plan 9 of outer space" look like "Spider-Man", and the story is vulgar, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time even when looking at the lid of the video box, let alone renting it. A complete, absolute, annoying, total dud.
