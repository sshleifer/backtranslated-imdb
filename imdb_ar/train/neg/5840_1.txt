OK then. I've just watched a huge number of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not sure which one I wanted to review first. Then he hit me like a rat bag: Rodentz. People warn about Rodentz. This beast has no star and is dull and painful to sit. It's about mutant mice killing people. Yes ... the real 'dotted' original. "Food of the gods", or "Willard" anyone? It was better than that, and that does not mean much ... <br /> <br /> ** Possible SPOILER ** Well, here's the story: Ina the world lab and his beloved assistant Experimenting mice and their laboratory in the neighborhood of Kribi and the crappy building and the obsessed friends of the beloved assistant are showing Drunk and everyone becomes a food for crazy rats and almost everyone dies, Oh, there is a giant one rat seems to be painful, but it kills, the end. There, all in one sentence! The spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! The second, which we all know is that there is a giant mouse, we all know that it will eventually be destroyed !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here are the details: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I've seen it for free, but to anyone else ... Hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> You did not hurt her, and did not help: <br /> <br /> - Um ... well. It was Al Gore. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> - CG-type mice are not as bad as in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - .. In other shots, CG rats are pathetically cheap. See, if your movie has a low budget, it may not be CG-based. Lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> - The representation is very poor. <br /> <br /> - Characters are out of interest - we have a mix of cliches and none of them do a good job. <br /> <br /> --Boooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Been done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - A stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The giant rat looks like a fat man in a poorly conceived teddy bear - it was funny - but not funny enough to give the film any value. <br /> <br /> - A fickle, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All students of Zhao Rat University drink Tequila people from huge plastic milk jugs - yet they do not seem to be drunk for longer than a few seconds. A way to stick to continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply awful. Worse than you imagine. It is not so bad as "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now those nonsense movies you can enjoy. Even if they do something that makes you stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - The end of the lame motion movie, complete with uninvited and explosive heroes. Because he did not feel at all like the rest of this beast - but he was still absorbed. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinema: 4/10 Character development: 0/10 Special effects / Make-up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexual activity: 1 / (I used to go to my son sometimes during the film, so I might miss it, but I suppose I was there) 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average time) Writing: 1/10 Output: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> In general: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you love horror movies based on Mice and insects. Wait ... Check it out. Do not see it. It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
