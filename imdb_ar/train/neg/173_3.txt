The sequel is decent, but does not pack the original punch. The killer screenwriter (Judd Nelson) assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel Cabine by the Lake. Murder is ruthless, but the film seems to have tongue in cheek. No teaser is not funny kind. The Total project seems to be of high quality and at times Nelson is at the forefront. This movie rotates around a script that is rewritten before going to the screen ... This should have happened to this script.
