Jane Hackman gets himself out of jail by a government agency with no name and wants to kill him. It is recognized, of course, that Hackman possesses the skills of this position. <br /> <br /> No one tells him anything, he has been given because the public has received bits and pieces of information. This is supposed to be suspicious, instead it is annoying and tedious. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes on a mission, but the smuggler disappears and orders the man at the top of this mysterious entity every dead person to cover him up. So everyone dies in the team, and in the end do not really care. <br /> <br /> One of the reviewers pointed out that the film was originally about twice as long, about three hours long, and was cut slightly. Something may have been lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was a pity for the public. <br /> <br /> Very talented actors who attended people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Ellie Wallach and Edward Albert are completely wasted here as a crime. <br /> <br /> We have never found out what the FBI does in all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA, or even the IRS.
