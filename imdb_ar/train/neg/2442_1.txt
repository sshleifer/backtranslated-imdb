I do not know why I keep doing it myself !! I still continue to defend Dutch and Belgian cinema and I claim that you should get more credit and opportunities ... and then they mess around your head with such an unwanted! Intensive care is a terrible production and perhaps the worst thing done in the Dutch-speaking countries. It is a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, which is clearly based on the major American distressed classics such as Friday 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers were very much aiming to achieve this goal, but they have already fallen. Intensive Care has become an embarrassing product for everyone who has participated, and thus flickered away from the true worship here. It is almost impossible to find an original version of this and is only displayed on special occasions, such as "Night of Distaste". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a ground map ... then turn into a lame oblique movie and cut his brain with awesome effects - but funny and very cheap - make up effects. The representation of representatives in full is abhorrent, although there are few respected names. Plays the leading role of men by Koen Wauters ... This man may be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, TV host and idol of many young girls. Never mentioned this thing in which he starred. Like anyone else in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince himself that there has been no focused attention.
