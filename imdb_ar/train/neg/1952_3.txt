Scott Minville is not Cassie Kassem. This is the first and most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to recreate the imagination of Scooby-Doo and the company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice squeaks and does not seem anything like him at any time the previous incarnation of Scooby's shows. They also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on with the villain's angle so far, but it certainly does not follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby programs. <br /> <br /> The cartoon pattern is very strange and distorted. I love it, but it is not a real Scooby Doo cartoon type. But the strange animations used in other WB shows have grown on me; this may also be. <br /> <br /> It's worth a quick look - once - if you can handle the lack of a proper shaggy sound. There is enough to bring one to enjoy the show correctly. Besides, I try not to be a fan of flexibility. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. We will see how he takes care of two more rings - by then I will have formed a firmer opinion.
