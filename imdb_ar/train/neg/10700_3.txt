The film revolves around Sir Christopher Strong (a member of parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his relationship with Amelia Earhart's character, which is similar to that of Katharine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very loyal husband, but when Hepburn met the exotic but brilliant, "he could not help himself" and fell in love. You can say, because they stare a lot at the space and talk about how painful their unwanted love is. Frankly, this is an awesome dated film and practically impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that in the days before the code, movies were charming adultery very common. In addition, even if this morally questionable subject is accepted, the complete silence of the dialogue makes it look like a romantic novel in the 19th century ... and really bad in that. The viscosity and hard characters (after all, Clive's wife is a nice lady and did not hurt anyone) make this person a big waste of time. About the only interesting aspect of this film is the outfit worn by Hepburn in an early scene where he wears a moth costume! You should see it incredible - it looks like one of the Bugaloos (vague, but appropriate sign).
