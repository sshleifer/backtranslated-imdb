After reading the book, which made great sense to me, the film did not give me anything of the feeling conveyed by the book. This makes me wonder if Kaufman likes this book because he managed to turn it into something else. Either this or it is simply bad. More importantly, where is the lightness ?! From the first scene, the music drowns most dialogue and feeling, and this continues through the film directly. I think the producers thought that by playing upbeat music directly through the film, this would make the story feel light - but they failed quite well here. Instead, the music was able to give everything that looked like the film, in a way that excited the events so that we could stick to them, so that everything was really heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this adaptation fails is to decorate the story line which makes it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz passing Thomas on the street, on his way to see Sabina. The presentation of this opportunity / meeting, which certainly did not occur in the book, gives the story of Thomas more importance than it makes it light up. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, and more importantly for the worst, but perhaps it has been because the book simply does not turn into a good movie, like the Condera style. This makes us wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site are writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than just writing about the film. Film length is not convincing. For those who have not read the book yet, I recommend reading it. For those who have, you must say that you will waste your time and you may end up writing similar clear warnings.
