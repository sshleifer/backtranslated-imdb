When I watched this last night, it surprised me that Fox spent a lot of money on it and recovered a little of its investment. It is the kind of catastrophe that must be believed. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch has been covered on the shelf above her stove to prepare a spot for an Oscar will surely win this original bold film. The face of the girl. That was not what happened. <br /> <br /> The controversy over the collection was detailed in the printback by Rex Reed, which helped the film achieve a reputation before it was released. When it was finally released, there were no usual three propaganda circles. If I remember correctly, I opened in Houston at nearby car parks and theaters and did not play any of the big places. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame has been placed on director Michael Sarn, who was hot after "Not All That Good" directed Joanna, a film with music about youth at the Department of Defense in London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox ended up shooting him and bringing the movie together as best they could. For this reason the viewer is played in any particular sequence and the characters appear and disappear. An impressive support team (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Bacos, John Carradine, Andy Devine, and others) misses nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend it to length, there are many sections of Fox films that show stars such as Carmen Miranda (in amazing footage from a gang all here) and Laurel and Hardy, who never dreamed they would work in a movie rated X . <br /> <br /> X is the language of many sexual anomalies; however, none of the characters seem to have fun. Perhaps someone involved in the film had a distorted burritan feeling and found that if they could make these things unattractive, it was not bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the "young people" that almost went bankrupt in Hollywood in 1970. One writer jokingly said that EASY RIDER (created for pocket change) was the most expensive film ever produced because many movies Which followed and tried and failed in the worst way to replicate its success. At the age of 60, former directors such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger have made films like RPM and SKIDOO in an attempt to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to produce films to attract a black audience. These films are locked somewhere in the basement and two of his name and many other films of this genre have never been, to my knowledge, outside the home video or cable. It is the mystery of the deep darkness of the studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this is, all the things that have been considered, very good. With the right direction and scenario, she could play a kind of distinguished women liberals, Roseland Russell and Barbara Stanwyck, looking pretty much and having a great fashion. Mae West is the most energetic and seventy actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is sad to see her attempt to capture her glory from past years, but I am sure she needs the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great budget rating on X movie of this era see "Beyond the Valley" (also from Fox) because it does not take itself seriously. He's crazy kids playing equipment in a big studio. MERA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. No one wanted to listen.
