This sad little movie is little like the revival of Broadway in 1971, which was a great success. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed this revival, he rewritten it widely. I have a feeling that this screenwriter has made a lot of change over the original 1925 version as well. I played the play "Innocent Filler" by Jimmy Smith on stage in 1974, and I think this DVD $ 1 will bring back memories. Not an opportunity. Even the expected joy of seeing the play "Topper" Roland Young "for my role" was a big disappointment. Three songs remain from the play, and are performed very badly. Even the classic duo, "Tea For Two", is made as a default solo. The many familiar faces of this failure in 1940 are not proud of it at all, and the star, Anna Nigel, embarrass herself. When I feel bad about spending the dollar, I know that the movie should be bad. Commentator Doris Day, actually called "Tea For Two," is about the play (the original version of course), so those seeking "No No Nanette" may find a more famous version there.
