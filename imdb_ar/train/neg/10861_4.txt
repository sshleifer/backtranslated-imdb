Maybe I miss something because I read more positive things about "the guy who fooled himself" than I read bad reviews - and I do not understand them. I like to have a little style with characters who speak, look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this film have this style or presence or anything you want to name. Take the lead actor, Le Jie Cobb. His isolated circular view outside the house seems far from the original, stunning, soft shape. Or, take Jane White as another actress. This is one of the worst abortions I've seen in a while. She is not convinced of the role. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new to this genre. I was expecting the results of the man who tricked himself after about five minutes. This last chase scene of the cat and mouse is boring plain old. From ten to fifteen minutes of not having anything really ruined any skipping of the film.
