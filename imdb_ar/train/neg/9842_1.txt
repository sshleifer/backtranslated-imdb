It seems that everyone in this film directs Woody Allen. They fail and stop and fail more. Only fans of DeNero really hardcore! He tries to appear as an ardent and artistic - but it sounds like a very low budget film produced by very college students. The most frequently used word in the whole film is "hum". The film connects the atmosphere of the late 1960s / early 1970s. If you like movies where people always talk about each other, the terrible lighting (even if it's "for art") makes you feel like you're sitting in a lame political meeting, you might want to - but you need to be really bored. I found this CD in the dollar box and now I know why.
