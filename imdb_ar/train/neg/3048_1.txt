Perhaps the most spectacular display of Santa Claus is committed to any means, be it a book, a picture or a film. Santa looks like she is looking at the children and the twisted story to bring Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's disciples, Pitch, do not make things better. It's funny to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959. If there was a kid to watch this movie, he would have nightmares and would not want to visit Santa. Scars will last a lifetime. Imagine a child in the "Christmas Story" when he starts yelling after putting him in the lap of Santa. This will change if the child sees this movie.
