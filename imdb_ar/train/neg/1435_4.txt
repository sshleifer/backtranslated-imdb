This film was produced in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parkes and brought the world back to the rest of Wild West Canada. When Archie began to write his stories for the papers, the idea of ​​the day was to tame the wild and transform / assimilate the nation's first peoples. <br /> <br /> The film asks the question: Why does a well-educated, talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> When an English boy dreams of becoming something but understanding the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - it does not matter what it is. It seems that the story of the famous brides is not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie as a vivid image of "Cigar store Indian", a very wooden character that is not real at all - well behaved by Mr. Brosnan. He also filmed the wild Indian in the dance scene of the tourist. The fullness and / or the truth did not materialize until he met his wife Annie and married her. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would lead him to the top of the world stage for Englishman, not as himself but Gray Owl - a Canadian citizen of the land border. <br /> <br /> This is as close as you can get from Archie to become a noble savage prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's explanation as well as board members are well done. I've seen documentary films about Gray Owl and I think this is a good movie on the big screen to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie would meet with the tribal elders' council was a wonderful moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Canadian Lake Views and True Gray Owl Sites. <br /> <br />
