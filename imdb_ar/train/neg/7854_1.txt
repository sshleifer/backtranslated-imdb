Wow this is the worst movie ever. The only reason that prompted me to subscribe to IMDb is to complain about this movie. I never went out of the theater or stopped the DVD, but I stopped this almost one (and I must have). But I saw him all the way to the end just to come down again with a very terrible end. Wow if this is all that craven can produce its long time. I have never seen and will never see it. Behaving terribly with an awesome plot. Hey someone seems to shine a mirror in us lets you check it out. The sad part is that when this movie came to DVD it was fully examined in a blockbuster forever. So I feel upset for all the people who saw this junk.
