This film absorbs from start to finish (especially). Probably not getting worse, representation, narration, photography, camera work, etc. is very bad, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that's what makes them a "fantastic" watch, they'll give you more than good enough laughter. Worst, the best! <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people were thinking about making this film. Serious Viking film? The story is ridiculous, it's like a disguised comedy, like the Munchia Mafia, useless but funny damn. <br /> <br /> Looking for the end of the film ... Ahom.
