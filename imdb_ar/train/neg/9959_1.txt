Cheap manipulation. This film has no heart. <br /> <br /> He also got a terrible dialogue, unconcerned characters, and a story that is either wrong or somewhat absent. It only fades from bad to worse in a silly attempt to relieve some kind of passion from the unfaithful and unprofessional hysterics! <br /> <br /> The hedgehog !!!! By the way, the Hedgehog made the most convincing and distinctive show in this 90-minute hustle and bustle. <br /> <br /> If you've thought about watching this movie, do not. I'm sorry but I can not find a single recovery feature for this movie. Big ZERO scores, fat with me. Precisely for sub-dogma knicker-wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you love dancing in the dark ... <br /> <br />
