I saw this film at the New York Gay Festival and thought it was so bad. The first and most distraction is the way it was shot, that is, there is a lot of slow motion and extreme excerpts that seem to be meaningless - a wise or aesthetic story - other than showing the skills of the cinematographer (who I think is the director too) The film plaintiff. The main actor (Sam Levin) was very nice, but he was a mediocre actor at best; the rest of the cast ranged from bad to bad. The story itself was often unpredictably predictable. I must admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but I hated it so much.
