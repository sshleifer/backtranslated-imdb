How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with the killer in the ripoff scream mask? The Bleed plot is somewhat original but the movie itself fails completely. For one reason, the dialogue is weak, boring, and wasting a lot of time on simple details, bad representation and so on. I want to recover my money, this rent stinks worse than the skunk.
