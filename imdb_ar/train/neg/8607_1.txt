<br /> <br /> The movie "Mollusks" is unique because the margins are actually good people in this terrible story of nature. You see, these poor mollusks have been transformed by the pollution of evil humans and do not mean to do anything harmful. They are just molluscs with sharp teeth that eat flesh and excrete poison, but mollusks are no less. The real bad guys are human beings, who are actively trying to destroy our favorite spots, or overreacting when confronted. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the man on the glove is full of mollusks. They were hanging in a comfortable glove when this giant hand came out of nowhere, instinctively reacting, defending themselves and grooming the man. Now, instead of looking for medical care for the snail bite, this man runs around a greenhouse screaming like a fool, pouring some highly volatile chemicals, shooting, knocking a bookcase on himself, cutting off his hand and then shooting and mixing volatile chemicals and exploding his house. How can you blame the mollusks? <br /> <br /> This film paints a picture of a less favorable person. The characters in this film include the mute mayor who hates everyone, the drunken father his dog means, and the dogmatic owner whose wife is 45 years older than him. There is also a group of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> who are attacked during assembly, and we have to see slim, long-haired genitals. Meanwhile, there is a man who looks like a demonic Leslie Nelson who yells "You do not have the power to declare a happy birthday!" for some reason. Finally, a man from the classic "Pod People" group of MST3K gathers this display of hatred that blows his face after taking the power of the ligaments (another fate can easily be avoided and blamed on useful and harmless molluscs). <br /> <br /> Human beings are depicted as greedy, stupid, racist, addicted to alcohol, and in one senseless scene as potential rapists. In the movie scene, evil humans try to burn the molluscs who cry helplessly in the sewers, well, because they are stupid, human beings succeed in blowing up the whole town. They alone cause more damage than the mollusks! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans, I know I'm doing it, you'll appreciate the "mollusk". If you are a fan of bad cinema, this festival will appreciate the director of "The Cut" and "The People's Podcast". There is enough bad representation, silly dialogue, irrational plot transformations, lame special effects, useless scenes, and poor dubbing to attract your attention.
