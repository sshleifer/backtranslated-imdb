RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer as a TV show host named Jerry, but it is not JERRY SPRINGER, his guests are the trash, but not the trash you get at THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack each other, but they do not like on ..... What is the purpose of making a film about the JERRY SPRINGER display and pretending it is not a JERRY SPRINGER display? Moreover, this film is very boring
