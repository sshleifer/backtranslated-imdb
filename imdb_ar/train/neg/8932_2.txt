I must say that I was very curious to watch this film and was considered a notorious disaster when it was released in the 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also appeared on many critics of bad films, and this has increased the depth of attention, I see what made this film so bad. Until I see him, I think I have my answers. Although I will say that it makes viewing strange, the acting, direction and scenario is so bad that the supposed laugh is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex change, the film goes down the hill so that it can not carry it alone. Johnston is certainly in the role of Uncle Buck Lunner who has no help, because he licks and hates the screen, and sometimes he seems to be wondering what he is doing there. Rex Reed excels in the role of Myron, the changing ego of Myra, and even his famous scene of masturbation. Bravo's premieres! Farah Fawcett plays dumb blonde. She certainly seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, arguably the most famous role went to May West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face that makes sex gestures seems more appropriate for a horror film. I do not mean to put this in person; but in this film, no one comes out well. The trend seems uncertain and nonexistent, so much so that the film is not only bad but also boring. Get rid of some old movie footage of old stars, and the movie will become more intermittent. To everyone who has anyone who enjoys this, I was happy to see him at least, but Mira Breckenridge seems to be the disaster he has always been hearing from the start.
