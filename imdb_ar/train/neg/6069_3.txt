Do not stop at my surprise how you can take a great actor, and put it in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but he could not save it. In fact, his character is very similar to the character he played in Cape Fear, which was actually good, but I can not stand when actors on the same chic are doing more than one film. I think it has become old, and that is the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising about this film, but then, the story was told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and shows his concept in his characterization. De Niro plays demented fans, but his role in this film is less than entertainment. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro is in this movie, making it a draw if you are a fan (not pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at his best, see Midnight Run, Goodfellas, Cop Land, or even go back and check out Taxi Driver or Godfather II. Do not waste your time with this driving kit. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
