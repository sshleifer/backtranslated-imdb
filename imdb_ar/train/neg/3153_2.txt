I am a sucker for good romance, but this one can not be considered either good or romantic. I had the plot nailed down before the credits passed. With this weak dialogue, developing plot and characters, I suggest investing your watch and a half elsewhere. I had to hurry to hire a coincidence for the third time so I could taste this bad taste from my mouth.
