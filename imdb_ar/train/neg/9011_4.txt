Very beautiful B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone watching "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a group of people making their first film should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies are available to reformulate common formats. If you give them a symbolic analysis, you end up sabotaging the movie for you (and maybe write some self-critical reviews on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the introduction of the female, Christine Byers. She had the charisma and I think she was remarkably attractive. The B-movie appearance was memorable. Unfortunately, I do not see where any movies have been produced since. I will watch her again.
