Strangely, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Is it because of 1975 and has Chamberlain and Kurtz in it, and thus repeatedly forgave the poor ways in the novel? <br /> <br /> Maybe that's because some people sympathize with this movie because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think that's a problem, filmmakers never assume that viewers read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because of my irrational anger at the fact that the English-speaking actors are trying to act like their French counterparts?
