Cut to the chase, this is one of the worst five movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> They did not try it. There was some decent writing with some elements of the structure there, a good team, some good acting. I'm not sure where the error happened, but the error was terrible. <br /> <br /> Some elements may be a bad structure and not an objective story, a lot of overestimation (probably a lot better when restraint), some bad guidance and editing. I had enough in about an hour, tearing my hair in about an hour and a half and very enthusiasm in an hour and fifty minutes ran. There was also sincerity about everything, since I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was furious that he had ridiculed something that was not useful to him. The 17-year-old girl was in love with a 30-year-old drug addict. <br /> <br /> The hectic nature of the command was enough to take off. There were clunky plot points that were trying in structure, but the end result was meaningless and did not end (with unequal time lines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for quality representatives whom I had not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Skip this. I assumed that this was a way out for the first time, and he was fond of his followers, but he did it before. I'm puzzled how to find this and many really bad ideas someone will actually give them money.
