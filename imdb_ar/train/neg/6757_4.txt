Strange film of the product Charles Band. In the days of the greatest success of Full Moon, Band said he would never make "real killer films" because he felt that the little dolls and the big monsters had added a fictional element to make the films better - so the people who killed each other became real and less fun. It became a beautiful and shameful philosophy that Band, having destroyed the Full Moon studio through a lousy business deal, was so desperate to make home cinema profits that he began to achieve exactly what Blockbuster wanted, thus sacrificing creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on Delta Delta Die! And "Christmas rites" - both equally nice by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is in his best form here as a novice to a gang of men and people who have decided to form a story about the "murder club". She, as one might think, is doing all she can to join her and then becoming panic because it was not a real and ridiculous story that Mrs. Rushon has now ratified. Everyone will have to run with blood and maybe kill each other or maybe not. The option exists, and with respect to this film, it is your own ... Not recommended but not quite bad either.
