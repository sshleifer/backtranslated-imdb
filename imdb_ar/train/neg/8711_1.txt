Well ..... this is the third in the Carnosaurus series. Lets star with dinosaur dolls! At the beginning of the film, you can not see the reason Dino when you start the physical count, you can only see the vision of Dino's eye, very smart to hide the bad dolls! Perhaps 16 minutes ahead on the film some special power team with Scott Valentine as the leader of Rance, the team enters the warehouse and then begin to find body parts and bodies after Dino's frenzy, after a while the box comes great failure in the team and you can hear the scream of Philoserptor, very !!! Then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! Raptor's hand comes out and cuts her face but if she stops when Raptor's hand comes, can you see that he's just a man holding a doll !? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Attacks by some terrorists Some trucks cause some weapons to be washed there. 2. They make mistakes in death until they are ten meters Raptor and a giant T-Rex there! How does T-Rex fit there ??? 3. Rance and some morbid will kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some of the dumb blond girl told him to catch one of them alive. (4.) The holy joseus, the raiders live with wheels on their exploits! 5. Dino is now on a boat in the Pacific 6. I did not know that t-Rex had something Strange on the neck hes ??? 7. Finish, the film is good if you want a good 5/10 laugh
