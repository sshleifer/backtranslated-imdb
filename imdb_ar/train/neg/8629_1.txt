Dear Richard, I know we all liked our home improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do not you have anything else to do besides Air Bud? I thought Tim might already give you a simple role so far or even become his personal assistant. I know this sounds ridiculous, but the benefits of wages are more useful. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Tim and immediately think of the "Time Tool". So you get roles with Bob Villa often. Instead, show up for 10 minutes with Golden Retriever and smile. I know there were not a lot of text, but you could add it. I mean come. Tim owes you one of them. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does not do anything for Air Bud. On the contrary, speaking puppies are more likely to see dogs actually exercising. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Carne, know that more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is the movie "F".
