So let me start by saying that I saw this film as part of the deal. I was really bored one day in 1997, so I went back to the movie rental shop. I asked the writer about the worst film he has in the store. Without hesitation, he took me to "Lucky Stiff". Tell me he will waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge extra) if you promised to watch the entire movie. So I saw him, I did it for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God is so awful. You do not need to go to the details of the plot and read other reviews. The jokes are meaningless. The acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You might try to watch it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not funny that way. Avoid!
