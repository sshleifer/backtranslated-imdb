Republic photos come late in the game into the "Werewolf" type Werecat. The plot involves a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad, during which he was exposed to fear that he had been exposed during a power outage. He deserves great acclaim because his novel, which parallels the notorious trial, is a best seller. The French government wants to know whether it has access to classified documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "policeman". Doubts lie to the writer when his fianc√© ends up dying. The complexity of things is the return of power cuts so the writer does not know whether he is a murderer or not. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is so exciting that it can not be enjoyed completely. There are lots of early musical numbers and lots of dead time when you talk all things in the middle and later sections. The acting is good and the groups are very good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the hated killer, it is the most interesting in this film. Despite the short time it took (just over an hour), I think the reason that this movie rarely shows on TV is that after 20 minutes it began to lose patience. As far as talking is good, I wished someone would do something. When it finally happened, in the closing minutes, it was too late .. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
