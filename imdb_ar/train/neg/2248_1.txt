This film is a massive steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone feels that the Garland / Mason version needs to be reformulated, nor why Striesand was the first choice for the star. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why our people (gay Americans) are largely inclined to consider Striesand a treasure. At least in my opinion, she has reached a professional climax with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and hire a classic Judy, or even the original movie (a wonderful movie by itself), but please, please, please, skip this stinky!
