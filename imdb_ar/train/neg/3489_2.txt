This was my first film, and probably another film Angelopoulos. I was eager to enter it, where Mastroiani, one of my favorite actors, introduced a Theo film, which I've heard a lot about. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep across the Albanian-Greek border. Okay! But that was all. There is nothing left. The film had big holes and I do not know, mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed by the old woman. During a long march. The monologue looks like 15 minutes, killing the movement and the patience of the viewers. Nothing happens on the screen for 15 or 20 minutes, except for this old lady who tells a story. Everything that is supposed to appear through work, was simply told to the old lady of the camera. At the moment, the TV equipment was heading to the bar. Run the corner and start winter immediately! Perhaps, a shot on different days, leaked continuity. There are a lot of problems with storytelling, it has moved from absurd to irrational and never stuck to a style, making the viewer ask questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given the role that lacks integrity or magic. On the other hand, as many Greeks, Albanians or Balkan people agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political errors, just to make a film about "humanity" in red in another review. There is much to be said, but there is no time to waste in a poor film, it was not a movie at all, but the madness of a person impressed in the film and paid him state money.
