This movie got only 1 because you can not give zero! If you have a weak belly at all you do not see. People have animal rights that you do not want to watch either. Makes vegetarian people swear I saw it happen! The only wonderful parts are the situation and the fact that it is a true story. It's really really creepy that this guy works at the ADT while people are killed! Still feel safe when punching in this tiny code? I do not! He had access to all code in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the movie was not scary, it was scary! Do you serve yourself and do not rent / buy this movie, I think it costs about $ 20 to make it include actors who paid too much!
