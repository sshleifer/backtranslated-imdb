He makes actors in Hollyoaks look like a Royal Shakespeare Company. This film falls in an appalling range. Turning off the DVD player is not enough to work. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face. I will not get this time. Start. How can I create a regular, tedious and tedious film? I could not think of a course of action that would ease boredom. Writing the 10 required lines is very difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema. What you can say more than to be re-emphasized is how terrifying it really is. Please avoid.
