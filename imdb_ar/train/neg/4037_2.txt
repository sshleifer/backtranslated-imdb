I have no idea what the Shield producers are trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically impossible. <br /> <br /> The offers on The Shield are supposed to be great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so poorly placed that you can not even see the shows. For example, the edit moves away from the reaction footage before it has full effect. <br /> <br /> I do not know what logic is so logical, but it takes away the entire emotional impact display. <br /> <br /> I will give The Shield one point of ambition on its subject, but that's all I can offer. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to see a number of talented people losing their gift to something badly filmed.
