My interest in Dorothy Straten caused me to buy this video. Although there are excellent representatives / representatives, there are a very large number of sub-schemes that have continued to pay attention. Plus they were not interesting. The dialogue was harsh and confusing, and the story turned so unbelievably. I was very disappointed with what I think is one of Audrey Hepburn's last films. I always love John Ritter's best in joking. It was just too pathetic here.
