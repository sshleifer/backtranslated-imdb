I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature as a way to warn others to save your money. Almost any episode of "The Human Animal" by Desmond Morris or "The Nature of Things" by David Suzuki has outperformed the material. Not only is the director failing to take advantage of the stunning 65-70mm IMAX screen and the giant display, everything on the screen is very impressive because of access to such programs. Viewers are introduced to Heather's husband, her husband, Buster, her niece and nephew. We follow them for forty endless minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, and so on. Although we provide access to the viewer within the human digestive tract and recognize the natural diving reactions of children, do we really learn anything more than most primary school graduates? Are we enjoying distance across Heather across the Atlantic? Do you care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see the IMAX feature, I suggest pictures of "India: Tiger Kingdom" beautifully filmed or technically "thrilling 3D space". Trust me.
