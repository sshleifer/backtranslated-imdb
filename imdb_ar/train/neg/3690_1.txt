Papa - Rajinikanth will not forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused him to fall. It was released with a lot of hype but crashed badly and suffered severe financial losses for producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to pay them personally for the losses incurred. Shortly after his release, he tried to enter politics but failed miserably. It's a very bad movie with terrible makeup, poor quality makeup and a pathetic script. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some diseases. I am one of the unfortunate souls that I saw Papa, the first day I first appear in the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I would not recommend this to anyone.
