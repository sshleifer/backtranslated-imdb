First, the CGI in this film was terrible. I saw him during the marathon of bad films on SciFi. In the end when the owner of the park kills, it is probably one of the worst examples of the CGI I have seen. Even Night of the Dead Dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> However, the film had no plot. Why were they on that particular island? Well, not mentioned in the film. Why do people continue to come to the cat area? Does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing that emerged in this film was fairly good acting. In what could be called "B made for movie movie," the acting was very good. Barry Chen particularly distinguished. <br /> <br /> If you do not have anything at all on Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotations.
