Nothing can save this movie, nor even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects were amazing. Better guidance may have increased the sense of performance and performance better than actors. But nothing but feed the script to a fixable dragon. Draw holes, bad lines, terrible speed, and restore endless shots of the same CGI Dragon trampling through the arcade ... Ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
