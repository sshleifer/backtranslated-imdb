What a missed opportunity to produce an interesting film about a complex subject. There is very little exploration of what it really feels like to be a straight man (or homosexual) working in a homosexual environment. Dancers continue to talk about their art as if it does not contain a sexual element. They may not all be prostitutes to hire, but they actually practice sex in fantasies and sell private sessions where more than one dance is offered. Of the film, one would have the impression that it is particularly appealing to women going to gay clubs and then ending up hiring "dancers" in private sessions. Even the footage at the club shows only women in front of the stage and "dancers" playing only in front of women in attendance. This is not the reality of these clubs. It will be very hard to earn a living doing special dances for women and couples respectively. What do they really feel about their gay fans? We learn very little. Instead we get stuffing. A gay activist adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. The manager who tells us about the costumes of the clouds works but does not give an insight into the lives and positions of the dancers. <br /> <br /> Pictures of Mexico City are public. The thorny montage that shows roasted sausages is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It is a completely streamlined film and should be of interest only to those who want to see some pictures of young children dancing. The rest of the film is an insult to gay men.
