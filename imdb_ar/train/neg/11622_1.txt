Dave passes the divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Walkthrough" is probably not the word. I would say that it focuses on the girlfriend of the past. Remember the day the relationship ended. The dream sequence lacks only blurry transformations. He fondly remembers their favorite songs and the places they went to. I am not an adviser, but perhaps this has to do with a failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a half-life lady (also an absolute), and instead of being "stopped" because of his crawling, starts to pay attention to him. Have you mentioned how creepy Dave is? Sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he walks as well. It's just curious. Make a very long story short, Dave plans to hunt down Mary (old friend) and kill her ... misses ... means confronting her. do that. Which was really creepy. He believes that her to be married, but he still flies in the middle of the country to meet her. Bet on her house to make sure she is alone, before she "drops" on her. He has an embarrassing conversation with her ending with his participation in the Gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and returns to his new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the film mostly for unintentional comedy value. I still enjoy the wife through Dave's impressions of me ... "I heard Dave's song and another Mary!"
