Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A long time guest (Corobet) is being transferred to a stricter prison Of the reopening of Alcatraz. He claims to be closer to his mistress but his real motives are a little greater. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg), a huge prisoner who can take care of himself. The twitch, despite being less muscular, is the same mouth which is pretty much the same. But there is a guerrilla war brewing between black and Latin prisoners who explode in a hostile takeover of the prison when the leader of the black bandits is shot dead and finger points in Burke. But it does not really hit the fan when the real killer and the leader of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid), the wife of Twitch and the daughter of Burke are taken hostage. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal does not arrange. Opposes the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agrees to do so, provided that the film company he was working with at the time is allowed to direct his own film (so although it is a DVD sequel, the main role this time goes to Bill Golberg) Stock footage from the first film that appears near the end). But there is a reason why he has not done much work since Universal Soldier 2 because not many actors, not much of the star of the movement, are a personal management that starts out as very dark, but is no doubt transformed into a standard movement hero who errs awkwardly unilaterally. Wise support, old warriors from the first film, Corobet and Tony Blana, have just jumped the chance of overtime. <br /> <br /> This movie tried to copy its original style well, with low light, dark shadows and much more playing rap. She does it well, unfortunately, she can not face an unshakeable hero, a villain of equal cardboard and an indifferent story that its makers seem to have done so much in the past. **
