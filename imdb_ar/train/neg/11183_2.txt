"People I Know" is a veteran man who has no one to care about and no one cares about - despite the efforts of a talented team. <br /> <br /> Pacheco delivers his usual tour as the leader of Elie Wurman, a former propaganda agent who has been buried in a life of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, dilemma, or destiny. <br /> <br /> The film follows Eli's preparations to take advantage of a liberal political issue, while Ryan O'Neal (good in a subscribed part) divides the latest "dirty laundry" - in this case, a fellow TV actress who has been involved with people The error. Tea Leoni brings her usual star to this supporting role, although the script does not give her much to work with. As Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger is able to raise sympathy despite the mechanics of the improbable plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those who like to watch Pacino simplify their objects, and enjoy other school principals. Unfortunately, between the script and the trend, the "people I know" became quite amateur. Hence his limited theatrical release, and a quick trip to DVD. Consider yourself cautious.
