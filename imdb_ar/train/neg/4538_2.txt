I actually went to watch this movie in the theater, but what a waste of time and money! Bad behavior, I regret to say, did not help to enjoy this viscous scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go to watch this movie, because James Redfield, the author of the book, was deeply involved in the scenario. They really enjoyed the book, so the film was perfect. Well, maybe my hopes were a little high, but I totally hated this film! I was expected, so resolved that I actually left vomiting and worst of all it would be a supplement! Do the world favor and stop this hateful crusade.
