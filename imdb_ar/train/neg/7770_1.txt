The complete mess of the film was directed by Bill Ripan, the man in charge of the really infamous Monster a-Go Go. As I approached the end of the "cold" I came to an incredible conclusion that this film was actually worse than the film "Sixty" shocking. the story ?? as it is ?? It is about three million eccentric people calling a group of people to their remote palace to play a series of horrific games. Anyone who manages to keep pace and survive will win $ 1 million. It's a very simple plot but Rebane is still somehow able to make the procedures about to be incomprehensible. Things that happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. Then it ends. oddly. I mean, what the hell would it all end up exactly? I think you left to draw your own conclusions. The values ​​of production and representation are undoubtedly a standard pornographic film. In fact Pamela Rohleder (Chile) is not so good. It is incredibly horrible that it is convincing. Unfortunately the same can not be said about this farce as a whole, it's just a bargaining chip.
