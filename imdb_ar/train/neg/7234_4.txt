In one word: excuses. I was advised to read some articles about the philosophical meanings of this film later, but after sitting in 115 minutes of the film, slowly crushed under its bloated symbolism and repression flowing through the lava, it seemed better to just report my reactions to the film. After all, who goes to see a movie with the curriculum at hand? This flick was dismal. The main actor Claude Lido, from the opening to the end of the film, is wearing the same mask of pain that is so disturbing and disturbing that it can not be practically distinguished by the melancholy eternal expression of the film. Perhaps each other's portrayal is better than subjugating each other, saying the same thing: the Ambrocourt priest is a miserable man. The story, about a persecuted priest trying to help a rich and troubled family, does nothing to make her characters interesting or sympathetic remotely, because the family is a collection of strange dirt, and the priest himself comes as a curiosity. The last thirty minutes indicate that there are some amazing messages about grace and the suffering of one man equal to the suffering of others, but because of all the lenient confidants of the suffering Lido and the mysterious subtext of Robert Bresson's text, all I finally felt was, let's have some ice cream. Is interesting for Bresson fanatics Paul Schrader, just to see how many personal elements Schrader has prepared in his texts and films, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
