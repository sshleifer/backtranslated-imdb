This absolute litter is closely based on Friday's 13th series which is a carbon copy in practice, accepted as being an Australian film with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, a small boy was accidentally burned while filming a music video at Lake Eldon. Now, several years later, the boy grew up and avenged anyone coming to the lake to shoot a music video. It is trite and funny for time and money, and you see it only out of curiosity, or if you are an ambitious actor trying to learn how to not (not be able) to act. Lead role Alan Dell used to star in soap operas, but ended up in the X files - how did that happen?
