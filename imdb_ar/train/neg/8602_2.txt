All you need to know about this film comes after the opening scene, where a man falls into a lake and eats. Then they start to turn credits Title: You see "mollusks"! In large letters, followed shortly thereafter by the "film". Whew! I was worried that I accidentally caught "mollusks: musical" or "mollusks: game show". Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a festival to kill. You see a man cutting his hand because he had mollusks in his gardening glove, two people are attacked from mollusks during sex, and a girl falls on her back in an underground passage to death because of deadly molluscs. It's a very silly movie, it's in a "very bad" category. He was also filmed very badly with a film so grainy that I was shocked to learn that it was produced in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am very surprised because they got a high degree as I got here, because most people here do not give these types of movies any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being funny, this is one of the main candidates.
