This was the third effort of director von Stroheim - it is very difficult and does not show any of the extraordinary taste of the camera and mastering the editing that will be presented after a few years with his main works, GREED and the wedding process. Basically we have three beavers, disguised as a Russian idol and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money on gambling tables and earn a fortune. Part of this plan is that the Count (von Struheim) hints at the US ambassador and his "foolish" wife, and exploits them in the hope of earning some money by playing on their weaknesses. He errs in taking the savings of the maid he promised to marry. When you see them together, you set the room on fire (von Stroheim and Fristah are on the balcony of the room). Here von Strohim first establishes his character as "the man you love to hate". It is very bad and ultimately leads to the end of his character. The film is strange in the cinema and editing and is worth watching unless you are fascinated by the director. There are some nice things - when he first tries to meet the ambassador's wife, you read a book - we see the title - intimate wives by Eric von Stroheim. The film was originally filmed as a 210-minute film, reduced to 140 minutes and finally released in 70 minutes. Kino Video restores the remaining snapshots (somehow damaged in most scenes) from the previous alternate version to give us a 107-minute printout.
