This film was the worst film ever produced on the planet, and I love Barney more than this film. Suck the graphics, half the moving film, suck the deaths, and above all, you're ready to sue the people who made this movie! Please do not spend hours of your life watching this movie. The only good part was when the movie ended! This film is 50 percent Jurassic Park, 0.1 percent Sabretooth, 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie and you will regret it. Do you want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cover was covered, the graphics were drawn, the blood (I mean is) ketchup, people tried to blow themselves up, and college students thought there was all that and could stand in front of the animal. I mean, there was a 5 meter tiger running directly to a woman, aiming a 100-foot shaft! Wait until you can actually hit! The acting was terrible too. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and that just had to go and destroy it.
