This is not a nastie video, but only because it appeared in 1994 when they were supposed to be tired of everything in Britain. It is a 75% Boogeyman rewording, and has been banned for the same reason - no matter what. <br /> <br /> I was perplexed because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different to Lacey, but she was a person who had a problem because of the psychic visions of the dancing man similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After watching a murder in the bathroom, and seeing the title too, Annie, her psychiatrist and psychologist-like man largely in cheap romance novels and butter commercials, went home, certainly the bathroom itself. After 24 hours a murder occurs as described. Of course, we have no idea who this stupid woman is or why she was assassinated. <br /> <br /> The film then resurrects the Boogeyman story with some additional shots that we have never seen before. It is worth mentioning that boogeyman shows unlike the original. Unfortunately, some good scenes have been cut, but 90% of them are present. Why restart this movie? Have they found clips in the trash? What is the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and although the psychologist told Annie that she had healed, we all know Spider-Man will never die.
