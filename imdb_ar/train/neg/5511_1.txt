I have to agree with the first comment: This movie is heavily sucked. Despite the possession of the list of B large, this film cover (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central during the day of the week, which may be the only exposure, which will get this film) is trying to blame Dangerfield but in reality is just a salary for each representative Comedy of the 1980s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Bigley Jr.? Check. Sound of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive did not have the only terrible flick: check again. And many more. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this is that it Alinvd wrote lazily with the jokes have already been telling them. Nothing about this film outside its funny existence. You're better off watching dry paint. This certainly is things have been leveled directly to the video, which still believes in the old image of the video: Take a old star on the cover and you'll get some money from the lease. As video rental days change, consider one of the latest examples of garbage dumps. <br /> <br /> The only use of this movie is if you have trouble sleeping. You will get there.
