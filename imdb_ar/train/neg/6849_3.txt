The movie "Horror J" is like a young woman returning to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell the family home and meet old friends. I found that one, daughter of the village priestess, had sunk several years ago. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) learned that Saori's mother was trying to revive her life with black magic. Already the links between the dead and the living are becoming weak and friends and villagers see the ghosts. There was nothing exceptional or very good about this film. Unlike the spectacular J-star horror movies, the thrill does not really make the result, and the result does not seem overly threatening and the limits are over tampering. <br /> <br /> This movie is like ordinary white rice cooked very little long ago so close to the marsh. Sometimes you get this in poor Asian restaurants or cook your white rice for a very long time. You end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it spoils the meal almost because of glue, tasteless. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/lcoformovies
