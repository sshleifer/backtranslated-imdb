I recently saw this in Palm Springs International 2009. This is the first feature film directed by veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Veen, and based on my observation, the latter should be. I hate movies that are so unbelievable that you disassemble almost every scene. This movie instantly lets you scratch your head. As a young cameraman and his girlfriend, who works for an international aid organization, begin walking slowly through Taliban-held mountains in Afghanistan, chatting about their love when a truck stops a truck in front of him. Get out of their car to watch as the Tiliban fighters, equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades, execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Valdemar Torinstra) begins to take pictures of all this when a rebel who has a grenade discovers them kills his girlfriend. Since there is a throw distance to the hands, it can not be more than 50 yards away, but it goes one way or the other. His girlfriend was blown up and took a picture of the impact of the bomb she was killing and winning the picture as a public portrait. Every scene and position in this film is as ridiculous as the opening. The following year, Bob found himself on a mission with National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and introduced himself to her innovative world of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I'll give it 4.0 out of 10.
