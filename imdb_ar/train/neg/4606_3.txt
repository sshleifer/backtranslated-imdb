This film was an attempt to go to places most of them did not want, and perhaps they should not enter it. It has been a similar experience from a strange perspective for us in the "cell", although it is not as close as if it was in-depth and well illustrated. The plot is simply constructed with initial initial sense of it. Then, as the film takes on its supposed "drama" role, the plot breaks away from the few legs that it had to stand in the first place. <br /> <br /> The idea is basically the idea of ​​a child (Chris McKenna) needs money. Takes over the role of the successful man, and kills the city accountant. He is not paid for his work, but instead is tortured for days because he dreams of a "wonderful" idea of ​​trying to use his backup file as a means of payment. This stupid step in trying to force them to pay is counterproductive because it is being brutally and endlessly attacked. It starts with madness (some very disturbing scenes). Afterward, he thought he had paid for his sins and could start again, visiting the wife (Carrie and Harr) of the man who was killed and won her feelings. Shortly after his identity is discovered, the tragedy hits the air as the boy follows his torturers (Daniel Baldwin, George Windt, Vernon Wells) because of their former "kindness". You must ask, what is with Carrie and Harrer and horror films / Gore? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything I have put in recently has been in this genre. Granted, I loved it at Freaks Freaks and it was fine in Anaconda. But despite its attractiveness and obvious attractiveness (wow, it's hot!), It can act better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and that's just a misconception. For all the young players there, you will see "Entirely Monty" in this film, although it is somewhat strange and short-lived. I felt like I did some mature porn after watching this movie (something not weird about Carrie's career). Simulating sex makes you wonder what actually happens during filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll say there's some good representation. Do not expect too much from Daniel Palawin, whose career seems destined forever to support his brother Alex. The film was made by some of the old greats, George Windt (Norm of Cheers) and Vernon Wells (commandos, weird science). Above all, Chris McKenna has the best job in the main character, Sean Crowley. His small experience of acting and his reasonable nature as naïve youth bring some essential elements to the film. <br /> <br /> I will not get out of this way. If you feel bored and tired from the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker", I would recommend you watch this. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start acting in some of the best movies!
