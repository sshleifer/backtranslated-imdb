This movie is very bad. The car is running at 30 mph when it is supposed to be going at a speed of 100 ... The shift arm that has been suspended (in Park!), The nurse who works for almost two hours with a cell phone on the shoulder ... No of the moron can take this phone a curse? There is nothing reliable in this crap. I will be ashamed of seeing me in such a film!
