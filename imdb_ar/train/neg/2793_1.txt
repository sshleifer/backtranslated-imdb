This comes first on the list of the best movies I have seen so far in Starz on Demand. They seem to pick up all the festivities directly to DVDs and can find them and put them here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Obviously anyone who has a digital camera and a low budget can come up with a horror movie and put it on TV. To be honest, it seemed terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. Some of the best films I have ever seen have been films that have reduced their budget or in other cases only require a low budget to be fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is not one of these movies. <br /> <br /> You know the chart now, and I'm sure, if you read this. Either I heard about it in Starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page of boredom. It's about a pathetic and fun girl we recognize for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad music video. Anyone who put it together should think it looks really interesting, but it does not look like that really. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she has someone. Then the killing begins. It's really memorable, quite mediocre and as boring as possible. When the first bullet goes off in her apartment, it looks very dangerous like a piece of popcorn popping up. Was this the best sound effect they could get out of? I can find a better audio effect to use for free (without copyright) online ... right. right Now. <br /> <br /> Do not let other reviews claim that this 10-star movie fools you. Obviously they are either distributors of the film or perhaps the director who is trying to convince you to think that this unwanted piece is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Funny.
