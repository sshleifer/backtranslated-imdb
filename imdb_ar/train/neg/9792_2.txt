It must be said first that I read manga and then Hakimi is based on differences. <br /> <br /> This anime frustrated me a lot because it removed comedy and the high quality movement of manga and ova. What I left behind was just a crust of what it could be. Many characters lack the depth of the manga. Alucard is not a sympathetic personal who wishes to die secretly. Walter's story lacks treason. The evil Nazis who plan to plunge the world into war are completely absent. Instead, it provides an evil anime Gary Stu Incognito who is defeated against what seems to be all possibilities. <br /> <br /> My basic complaint is not that the anime deviates from the manga, but it does a very bad job.
