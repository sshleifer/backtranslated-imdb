This movie was in a scientific package 50 pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first film Gozilla, and like this film, he has scenes with American actors who were entered for no real reason. One interesting thing about the scenes included is that there is tension in the cold war portrayed between America and Russia. As in Gdzilla, Gamera woke up from an atomic explosion and raging all over the world, paying close attention to Tokyo because the Big Monster movie was not completed unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, this is a good film. Some scenes involving Gamera, especially the scenes in Toly, are extremely spectacular and have special effects that were beautiful at the time. If you like Japanese monster movies, you'll get a kick from this movie. I give it 4 out of 10. If this was the unedited Japanese version you saw, you probably got 5.
