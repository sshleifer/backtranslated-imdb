Have you seen a movie that lost the plot? Well, I did not really have this one to start with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painful scenes of our hero sitting around the house without any sense of threat or even the vowel that was created even during the constant thunderstorms (never heard of the magnificent double glass in the house)? It seems that the house that is located only a few miles from the town a few hours walk (?) Or the third girl that serves no purpose of the plot only offers an incredibly fast murder as boredom becomes intolerable? Or even the beginning that refer to a series of 20 murders throughout the region although it is clear that the killer never ventures away from home? Or exotic rites with salt and pepper that largely sums up most of the films lack an inherent trend. <br /> <br /> Add a leading actress who can not act but at least wish to do some totally unrelated work Nude scenes for the shower This video is really bad, but not the way you hoped. <br /> <br /> Look at the following just because it was banned in the UK in the 1980s (mostly because of an amazing final because of the lengthy murder) that it offers nothing but the value of curiosity - and classic "booby-trapped" murder (do not worry, it was mailed before At least 10 minutes). <br /> <br /> After walking through the forest, our victims come to some extent the upward slope which is obviously struggling. In the middle of the road they see a figure in the top dressed in black and waving a large machete. What do they do? Slip and run like the rest of us? No, of course not - they struggle to the top and stand comfortably and comfortably in front of the killing weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie as they say ..
