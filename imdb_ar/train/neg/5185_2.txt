A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The text and the dialogues were not written badly, the direction is weak and the boundaries affecting the hammer. This film was clearly aimed at rallying Rang De Basanti but it is not up to the mark because it does not even contain one of the elements that made RDB communicate with its famous text, great acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached. <br /> <br /> Compared to this nearby masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes like as the hero leaks on the evil Persian rug and the hero's teacher stares at the truck in no less! This may all have been acceptable in the 1980s when there was a decline in the quality of films, and bad films such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante have made great successes, but filmmaking has become more sophisticated and more recent. <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every film he makes, but maybe he does not know how to do it! He resorts to the sermon without care about the intelligence of the public to understand what he is trying to say. Maybe he should only focus on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the presentation you will be thinking that Rang de Basanti was much better, and Mr. Santoshi should have left the exploration industry to Shanti Om's mother. Industry bashing? That's right! Santoshi has photographed the industry as a place to bite the back, the dog, and a casting couch in which the hero happily indulges with a star called Sanya. There are some people who think that these parts show the true face of the industry. Incredible everything you see! <br /> <br /> In general, raise your voice against such films and not spend your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * Away from home ****.
