The makers of this film have created a future in which abortion and birth control are not only illegal in every state, but women are also tried for murder and sent to prison for a long time. The political agenda is very heavy here and the style of the film is so low that it loses its power very quickly. No matter which side of the fence it occupies, I recommend skipping it.
