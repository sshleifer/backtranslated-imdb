I saw the cabin on the lake this afternoon in the USA. Considering this movie was made for TV it was interesting to watch the sequel. So, I tune in to broadcast this evening and was very disappointed. I knew I did not like the movie, but I did not expect to be confused by the use of DV (digital video). The film would have been acceptable if these compact digital shots did not seem to come from anywhere else. I expected the Earth Line to be linked to these shots, but there seems to be no logical explanation. (Warning: Maybe the next is spoiled !!!!) The open end in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open end on the sequel is ridiculous. I can not predict going back to the cabin that can be seen unless the movie is shown for nothing, but the commercials are at 4 am.
