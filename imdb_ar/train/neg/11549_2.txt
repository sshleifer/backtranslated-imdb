Although there were some interesting moments, I thought the film was lame. The longer the duration, the worse. As soon as I entered work at Monument Valley, I found myself seeing the wonderful protrusions rather than the increasingly absurd and increasingly unprovoked interaction of characters. First she is in the bargain, then she discovers the truth and releases it on bail. Then she came back again, then the deserts again. Then she came back again. There is no clear motive for any of its decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many lost possibilities. I would say that the pictures were much less than the sum of their parts. People who liked Repo Man seemed to like their admiration. Searchers 2.0 does not match The Searchers.
