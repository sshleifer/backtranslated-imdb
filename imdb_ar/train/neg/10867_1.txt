This film makes you say two things ... 1) I can do better than this (acting, writing and directing) 2) This is very bad and I have to leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It looks like it Shot with my video. I also think that my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. I've noticed that there are some positive posts to this home video; they should be left by the crew or people who have a relationship with this movie. One of the worst 3 films I have ever seen. Hope the book and director leave work. Not even talented enough to do commercials !!!!!
