I had a lot of expectations from this film and more because it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he received an invitation from Boga Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, in English. The two fall in love and decide to flee, but Puja told Jamie that she could not do so because she was the city of Ladan Singh, also known as Bhaiji. But they decided and stole the money from him and only later Jimmy discovered that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh was without. In the meantime, Bhayagi is hired by a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track Jimmy and Puja. <br /> <br /> Featuring Saif Ali Khan, Karina Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, the film is directed by the first-time director Vayi Krishna Acharya was produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yes really! The scene is good, and Kareena Kapoor (and much-advertised weight loss) looks good. But the plot is very high in the story and sometimes meaningless from one scene to another - that's why I said at the beginning that I was expecting more of this film because it was Yashraj's production. With reference to the songs, unfortunately, there is not one song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are moments when one can laugh, thanks Akshay Kumar and Saif could have done better certainly while Karina played Kapoor her role well. But this can not be said of Anil Kapoor - he did not fit him at all as a villain. Finally, Aditya Chopra, who has produced and directed good films like "Lovers" in the past, does not care. What was Yash Chopra doing with this trash film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A bad movie, not worth wasting your time and this is my first last impression.
