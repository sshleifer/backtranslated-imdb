I have heard about this novel for a long time, and many of my friends have recommended that I read it. I searched for him everywhere and finally found him. This is a book that every human being must read, because he is a genius and because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the film and could not wait to see it. When I finally finished, I was very disappointed. Many of the things in the book are not in the film (I do not think this is the spoiler) which makes the film illogical ... Michael Radford may be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as an adoptive book. The film is not dark at all, writing really bad, the only good thing, so wonderful, is acting. John Hurt is a wonderful actor and the only face I can see for myself is Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What angered me most are the people at IMDb who called this "the best adaptation ever" without even reading the book! Or learn anything about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book, do not look at this as an alternative. As a book lover, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points you gave to this movie are about acting.
