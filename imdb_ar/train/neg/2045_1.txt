This movie must be the worst movie I have ever seen. My sister and her friend went to hire the Zodiac (2007) and got this by chance. I think it was a joke before the actual film. It was terrible that I was waiting for him so I was afraid and never did. This film has no actual facts about the real zodiac killer. It is clear that the filmmakers did not commit themselves to searching for anything about the killings ... They only liked the name ... so they decided to write a screenplay about anything true in his name. I was upset I did not realize it was not the film sooner. I try to love something from every movie, I do not hate movies ... at all ... except for this film. If it is possible not to give it any stars, I will definitely get it. 1 out of 10.
