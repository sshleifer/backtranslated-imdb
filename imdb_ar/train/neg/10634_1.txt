Writer / director Bart Seabril is working here on a box of films he says were accidentally sent to him by NASA. He says he showed the astronauts taking television footage of their trip to the moon using camera tricks. Astronauts were in low-Earth orbit all the time, and the editors on Earth created these initial shots in just a few seconds of the final film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's search is so steep that he does not realize that "behind the scenes" footage is really captured in much of the 30-minute live television (also on the pulley) seen by millions, not Hidden in the basement of NASA as it suggests. We have to wonder why Cyril puts his conspiracy on the voice of astronauts in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly shows that the astronauts were testing only the camera, not the fake images. <br /> Finally, anyone can watch raw video footage for themselves without having to buy a copy of Sibrel that has been hacked from them. (You see more than Zapruder's film about John Kennedy's assassination than "The Smoking Gun.") Sibble thinks he is the only person who has seen him. What is most significant is the footage of those raw footage that Sibl chose not to use, such as those that clearly show that the remote land is appropriately broken through window frames, etc., destroying his claim that transparent and transparent materials were placed in the spacecraft's windows to create The illusion of distant land. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on the hint, lack of experience, misleading commentary, and selective citation to treat the viewer in accepting the conclusion for which he is not shedding the actual evidence.
