What remains to say? <br /> <br /> I've read all reviews here and most of them are right. . However, one person has gone so far as to label this villain film and this devil is contaminated (or something like that). ?! Evil Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN mainly made this movie. Open your eyes please. <br /> <br /> In any case, this was the lowest level of bullobanda nonsense that emerged years ago. <br /> <br /> The most horrifying thing about Omega Code is how much money they spend to make it. If this movie is possible, there is no limit, therefore, we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest Loses the Omega Codes." <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in the Bible stories, the new movie will move "Creed" where the Omega symbol never begins.
