The apparent attack on Microsoft by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or market economics in general. <br /> <br /> lobian Liber tim robbins plays a clear and painful caricature of Bill Gates, a wicked caricature who commits the murders of right and left. <br /> <br /> While Microsoft may engage in some anti-competitive activities at times, it is unlikely to actually kill people. So, the film ended up top and silly from the start. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the "deeper" point is that major technical innovations must be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations will never be developed if not for market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> It is one thing that must be opposed to anti-competitive behavior - this is common sense. It is very natural to oppose competition in the market in the first place, which is what the film's slogan ("knowledge of humanity") represents. <br /> <br /> Another example is that Hollywood is far from reality.
