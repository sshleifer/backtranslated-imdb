I feel kind of a genius. I feel like the only person I've seen through this fake film. I've seen it three times, once with the comment, and I found myself annoyed by all the confidants, at all times when the screen appears black, and worst of all, I feel that the film never resolves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he did not appear at peace with the city that gave him much grief or with himself. That was an idiot. If it was not about Peter Cowie's commentary, which explained not only the film but the book it came from, I could not do it at all. I enjoy French movies, but this was a totally ridiculous film. <br /> <br /> The country priest's diaries have been filmed in beautiful black and white photographs, but this alone can not save this fatal, deadly picture. The scene after the clips are very close shots where the characters do not say anything until the camera breaks off and moves to black color does not constitute an interesting or related story. How classic this film has become is a bit puzzling: it reminds me more of the new emperor's clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Ladeau's performance is heart-warming and reflective, if you are a sadist, but this film left me feeling empty because it generally has a poor impression of the Catholic priesthood, a corrupt institution and an adventure of corruption. The victory of the young priest over the pride of the Countess is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will drag you down with his gloomy reflection and his window in the thoughts of the young priest's grief. This priest is no coincidence as modest as he is deplorable. <br /> <br /> Since I do not speak or understand French, I look forward to doing SUBTITLE in English to help understand the film. Well, it's sometimes impossible to view / read SUBTITLE in English and text so quickly that I could not read (and I'm not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. Try everything "chosen" from the Criterion group, yet I can not see why in many ways this gesture deserves. However, I sat in this two-hour film full and felt a little sympathy for the main character, never achieved. He looked more like a victim than a fighter. That is why I say it is difficult.
