This may be the worst attempt in the movie Zombie, and I have suffered from bad luck. Horrible, terrible, terrible. It is clear that any review on this site is the work of the director or the family of directors or director friend. How does this film suck? Let's figure out the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Inconsistent. dialogue? Horrible. I will not close the effects / Gore, as I understand that this budget is low. But was there one coma that was not obese? Come on! For a Rhode Island film, why did that truck leave the Massachusetts painting? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dances while the soldier "stands in attention". Please, do not put your ex girlfriend or your girlfriend's sister in the nude movie. It was an ugly film full of ugly people, and he had no work to mention Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, do not do it.
