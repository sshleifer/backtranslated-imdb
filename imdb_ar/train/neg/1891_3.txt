A documentary about the mare as they cross the treacherous mountains to get their herds of weeds. Watching this silent black-and-white feature, partially marred by an Oriental musical result, a blink of an eye that can not be used in the original exhibition, seems more boring than it seems. The amazing scene is lost on a small black-and-white screen, and there is a complete failure to create any kind of landline. I loved Nanook from the North and Mar the Penguins, but despised this film, despite the similarity of the subject. Physical hardships alone are not only interesting.
