When I first appeared on my happy birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was amazed at the length. Animation and horror films share a common ground: the audience's specific interest, which must be in or about 90 minutes. Anything more, you will lose the bulk of your audience. <br /> <br /> These were 110 minutes or 20 minutes after the show was a big problem for me. I would say that half of this film could have been edited, but I would be very generous to say so. Watch it and tell me the number of scenes that could have been edited, even without being one of the most important films. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the visit that exceeded the length of stay, the film was below average. He spent all his time trying to make up this huge puzzle in which Elite 10 kills the remaining friends. For the most part, they do not just exaggerate, they add to the face and say, "This man is no! You'll spend more time with the camera that misleads you than actually enjoying the movie. It does not make me start acting. <br /> <br /> Well, it made me start. I had to laugh at first trying to remember whether Melissa Su Anderson had played the character who blinded Little House in the Prairie (research later proved to be correct) because throughout this film she seemed really blind. Strange, as a well-established actress, she should have been better than the group, but turned out to be the worst. The rest of the staff, unlike Ann (Bregman) was so bad, but she, ah, took the cake. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a group of ten friends, and one of them is instantly killed off. Hardly anyone thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue on their way. Slowly, then more quickly, there is something that reveals Virginia (Anderson), the main character and past and doctor herself, who is a little more personal (and on a 24/7 day, apparently) than shrinking. All the time, more and more deaths are occurring. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, just like the disappearance of the first "disappearance", as the "best shoots" disappears, the less attention is paid to care. Sure, they give a few seconds of broadcast time to say, "Wow, this person will not run away," but then go back to their sexual ways. Speaking of it, maybe because of the terrible scenario, or maybe I was the one who was losing interest in the 30th minute, but it was really hard to keep up with the loved ones from the group because they were all sexual partners in either being the next person or someone might be scared to MAX by another friend and best friends in the next scene. See: The scary man who kept a mouse / mouse in his pocket ?? Literally ?? The suspect was the most obvious. I gave the film a lot of credit (and time), but how did it become part of the "Elite 10" that I would never know. <br /> <br /> But I go on to say that there is a mystery here. Why are these children targets? Why does Virginia think it killed someone, when it never proved ('to the end') that none of them has been slaughtered? Why does the trailer and the poster claim that these killings are "six of the most exotic murders you may ever see"? Hell, until 1981, most of these films were shown in the first two films on Friday the 13th? Coincidentally enough, Friday was the 13th part 2 2 weeks to the day of my happy birthday. Maybe, they're talking about the time they saw it months ago, but they were late at the party, okay. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you should rewind 3-4x to get ridiculous and inconsistent drives, and until then, place subheadings to get all the words of the deadly victim. Even if you get the first time, it is an incredibly vicious and funniest ending. It is almost worth watching the entire movie again, but as a drink game. <br /> <br /> This Christmas gathering should be avoided. It's a first-worst scenario scenario? Please note that multiple rewritings are required prior to the role of the cameras. It contains either of the two methods under representation or over-representation and is 100% unrealistic about how people interact in exceptional circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side note: When you are a child, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. We got our first video, and you recorded the greatest number of horror movies outside the TV network (or, EDITED VERSIONS) TV. All I remember from my happy birthday is getting the last ten minutes on the bar, which scared me to death? Obviously I gave away great mystery about who was the killer. Although I have watched other clips of this film, I think this is the first full show to watch. Fortunately, this terrible film did not hurt me as a child. I am older now, I can take this garbage. But it will not happen again. <br /> <br /> Side note 2: However, the crazy "Happy Birthday to Me" song that was played at the end of the credits (and as a result all the time) is still creeping heavily. I think this film (or last minute) has an impact on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Su Anderson!
