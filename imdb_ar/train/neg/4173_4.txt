A man must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking on a bad vampire ass led by the veterinarian Michael Ironside .... in space. I mean, I was not expecting a high art, but it looked like a possible classic film from B films. This was undoubtedly a television pilot, who was later converted into a feature film, after he was not picked up. Well, I'll start with the movies with a few good points, and the procedure was appropriate for a low budget movie, and CGI and the sites used were acceptable. Now on the bad guys, Michael Ironside was the first barley in this place, and his performance here .... well, it was not good. But as I said he did not exist anyway, so I can not blame him. One of the things that was really stupid, the PETA group was Vampires, no I'm not joking, it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a long time and it's taken seriously. This film also commits one of the most serious sins of film "B", it evokes a spectacle, and does not offer. Most of all what drowns this film is nothing really happens. Because it was supposed to be a trial program, the script is almost nonexistent and does not have a regular end. So the main villains, only come in the end. If a movie is ever needed to increase the factor of corruption and injustice, it is a vampire wars. In conclusion, I will say that the main crew on the spaceship were all actors with great abilities and could put this mess behind them well, and progress with bigger and better things. They had nothing to work with here.
