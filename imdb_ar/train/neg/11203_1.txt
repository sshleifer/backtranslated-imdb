The screenwriter has tried badly to recreate the "evil spirits repellent", but to put some love stories blah blah that makes you sick rather than keeping you busy. There is absolutely no content in this entire film. But I hit him by showing a bunch of people hate the things that nobody cares about, so boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this but the stupid movie tickets were so expensive I had to endure the miserable torture that felt like it went on forever Nothing on the screen is linked to back To all that the characters are talking about. <br /> <br /> Using computer graphics in this place instead of my admiration (as intended, I hate CGI) just ruined the movie more. Some people say that this film was terrible in cinemas because of "thought provoking" and "slow motionless - because it is a smart film." It was smart or thought-provoking when the story basically raises a beautiful boy like a Ledger priest who has a love interest and is in violation of his religion. It sounds like an uninspiring concept. Oh, and there are some jumbo mumbo for "The Most Euthanasia" (the film was originally going to be titled "Eater Eater"). A lame concept, but the film took the "sin of the eater" seriously, making the film become pathetic about his power and intelligence. Yes, I know that there were really sinners in the Middle Ages, but this film makes it look cowardly. <br /> <br /> Nothing has been done in the movie correctly and I forget why I'm so upset to see this movie. If you want horror movies that already have depth, see Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or any of the Romero "Dead Trilogy" movies. The nonsense dialogue is not equated with intelligent people, and mainstream film lovers believe that although (the same kind of people who think that funny film like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want a boring horror of mind, watch it. This film makes the church look like a roller coaster ride.
