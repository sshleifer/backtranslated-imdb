Any time the film is short-sighted in its desire to present a particular point of view or point of view so as not to disturb a real story simply, it is annoying. These are the types of films in which the end or point of view is conceived first, and the story is simply put forward. That is why we often talk about the story of "jumping through the hoops" as they evolve, trying in vain to advance to the previous end in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The story at Comet Over Broadway is just jumping through the hoops, it's a three-ring circus. It's ridiculous, ill-conceived, and deceptive to the point that if you're likely to speak loudly on the screen, it will continue to jam before it ends. <br /> <br /> A sink is a woman's choice between family and profession. Since it is all terribly chaotic, it will end up attacking either side. Therefore, in the end there is no meaning to the story, the subject becomes irrelevant, and as is often the case with weak displays, the representation does not save anything.
