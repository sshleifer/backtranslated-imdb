Geez! This is one of those movies that you think you've reviewed before but you did not. I mean you did not give up, but it was in your mind one way or the other. <br /> <br /> Be honest and brief; this is one of the worst, dull, stupid sparks ever. I can not say anything good about this piece of nonsense because there is a barely fitable sequence that can tell them that professional filmmakers. The plot is fairly good keeping in mind that they copied "popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, this is not a bad film so good it is. It's very bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried her best but was not enough.
