Georgia Rule should be one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. The whole film has a very surreal feeling that made me moments, "What?" Loud at least 7-10 times during her two-hour arduous journey. <br /> <br /> In a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as trustee, Felicity Hoffman her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as the biggest and sexiest and sexiest girl in the world, the viewer thinks this would be " Clichy, "lightly, flick about growth and reunion with the family. <br /> <br /> He talked about the wrong advertising at worst. <br /> <br /> After many animal clips that are doing "funny" things in the background of "pivotal" scenes, not to mention five full minutes, they focus on an old woman entering the doctor's office every week to change her diaper, or the fact that this is about Lindsey Lohan, who is sexually assaulted by her father-in-law, Georgia Rule creates a special kind of cinema: the unfounded comedy of acting and the awful dealing with very serious issues in the most critical, surreal, strange way. If Gary Marshall wanted this film to be a drama / comedy, he should watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Side. JUNEBUG. Etc. and so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel that I can get a reader to understand the horrible kind of Georgia's base is to create a hypothetical position. The film, the 40-year-old virgin, is said to be about the main character in celibacy because he was sexually harassed as a child. But instead of taking a dramatic turn, the laughter of the belly and comedy, followed by reactions from all the characters, are false reactions from human beings who demonstrate care. <br /> <br /> Throw in a yellow parrot, Dermot Mulroney as the best non-dimensional characters that could be completely cut off from this badly written text, along with a male character whose religion all beliefs and ethics are to be with a trivial, In any of his own interests, as well as an unnecessary chase scene for cars, and unrealistic moments of characters trying to relate to each other, you've got a Georgia rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film an insult to any of those people who are struggling for filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. They have a lot of talent and do not get noticed. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> If you must, drink enough sugar before hand.
