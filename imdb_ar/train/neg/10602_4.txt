This film is often folly and the only reason this film deserves to be seen is that Jean-Claude Fam-Dam plays a leading role in this film. There are some good motion pictures in this film and its best at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is very bad, the worst representation I have ever seen, and actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jay White can not act at all. This film must be one of his worst films, Claud Vam Dammes, and if you're watching one of his great films, you should watch Blood Blood, KickBoxer, or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> For all this movie is crap / OK rating is 4 out of 10.
