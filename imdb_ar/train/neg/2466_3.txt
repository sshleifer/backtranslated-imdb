There has been a vogue in the past few years for movies often associated with coma, not ridicule, as well as the embodiment of other media to eat dead meat revival. "Fido" is a film that either tries to take advantage of it, simply a manifestation, or both - and falls directly into the category of zombie paradox. The humor here is that we see death walking in the paradoxical context of a typical, large-scale and clean history, (we are following the great zombie war, creatures being created as slaves) a replica of the 1950s suburb. <br /> <br /> It's a rather funny concept of its own, and maybe enough for a five-minute comedy, but it can not disrupt a feature film alone. The joke that rotting bodies of servants do not correspond to this perfect version of a small town is repeated over and over, and loses all effectiveness. The relentless soundtrack plays sunny rhythms while zombies eat passersby. The word "zombie" is inserted consistently into the otherwise familiar colleague's line to try cheaply in laughter. <br /> <br /> The sheer breadth and fabrication of the "50s" representation here can only irritate me. It is very flamboyant, evidently inspired by Pleasantville, which is more evident in the waving of the signs of the 1950s than it bears any actual resemblance to anything that might happen between 1950 and 1959. On this subject, as if That the film boasts of impatience and the idea of ​​how open the millennium and the most superior in the new millennium. <br /> <br /> Since characters represent a wide representation of pop culture types, it is difficult to develop much of their emotional investment. Each of them has some personal traits thrown at him or her - Helen is obsessed with appearances, Bill loves golf and chases him by having to kill his father - but they remain completely two dimensional. Performance within these bad writing limitations is good. The best is Billy Connolly like Fido Zumby, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in the film "Frankenstein" actually confers personal and sympathy with a stray green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are a few parts of the indifferent symbolism that have been put about - fetish goods, racism, classicism, paranoia, etc., but none of them works at a comprehensive level, nor do filmmakers; stick really with Anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not really skimp "Look! Zombies in" Leave it to Beaver! "" For an hour and a half.
