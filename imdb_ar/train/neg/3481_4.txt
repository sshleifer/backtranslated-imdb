May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but anyone who is savvy enough to read this can discover every plot that turns from the start. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie I liked. I did not hate it in the way of some films that smudged your intelligence, but all felt so much predictable on its way to the happy ending required. There were funny parts along the way to make sure, but few of them were original. At least, did not go to the bottom. <br /> <br /> Cristina Applegate looks new, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their sights together are actually the only recovery feature. Everyone else is a cardboard clip, including, amazingly, James Gandolfini, who had to have this in favor of someone.
