I saw this when I was in the theater and started very strong I mean again in 1980 that it was a bold film and had excellent special effects at the time. Now you must be at least 30 years old or so in 1980 to really understand this point because the study of cinema historically lacks the specific mind at the time of expectations and other psychological factors related. Now as I said, the film was very enjoyable and enjoyable. It reaches its excellent climax, and then ... I end up referring to the person who described it as a water balloon in your hand before throwing it, besides being a very poetic description. In my experience, they were not strong enough. My wife and I were fine ... how can I say this? We were upset, I mean we paid money and invested time to see the movie which was excellent. "We felt that we were robbed at the end of our conviction that the production company had to run out of money and could not collect enough to finish it properly." In fact, my wife said it was the best, it was not over, she stopped!
