I saw this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad she was with me remained almost forty years. I did not want to trust my feelings about the film when I saw it, so I consulted a film review published in a major newspaper the next day and confirmed morale, and the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, unencrypted and uninspiring. A little research reveals that the product was the husband of the star Leslie Karon, so the pomp of favoritism refers to the beginning of this terrible film. The film's list of many qualified actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Skatman Brothers, Gloria Graham, James Seking and others - suggests that he holds some hope. But the death of this film is attributed to its terrible scenario. The "mystery" involved is very mysterious and little revealed throughout the film so that the viewer is left perplexed from place to place. The film seems to be torn between being a mystery and a spy, but it never settles on the other. The feeling of suspense is completely absent. Main characters settle on playing dry and passionate types in a way that does not inspire any sympathy at all. The cinema is pedestrian. The result is that the unhappy viewer loses interest in characters, the plot and ultimately the film itself. I am a little surprised that there is no copy of this pathetic movie available for purchase. I hope that if TCM finds a copy of this movie and feels compelled to broadcast it, it was safely transferred to the fourth hole in the morning.
