I can hardly believe I saw this again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Sometime, I watched 6 Fu films in a row ... Boris Karloff, and all 5 Chris is not. Another 2 Les, both of them prompt (I use this word loose) by Jess Franco, were repugnant. At that time, I went over this, remembering that, somehow, it was worse off. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw him. It will never happen again. You know what is worse than this hateful film? Fantastic piece of S ***. This is what FIENDISH plot. It is a very beautiful film. Great production design, collections, fashion, music, photography, editing, cast mostly good, some decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... Absolutely, positively, one of the worst texts in the history of the film! ! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the film is very misleading ... one might make a mistake for a decent film. And then they begin to sing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and went down. After Burt Kwok (whose master says "your face is familiar") accidentally dumped Xer Fu's biography to extinguish a fire, leading to his conviction of torture and burial and cutting off one of his ears, was the closest thing to their funny. It was as if someone had decided to want to make "campy" - it was ridiculous. Ironically, it's ... funny ... it's not. Absolutely. <br /> <br /> It is sad, because it is clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research in the Fu Manchu series in order to get many of them "true". With a different script - either really funny, or dead serious, they may have - can be - should be - a classic on their hands. A film that could have made one forget the horror of those atrocities committed by Jess Franco ... instead of making one want to dig them as wonderful, compared. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 1970s when a whole group of 30 classic characters was revived in films that were horrifying worldwide. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Color Ranger, Charlie Chan, and even Doc Savage. I'm not sure, this may be the worst. It took a lot of self-control so that it did not progress quickly on whole parts of it, especially any scenes containing Sayed Caesar (the FBI chief who was also the cousin of Al Capone - do you see what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the film are not funny ... they mostly do not make any sense at all. Such as when they "test" police officers to impersonate the king and queen, and end up seeing the routine of the dance floor "test" like singing, dancing and riding a single-wheel bike. How many medications should this person take to make any of these things logical? <br /> <br /> As I said, shame ... and a real waste of all that talent, including Peter Sellers (who played both Foo and Neland Smith), Bert Kwock (who was in Chris Lee's film in his time) Helen Mirren (the policewoman who falls in love with the villain and rages near the last half hour steal of the film!). I start to wonder if anyone will ever make a "fit" film from Fu Manchu, or whether fans will have to settle Karloff being the only one?
