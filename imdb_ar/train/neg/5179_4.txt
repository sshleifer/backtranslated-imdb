Without effective indulgence with subtle subtle differences in humanity or poeticism, all this creative team must hope for the effective use of its non-original medium elements. The "Party of Five" became obsessed and thus can not be overcome genetically, and there is little interest in rooting because the single non-lethal element is the second-class Wes Bentley. In fact, each representation is a deep skin. Although dark-haired women are adorable, they are kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacks adequate blood buckets. All sensations are kept at a safe and harmful distance ... an unfortunate fact given the specific name of the managers is "Butcher". Does not provide any obvious tension except the soundtrack, the angry country is unwanted and volatile result tense. Sometimes, some hardcore comic books add attractive low angles that add to the feeling of distress ... But for the film that calls itself horror, I was not even close to flipping once. Perhaps the greatest focus was on community regeneration by taking blood, scenes directed at different geometrical shapes outside the arena, and a constant focus on fun through family slag or traps that people need to sympathize with others in order to escape for a dilemma that would improve my mind, It was a good start to my trip through horror.
