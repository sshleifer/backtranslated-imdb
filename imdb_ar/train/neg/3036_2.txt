This movie was very shocking! I can not understand how this film made production. Nothing against the film crew, of course, this is all a mistake from the writing team. You take the old mediocre plot - let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or step in this situation. But this lacks any real plot - or at least one that would care for anyone. With the Canadian-speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American place - this film is still very stable. On the plus side, the output was very good and cinematography was also fit. It seems that the production budget was also very generous. My only request is to leave this writing team alone and find real script writers to help them broadcast live lyrics in the film. The net result - how moving is how you absorb.
