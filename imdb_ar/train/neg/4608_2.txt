I purchased this DVD because it contains a curry, she said mpaa ratings; "R was rated for strong violence, sex, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> which should be properly articulated by the IMO; "R was classified as strong violence, sex, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexual activity" should come after the word "comma" and not "and" because of the significant difference in meaning it makes. I think many people who have seen this film will agree with me that sexual parts and nudity never exist. My first impression when I look at the mpaa rating is that I will be watching something like a "live" movie. That's why I felt cheated. A wise story, so it is, after all, who really cares about the story if Carrie is wonderful. I know I do not. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is my only opinion. <br /> <br /> Yousef
