Unnecessary to seriously mislead the conduct of troops as a general rule. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African defense force, it serves few ends - certainly not worth entertaining. <br /> <br /> The aspiring filmmakers - this is how not to make a war movie. Do some research, some pride in your product.
