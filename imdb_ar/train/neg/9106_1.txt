From the opening scene, you will notice how difficult it is to try and simulate the "smart intentions" of the smart and very powerful, and the extent of their decline. You will also notice the terrible choice they made by shooting Robin Dunn in Valmont ... Then in the second scene, the best two things in this film are Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Catherine and her mother. That is, if you can bypass the fact that Catherine was not blonde in the first film ... then the film continues, you'll see the cheap romance story of the previous mileage and notice that Sebastien has already met Annette in the past, here called Daniel and Cecil, ... How original is that in Prequel. Then it turns into a low-budget "Wild Things" with lots and lots of "twists." As I mentioned, Robin Dan was a very bad choice. It does not mean he's a bad actor, he's good. He does not have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, progress again. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way to save one of these wastes. As a whole, this "movie" looks like a "Beverly Hills, 90210" episode. The result was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the result from JAWBREAKER ... Can not they leave at least one result?! You'll want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, watch Steven Frears' dangerous relationships.
