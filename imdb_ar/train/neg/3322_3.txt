Unfortunately for me, the first movie Busby Berkeley I ever saw was "Street 42". Then I expected all of his things to be good. I discovered that this was not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite actor in the classical era of James Kenny. <br /> <br /> Oh, the music numbers in the end are amazing as always, but the story is like a lot of others and very cumbersome. They seem to always include the cries of unhappy producers. In this film, Cagney is who ends up yelling so often that he gives me a headache after a while, and his personality wears .... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are anywhere near "Row 42nd Street, songs that can interest you for years and decades - decades, I have to say ... The songs in this movie are memorable.No, this is one of the few early Cagney movies - Berkeley films - I do not like them completely and I was very disappointed while watching.
