No one should ever try to adapt Tom Robbins' book to the screen. While the film is good and the performance is good, the dialogue, which works well in reading it, is nonsense when talking. Or, in other words, it is unlikely that one would suggest that hearing another person's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl. <br /> <br /> In general, the film looks like a highly adaptive slope Notes on the book - most of the parts were broken down to five volumes in the book, in terms of dramatic background and current story, and the end is very different (and unpleasant) in the book. Most of the plots of the book, including plots that make everything logical in the end, have lost most of the logical reference in the book makes the viewer say "huh?" Unfortunately, this effort does not deserve the text that was read, compared to the book, it was burned, and all the actors were sent to do something much better. I am very impressed with Gus van Sant, but even someone of his caliber could have made a film fit for such a complex book without making amulets.
