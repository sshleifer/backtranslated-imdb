Sorry, but every time I watch a movie where a woman shines a man and a man does nothing but creeping, the film loses all credibility. So the new Starbuck (female) immediately spoiled this plot before it was launched from the ground (not intended as pun). Dirk Benedict was more logical than the sensitive hero of the new hero Katy Sakhoff - who is likely to be considered henceforth as "attractive, exciting, watchable, and pioneering" with the right political performance. But in essence, it's just a tired old picture of a woman carrying a slice on her shoulder the size of an independent house: the biggest clich√© on today's screens. Perhaps this series gave one more shot, but the human cartoons alone would not keep me on the alert. As James Hilton once said, "A story, please; just give me a story."
