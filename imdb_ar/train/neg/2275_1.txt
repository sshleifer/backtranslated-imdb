A new version of Alejandro Amenabar Abre los Ojos, but this time with a live breathing mask and lead. For the dubious benefit of an audio track in English, we perform Tom Cruise at no cost, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is determined with his personality, but we are usually given some personal down to hold our interest. His empty attitude negates any exciting energy that can be between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> A representative exercise involves the use of masks to liberate the actor to enrich his presentation of the character by the body language and meaning. Cruz's painful disappearance underscores his inadequacy as an actor. Do you see 1997 Original Amenabar Open your eyes!
