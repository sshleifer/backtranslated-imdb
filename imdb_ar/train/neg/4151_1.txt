Perhaps this is the best horror film made since the death of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> I can not spoil the end, because I never know what happened. I will try my best. There are some kind of vampire lesbians, but they continue to swap objects, so they may or may not be any personal character that they are supposed to think they are, or may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> The confusing sound? This is not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters makes sense at first. There is no plot, no personal development, random people appear, speak a few lines, then disappear, and can never be heard again. There are also zombies, they are * probably * vampire enemies, but there is also a sequence of dream dreams inside a mental hospital, so perhaps none of this actually happened, and the main character's hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The upside? Both leading girls take off their shirts briefly. The special effects are simply mind boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow fighting sequence). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the overall level of joy. <br /> <br /> The rent is worth the price. We laughed until we cried.
