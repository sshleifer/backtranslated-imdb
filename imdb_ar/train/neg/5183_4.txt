This is the first group of "8 Films To Die For" series that I have seen, and it certainly did not make me want to see any of the rest ... although I have heard that at least two of them are fit. I do not know, this was not terrible but it did not do much for me. Your family has basically dysfunctional cannibals in the suburbs sort of thing, my mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring stray food sources home whenever possible. The best part of it is the fearful gothic sister, who naturally invites a friend out of school that never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher shop downstairs and so on. This family is somewhat like the white version of Sawyer Clan, it's bad and does bad things but it's not without spirit. I see a lot of reviews from people who loved this, I think I do not know what I missed, but I found it very average and would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 of 10.
