This is my first movie review on IMDb. I had to register after watching this movie. I can not, in good conscience, allow this film to be reconsidered. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my classification is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weiss and Christopher Walken, however, I hated this movie. There is a conspiracy, but who cares when there is no text. Dialogue is unrealistic and completely boring, the positions are fabricated, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are sympathetic and not interesting, the story, although they are based on a good premise, they are stupid. This film is a piece of feces. <br /> <br /> Do not mind wasting money on this movie, it is not even worth spending your time watching it. Please do not see it ... I beg you!
