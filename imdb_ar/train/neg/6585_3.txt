In reviewing this film, I can only experience my experience as a weekend warrior I do my basic training in July, August and September 1971 in the Garden Park spot, Fort Polk, Louisiana. High Ground was not like anything I remember basic training. <br /> <br /> But one has to remember at that time that Korea was in a dead end, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. Vietnam, the guerrilla war, was not where we continued to flow into the endless pit. The draft was not welcome at the time, but was accepted as necessary to defend the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran who has now assigned the government side to train troops to leave abroad. The film revolves around one of his training courses and the squad members he has to train. It's the usual genre you'll find in any war movie of the last decade. <br /> <br /> One of the things I will cite is "The High Ground" is the fact that MGM realized that our army is now an integrated army with William Hazard as a black recruiter in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times that was changing. <br /> <br /> But I will say that a recruiter like Ross Tamblin could have been cured from his smart mouth from the first day. Richard Widmark was not risking death or becoming a foe to give Jerome Cortland confidence in a weapon. There will be no reason to worry about Robert Arthur's escape. Only deputies were allowed to deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, they were filmed in Fort Bliss, El Paso and around Texas, giving Take the High Ground a good reputation. But show it as a film that mobilizes the army and you can certainly understand why the government cooperated eagerly on this day. <br /> <br /> I remember that drill sergeants face small conflicts that you can pick up when you are not worried about getting your case for something 95% of the time. But there is no way that Carl Malden would have led to Widmark out in the open during training in front of many witnesses among recruits. It would have been possible for both of them to realize that he would have undermined power, which the army was not allowed to do. <br /> <br /> I wish I'd said something better about "The Ground" because I definitely love his talented team, he's certainly the talented director Richard Brooks, even the ridiculous idea of ​​Dimitri Tumkin and Ned Washington, a new Oscar about a year ago Hi non. The film won Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and Story by Millard Kaufmann. Kaufman's imagination must be alive.
