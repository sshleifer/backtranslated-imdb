When Carole (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to consider her brother's death, she begins to doubt something more evil than the "natural causes". The closer she gets to the truth, the greater the threat to her husband's sister, Fiona (the Helga line), and the rest of the local demons. They will do whatever is necessary to put an end to their curious ways. <br /> <br /> If you are in a satanic, satirical film, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is full of nudity and soft sex. One scene in particular should be looked at for a young woman and a goat. Unfortunately, not all candles in the world can save black candles. Most of the film is total bear. Unlike the first scene I have already mentioned, the many sex scenes are not appalling and certainly not exciting. Intermittent representation at best. Even the preferred type of Helga Line offers disappointing performance. The plot really does not matter. Her main job seems to be holding a series of boring sex scenes together. I'm just familiar with one other film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his dark daughters who brilliantly blend between excitement and horror, the black candles emerge from the amateurs. 3/10 about the best I can do.
