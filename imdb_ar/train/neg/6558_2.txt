We rented five New Year's Eve movies at the end of the week and saw them first. All I can say is that there is no place to go until after seeing this place. It was useless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's text must be easy to write - just make two words out of every three words of a curse word. Andy McDowell is surprisingly good at the list of characters, but the film has nothing else to recommend.
