This film is simply one of the worst films ever produced, a devastating charge not only for the British film industry but also for futile breakthroughs in today's work. Not only did the film get the mainstream distribution, it also has a wonderful collection of British actors. What's wrong with it? I do not know, and simply do not care enough to participate in the discussion because the film was so terrible and not worth thinking at all. Be careful and stay away from this garbage. But obviously I need to write ten lines of text in this review, so I've drawn the details well. There is no man who is set up by his evil friend and his co-worker from his father's company, and thus leads to confrontation with the Russian mafia and dodgy nicknames and coils / plot devices are very stupid. I should have asked for my money, but maybe it was still in shock from the experience. If you want a good crime film watching the usual suspects or Godfather, how about the lock, the arrows .... This is the height of contemporary British crime film .....
