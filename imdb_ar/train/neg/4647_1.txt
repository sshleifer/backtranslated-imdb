Half of the reviews were good so I took a $ 10 chance. Certainly Priscilla Barnes talked about some discussion about sex, but it was not much. The whole plot later that she may be the other actress's mother and the documentary maker falls down to the young woman sprawling it. It's not funny that not a naughty is not much of anything but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry, and this depended on nothing that never happened in the industry. It could have been shocking to what is common today in the adult movies that make fun of the current Gonzo videos and that the big orgy had five minutes to photograph what was joked the biggest and best orgasm in decades in the early 1970s.
