Why do you show that millions of us saw and loved them as children and made a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood does not earn the money it used to. Because they put down the garbage and paid huge sums to the actors to be garbage men and asked us to pay $ 10 to see their waste. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good boys came at the top. It was not gone with the wind but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with anything original, so they take something good and destroy it in some charms. I only hope that this film makes 10 Ã— less than the cost of making it. The only person who gets any pleasure with this nonsense is the men who got the command of General Lee. The public is the victim. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, see Replay the TV program instead. They are still standing after 20 years.
