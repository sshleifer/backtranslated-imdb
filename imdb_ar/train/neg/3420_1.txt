I saw this film for the first time at about 12 pm on Saturday. It's really the perfect time for this one. I have never seen a movie that was actually more predictable and immersed in stereotypes. If you want to watch a sexy movie, do not watch it because you may lose the desire to live halfway. However, if you want to laugh well, please watch it! I bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD series on Saturday nights. What surprised me most was that the scene that would be too expensive was a copy of a Discovery documentary or an old television show on the US Army. Moreover, I was amazed at the fact that they did not make the slightest effort to make the production seem real. Afghanistan, as far as I can remember, is nowhere near any sea yet with one click Deke flees from the terrorist sand castle with his jet pack and takes it by submarine (perhaps Discovery). Later in the film, the terrorist Dick throws Islam at the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can see the long hair of a Korean imitator floating in the air when you smash it on the wall. You will love it. I advise you to watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer, so you will only understand why I'm angry enough to spend â‚¬ 6.99 on the box.
