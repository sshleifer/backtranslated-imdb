This is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. There is nothing good about this film. The plot is plain stupid, meaningless dialogues, and comic scenes have never heard anything about true humor. The actors do not play, but the worst they do not try. The same text exists somewhat in the same league with Ed Wood and Owie Paul. There is only one good thing in this flick, battles. They are well designed as one would expect from young Hong Kong, the only reason to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I think the battles are supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter does not have to think about the subject of the story. However, this silly little conspiracy may prevent you from seeing it to the end. Avoid it unless you are a fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
