This is one of those films that manufacturers think they reject because they are too bad. Obviously they were thinking that kids were stupid and excellent to accommodate endless ads and they thought they were entertaining because that was very funny. What's with the car talking with buttons saying Wendy, McDonald's, M & M and Skittles? There was no car talking in the animation. (D) The claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. Why Robert Everett's "Claw" Anyway? Was the book on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems they were (badly) mocking Robo Cobb, turning a man into an Android game fighting crime. I tried to restore my money, but there was a policy if I watched more than 30 minutes of a movie, you would not get a response. I'm sorry I saw more than 30 minutes of this pile of nonsense. After being told the policy of no refund, I decided to watch the rest of the ugly garbage called Inspector Gadget.
