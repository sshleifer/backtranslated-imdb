The vandals of both this and the matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I liked the original matrix a lot. It was not a deep film, despite Fishburne's attempts at philosophy, but he was a good paced and pleasant and I have a quiet place to fight Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Originally, Neo was the secret life of the Cube factor rather unhappy Anderson. After a day, corporate drones, night, brave pirates. In the end, he is ultimately forced to choose between these spirits through his actions - whether he becomes outlawed fighting the machine, or whether he returns to the safe world of forgetfulness that he has begun. Interestingly, he discovers that once one avoids illusions. , Life sucks to some extent. He has his daughter beside him and his sleeping companions, but he eats the processed species, dresses in sweating, and lives in a few truly amazing machines. However, the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first film lies in the "What If I Am" questions raised in the viewer's mind. What if _I_ was able to impossible? What if you are "one". It does not even matter what you are one example, with such a wonderful title. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the client Smith has done a wonderful bad man, because he embodies all the fear of the power we carry with us. It could not be stopped as a termination device, and without mercy. <br /> <br /> At the end of the matrix, Niu must return to the matrix to share his good news about freedom. <br /> <br /> This is a failure of the film to continue to follow the original film ideas completely, and it does so because of the lack of this text, such as writing poor script and poor editing so I can not believe they planned for these changes. When the dialog box is in the fifth row of primary, with many long words dropping randomly, I find it hard to believe they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of configuration failures: <br /> <br /> Oracle moves from little to no help, if it is deceptive to a completely complete hindrance without any real reason. <br /> <br /> The main "characters" are presented in the matrix without having to - the webmaster was, for example, a nice idea, but not just an interesting figure. <br /> <br /> Fischborn fails as an "adviser" and gets nothing to replace. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not especially loved, and will not really want to run them into the world. <br /> <br /> Special effects problems: <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are pointless. In the matrix, I felt that Niu may lose, and that it must become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, it is simply a personal view of a poorly planned video game. <br /> <br /> The battle on the highway seemed very fake and not interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scenes did not end. <br /> <br /> The delirium lasted for a very long time - everyone in my class in the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we are against good dancing and good bragging, but because we did not know about the photographers, we do not care. <br /> <br /> Each of the hackers written by Solo Creator must be included in the list. I stumbled and used words that the screenwriter did not understand clearly, and was a waste of time and a quick killer. It was possible that the Creator's speech would have happened in the tenth time, and it is even more dangerous because "Zion is there to give the rebels a place to go to so that they do not destroy the matrix." There are now many people who do not believe; the Matrix is ​​in danger of crash and killing every addicted person "You can choose one person from Zion to form a new Zion, while scanning the memories of the people currently in the matrix. > Instead, we got a long set of squares. If someone argued that he was deep, ask for a copy, and try to break the sentences. Each of which is too long in several paragraphs, and uses words with clearer and shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in short, it's not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I have seen the third phrase, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. Do not keep this turkey. <br /> <br /> Reviewers who feel that the second and third films should have "deep" must see some really deep films. I may have read a book or two books about rhetoric and discussion, perhaps a little philosophy. It is not difficult to understand this film, but it is difficult to recognize it. <br /> <br /> Scott
