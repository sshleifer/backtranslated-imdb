The Gospel was a great disappointment to me. I have received an email from the theater showing that it is a wonderful and inspiring film. It was neither great nor inspiring. The cinematography was beautiful with the entire film. Many of the scenes were a back-up made in a way that sometimes could not determine what it was. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Many people were also brought into the film. The relationship between him and his ex-son is never clear. Also the whole film has more than one way, and after all the sudden BAM, he healed and inspiring people. It seems that the entire film shows that boxing is one of the bad things in his life, making him live his life the way he lives, but when he changes, does not leave boxing, teaches others how to box. I was astonished.
