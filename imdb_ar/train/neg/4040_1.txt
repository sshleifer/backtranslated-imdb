I consider myself a very strange person when it comes to everything, and although the cinematic experience is more suited to the explosions than the high drama, I may be very fond of the movies too. <br /> <br /> Not everything functional films, however, are better than King Kong. It is very likely that Kong gave two stars, doubled the size of this film. <br /> <br /> I think people are very excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in the play. For unremarkable art, the film, which looks like a play, is a "wonderful art". <br /> <br /> However, this film was useless. <br /> <br /> There was no story so I relied on high drama. The only drama in this film is whether the cat will come off the surface or not. So, a deep and purposeful dialogue, then? A great figure representation? barely. <br /> <br /> To be overly fair: some sights were interesting, though: Communist apartments, city views (Petersburg) and Soviet tram are still in service.
