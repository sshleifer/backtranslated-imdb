It was the idea of ​​an African-American female Scrooge in a modern city struggling inspired by inspiration, but nothing else in this film. Here, Ms. Scrooge prepares a miserable bank that benefits from employees and clients in the largely impoverished Black Quarter where she lives. There is no doubt in the goodwill of the persons concerned. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban setting of this movie, and the script fails to make the update work. Also, the constant message of engagement and tenderness is repeated indefinitely, where the audience becomes tired before the film reaches its familiar end. This movie message does not know when to quit. In a starring role, the talented Cicely Tyson performs very poorly, and sometimes the lines are hard to understand. Charles Dickens' novel has been adapted many times, a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it new and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
