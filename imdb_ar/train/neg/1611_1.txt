I think this film is awesome and productive. Benicio Del Toro should not work in film production, but should focus on his acting and that's all. Stephen Soderbergh missed the whole idea of ​​the revolution, the ideals, and more importantly the life of Che Guevara and so on. The camera is awful, like filming someone who has two-day practical experience, music ... do not know ... Is there some music in the movie ???? I would not recommend this piece of sh ... to anyone. It wastes about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever .... I can not figure out how someone could rate this movie more than 3 stars. Disaster .... disaster .... disaster .... disaster do not see please. Save yourself from this misery of "movie"
