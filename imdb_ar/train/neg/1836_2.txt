How can Barry Levinson combine the hot comedy talents between Ben Stiller and Jack Black, Rachel Wise and brilliant, old pro Christopher Whelken and still make such a stinky soulless? <br /> <br /> Stiller & Black are still friends. Invents a spray to make the dog mess disappear and become a clearly consumed millionaire. <br /> <br /> The building is thin but seems to be enough in the right hand to be a starting point for some great single girls between the two stars but all the interested people have overcome every hand, every chance possible. <br /> <br /> Simply, Stiller & Black are still laughing all the time. Weisz looks as sexy as ever but is released criminally, with the exception of Walken as a Barty bar urging Stiller to take revenge. It's a tough march to the end of this farce Tired.
