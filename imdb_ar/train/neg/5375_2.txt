After watching this movie, I almost felt that I had wasted two hours of my life, but I think there are some good things in everything: <br /> <br /> If you live this movie like any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 peaks , But if rated as low budget ind. Movie, may get 3 or 4. This film is supposed to be "complete" without long sections of boredom or waste of time. This film is not. But I think that many independent films revolve around showing the skills of films, and given that, this film contains some highlights. If you want to comment on what managers should take with them to their next project, I think the distorted sound effects were quality. They are also able to build some characters, but that takes me to what they should leave in their next project, because building characters takes time, because it is often irrelevant to the film's outline. The long areas of time spent in the next project should not continue - what is the benefit? I think this film tries to be a bit of everything (character building, suspense and plot), and it ends up being nothing (not too much) <br /> <br /> This film tries so hard and hard, and I think it should It is cut into a short film. I could easily find a one-hour walk or a meaningless dialogue to cut off the film. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of unimportant things happening in this movie. The story must be simpler. I know there is supposed to be some mystery in this film, but the slight surprise of the killer is not a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" is almost ignored during the film, leaving the final "point" as a quick and unsatisfactory summary. <br /> <br /> So I would say that this movie was a nice try, but I cant. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you do not have an interest in learning to produce low-budget movies, there's no need to watch it - you do not see why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have said, I am sure that the top ten given to this film are people who share one way or another in the film. This movie could not receive "10" from any objective point of view remotely.
