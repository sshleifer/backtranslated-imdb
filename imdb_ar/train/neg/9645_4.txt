It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with the surrounding hype surrounding proving that the dodgers at the box office. London's dreams are no exception. Let's have an autopsy ... all about chasing your dreams and how far you'll go to do it. Sounds impressive right? Unfortunately, the film is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an ambitious musician who wants to become great someday. His dream is to play at the Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 90,000 people calling out his name. He was joined by two brothers, Zohebe and Wessem (Aditya Roy and Ranvigai's debut) and a charming Pria (Asen). Together they form "London Dreams". After persuading the president of the record company, they become sensations overnight. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, who does not want to reveal him until he achieves his goal. Arjun then attends his childhood friend Manjit Khosla nicknamed Mano (Salman Khan), a carefree man who has no ambitions in life, to join their group. Mannu is a trained musician and talent. Arjun later became enamored of Mannu's superior skills and his relationship with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to harass Manu. What happens next is the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Looking at the technical aspects, we feel only the shadows of Vipul Amritlal Sha that we liked at Namaste London. Feeling like imagining a scenario simply. To cut, a glorious photographer. The script is written by Suresh Nair though she has his moments. Defined in a predictable manner, you loaded a script for MTPs. The work of the camera was wonderful in capturing the beauty of London. It is the only entertainment part while watching songs. <br /> <br /> There are a few songs that are respected while others have a noisy fare. Ajay was the person who stole the show with his negative personality. Salman is rude and bothers you. Asin is memorable and I do not do it that will make her big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is fine. Brenda as a bitch is what we've seen in countless movies. Ompuri is running with procedures. I do not want to minimize flaws because it will be a daunting task. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me put it simple and straightforward, London Dreams is a soulless movie you can enjoy on a DVD.
