This film makes me think the others who I saw with Combs were just an accident. The plot had more holes than I thought I had seen in a film purporting to be something more than a "B" movie. The acting was so funny that the memories of the past camp victories were not enough to save her. Consider the scenario I must imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I was quite annoyed that I paid Blockbuster prices for this litter. The fact that it was made for television would have helped me avoid these atrocities and frankly something that these poor people should be warned of. Avoid this movie no matter what.
