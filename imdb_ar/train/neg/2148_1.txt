The spoilers are possible, perhaps. I must say that "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst films I've ever made. First of all, the movie was made at the height of the Disney sequel frenzy. Was created at the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which were damaging to the original film classics. (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I will drop it because their original films were never really classic in the first place.) Let me go on and say that I am a staunch supporter of good Disney movies , And I love the original Disney movie "Cinderella", but the sequel of "Cinderella" was a waste of time The Cinderella character was in a completely different sequel from the original girl I grew up watching. Originally, Cinderella was nice and loving, Preceded by the formulation of the present era such as, "I will do this banquet in my way!" You say that Cinderella Capricorn (As I affectionately call it) says, "Ewww!" This is Anti-Cinderella, I try to find the best in the people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the paternity sisters, good, heck, they made everything to be like Lady Tremin, My question to the world: Did people see the original Disney "Cinderella" when making this sequel? Well, it certainly does not look like that: if I remember correctly, it was an anastasia to Cinderella like Drazila and Lady Tremin. I am all for salvation and forgiveness, but there was no reason to redeem Anastasia in this film. In the first, she was an evil anastasia. In the second, are good. One can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this film, among other films, is ashamed of Walt Disney's name. Perhaps after Michael Eisner left, things would begin to shape around the mouse house.
