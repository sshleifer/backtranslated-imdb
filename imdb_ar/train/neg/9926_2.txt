I just saw the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorite favorites ever! The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The plot was non existent and the representation was not good. It was clearly an attempt to capitalize on the success of Blazing Saddles and there were television programs that succeeded in taking the big films, but this show will never work. Given that for many years television will not even play the disturbing sounds when it is broadcast, it is unreasonable to think that they can put on the TV with the word "N" being put forward. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces !!! There have been quite a few representatives / actresses I have known from other programs over the years. I had to type all the names and do some searches. This was fun. I was arguing with my mother if he was Steve Landisberg from Barney Miller or Mach. I won! :)
