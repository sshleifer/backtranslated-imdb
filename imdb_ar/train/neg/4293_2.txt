"Rain Maker" released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Port Lancaster are the main actors. Can not even save this completely on the melodrama acted. First of all, Hepburn is a horrendous violation as a shy bachelor - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. It is so powerful that it can not be trusted because it is just a simple game, and it was very old for the part. Lancaster has finished its business to the extreme, and Ehr Holiman is too slow and comes more like Heathrow Clapte. Bridges and Wendell Corrie seem to be the only reliable ones to rise a little - but they can not do much. The 1950s seem to have been a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress, which is good. It's just a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (I am among them) I have not made many of them. Although the A list and production values ​​are good, it does not work.
