Maybe "Tapeheads," a sporadic, intermittent parody of the music video work, is the perfect comedy short story, and the stars John Cozac and Tim Robbins are involved in the face of the comic chaos involved. They play the role of almost half-hearted security guards in Los Angeles, starting their own company, Video Aces, which produces fun videos for groups, parties and the star of death. It is very bad that filmmakers have to devise a dark side-plot to calm the running time (hooligans who get involved with a quirky politician and his followers who do little except stay away from the film's core force and send music culture in the late '80s). However, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of assets here: calm, but bland, and stylish on the street without being lovers or conspirators. These men are along the same length as the walnut, and have not put each other. They are the real thing in comedy movies. * 1/2 of ****
