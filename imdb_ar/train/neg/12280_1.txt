I saw a play in Denver and I never felt impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. Part of the body. Nothing terrible here. I can say to my doctor, "My left arm was a little hit after tennis" or "I got a vagina after cycling" with one or more social comments. It can be a "monologue tripip" for all the entertainment or radical suspension I've heard. The monologues were boring but presented with drama, the subjects were old, and I was bored and annoyed. I once thought I laughed but it did not seem to be when I was supposed to. Certainly this is not really a blow. Oh, spoilers: there was LESBIAN! - Oh, wait, maybe not, come to it. And inappropriate caresses! And crack Mama! That around covers it.
