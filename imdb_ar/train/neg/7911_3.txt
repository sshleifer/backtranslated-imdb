It was not outstanding enough to be really awful, it was incredibly lame. The story was not too bad, but the execution was awful. <br /> <br /> At first, she moved very quickly for us to get emotionally involved with what was happening. It was a very bad pace. The dialog box was quite unfamiliar, it was flat and boring. <br /> <br /> Their characters, Tapan, have made Deadpool boring. How the hell make a teddyball boring? It was not funny. He was not crazy. I've just had an annoying person with two swords that did not even know how to use them properly. <br /> <br /> The maneuver was tedious. And since when did he have a telekenisis to make the cards float and fly around, or a super force to jump hundreds of feet in the air? And what the heck was with all stupid helicopter moves? I mean, we know they are mutated, but they are still in the physics world. The round Po crew is not a helicopter blade, you can not fly by spinning super-tricky speed. That maneuver will not be able to do anyway. No Deadpool, especially when used as an alternative to the design of real combat dances. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that wire work should only be used by combat coordinators who know WTH they do, and know better than to use it at all. Not connected. shooting. As an alternative to the design of real combat dances. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical fighters in the Marvel comics (Logan, Creed, and Wilson), and some of the worst martial dance design I have seen in the memory of modern film. It was as if the game coordinator had ignored his shoulders and let it all be left to special stimuli. <br /> <br /> After that, I went out of her place, with all these mutants that did nothing. Even the mutants who appeared in his cells enjoyed the powers (it was good to see the Quicksilver gesture), did everything when they came out. Only "Frost" and "Cyclops" did Emma, ​​who really lied about the film. <br /> <br /> Since when was Logan so beautiful? Stupid, "the bullet will take his memory away." Do not you think that Xavier and X-Men have noticed the huge bullet holes in his infected skull when they shot X-rays in X1? I felt sorry for the man Liev Schrieber, I've already brought Sabretooth well considering the scenario. It has made one of the most simple villains in Marvel feel the reality. But he could not save the film from its epic lobe. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was a "reckless" level. Decent story, good actors, very terrible implementation.
