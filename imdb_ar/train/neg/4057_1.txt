This is a very boring film. If I grew up during "Vietnam was", as I did, I have seen and heard all the film footage and arguments here a hundred times so far. But what makes this movie really boring is Carleton Sherwood's narration. The majority of the film is filmed when Sherwood spoke directly to the camera of his opinion at this time of conflict in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you will not find anything new here, there is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another Vietnam documentary. Watching George Butler's "Going Upriver!" Stolen Honor was supposed to be a failed mission in John Kerry, but it failed miserably to achieve that goal.
