British traditional filmmaking is out of control. There is nothing wrong with the portrayal of classical novels, but why should all of them portray them as uneducated? The film rips the courage out of Orwell's hard novel, making it a harmless romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be the best work for Orwell, but no one can forget to forget his wonderful portrayal of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold and heartless city, and Comstock is reconciled by a squadron of bombers. But this film distinguishes anything that may be troublesome in any way, and instead creates a nostalgic journey to the charming London of the 1930s, where everything shines with columns of golden sun, even the slums of Lambeth are gorgeous and full of fresh brush hedgehogs and prostitutes happy. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping the muddy streets are completely misplaced in the world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all is the phenomenal text of the book, the old jokes, the mysterious dialogue. It's very frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the ideal person who plays Gordon Comstock, and the film is full of great actors. But everything is for nothing. This movie has made me very angry! Britain's literary history is proud of its richness, complexity and strength. What do we do? We do not use anyone nice to turn it into a soft garb centered around people who want to feel "getting some culture" while drinking Horlix and falling quietly.
