This film is another good example of what seems to be Jerry Brockheimer, since about 1997, is the best in his presentation of the film a year before his release and not producing a good film. I am not a film critic, but this film was expected as expected. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at an emotional moment, and a pitiful attempt at a love story, was exactly what I expected in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.
