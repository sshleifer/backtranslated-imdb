Characters in less depth rip off. You've seen all the characters in the other movies, I promise you. The text tries to be passive and repulsive but fails miserably. Cast in some hangover meets SuperBad Comedy but the jokes are out of the left field, completely forced, and are almost completely ignored after cracking. The hot chick is old and has no personality, it's just some of the early thirties of a blonde chick with a few ungainly underwear that wears less beloved jokes. Barely the attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (dark love attention) is barely connected. The attraction anywhere can be found in a completely platonic relationship until a critical and predictable seat belt - a kiss accident. This they are in a complete relationship and just incredible lame. The main focus of this film is not the relationship, but the failed attempt to produce a very poor film has a very bad design with a semi-attractive plot. I can compare this with residues, in their coercive nature. I will not go into it. I can go on, but it is useless. Just do not pay to see this movie.
