I thought this movie was terrible. I am Chinese, so I thought that everything was completely wrong. Many facts were incorrect. The only true thing about Chinese history in the film was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the fighting scenes were very cheesy and fake. Not many actors and actresses were wonderful. Some jokes that were supposed to be "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst rating possible. Disney should really get more information about Chinese history if they want to create a movie that is expensive. Mullan was very accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
