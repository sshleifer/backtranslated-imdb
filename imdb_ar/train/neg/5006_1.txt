Nothing is like a movie about a group of friends who hate each other just to the point of hate, but have little or no recollection to make an audience * love or sympathize with any of the characters. There are very bad films that are good (La Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and there is very bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's work). This film is hardly acceptable even if you are a talented MSTie pioneer (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I'm talented in this regard (this is how my mind works all the time), for those who are not naturally gifted in MSTie riffing, in the end to * this movie * you'll just want to pull your head, painfully aware that the movie "Taboo" takes you about an hour and twenty minutes you will never go back. Even the talents of MSTie were hardly matched by this dull waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone * is green-lighted and / or funded by ... Taboo was hired only for the usually talented Amper Benson, who obviously was blackmailed in doing the film. I have another less famous film of her salary on my rent queue, the comments I first read better. Ironically, the best side of the film was his maze maze of his inner location.
