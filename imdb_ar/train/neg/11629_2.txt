** The spoilers ** KHAMOSH is absolutely unrealistic, lacks the plot, and was basically just to see the stars portray themselves. It was the most disturbing scene in the film when Shabana Azmi was in the bathroom, then we saw her TV playing a shower scene from PSYCHO. In fact, the film expected users to believe Nasir Shah's character had a memory good enough to remember where some shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer pours his sorrows into Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Nasiruddin Shah's character to run and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDES *** <br /> <br /> It's a bit funny (just a little bit) at first to hear the director and cast members who are insulting each other and hearing Shabana Azmi chanting , "Hey u!" <br /> <br /> In general, baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** Out ********** (2 of 10)
