This movie is similar to all other Dutch movies, so if you enjoy movies like turkish fruit and de kleine blonde dood. Then you may be okay with this one (although these two have stories and much better actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even this good scene ends up unrelated to telling the story. There is a lot of nudity (but I and the others have not been able to find that attractive girl), the dialogue is laughable (as we did a lot with the annoyance of other filmgoers), and some scenes are so random that this is more of an unintended comedy than anything Another (such as a random scene beats someone's owl ... has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once in a sentence saying "Have you heard what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave it is 2 because some places look nice ... that's it. The reason I saw is that we went to the sneak preview (here in the Netherlands we have a weird system for sneak previews, you pay less money then for a regular movie and you do not know the movie you're going to be all you know is that a new movie has not yet been shown in the theaters). My advice is to stay away from this movie, if you really want to watch a good Dutch movie watching temmink or zwartboek.
