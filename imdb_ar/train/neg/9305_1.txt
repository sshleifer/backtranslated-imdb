I and a friend rented this movie because it looked really good. But we were wrong. The beginning of acting .... wow ... the acting was the worst, the effects were also very bad, it looked like a movie done by a college kid. The plot was good, but it was implemented. The thing that ruined the movies most was the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... It's a shame that I describe him as a representative ... The only good thing about this film is that it was so bad and it was funny ... so if you want to laugh well see it .... but unlike So ... Stay away from this one. I usually like B-list movies, but this one ... I do not know how it was passed until it was put on the video ... that's the worst I've ever seen .. and I've seen some bad ones.
