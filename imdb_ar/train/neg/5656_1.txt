Thiab to say broth is a terrible film. This is just an overlay of the viewer without a clear link. The act is very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Izzat al-Alili. But there is something really amazing in this film, it talks about sex life, liberating women, and naked scenes are very rare in Arab cinema, even these days. I congratulate the Director and the representatives for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote on this film as a bad film are not only script and acting, but also lack of professionals. This movie looks like an amateur. We can see a lot of errors in the screen. If you want a good Arab film, Ziab la Ta'kol al lahm will not be the recommended movie.
