When I first heard about "back to earth", I was very enthusiastic. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, and was particularly hilarious in Creed. But this film proved to be disappointing. Chris Rock's performance was almost as good as his previous performance, and the film was badly directed as a whole. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously this works well in scenes that are supposed to be done in standby mode, but in the rest of the movie, it does not work. Even when talking to another character, he seems to think he is trying to laugh people. He has funny moments, but they mostly come during standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedy). As for the rest of the actors, they are there just to give a rock to someone to talk to, none of them has emerged. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie was not directed badly. The film basically contains one joke plot: an old white man acting as a young black comedian. Although I prefer movies that contain more than one joke, this was only possible to be successful and it was very funny. The problem was that we saw a lot of rock music and not enough old white man. It's supposed to be funny because this white guy tells Chris Rock jokes, but most of the time, we see Chris Rock just, so it's not funny. The few scenes that decide to show us the white man who speaks like rock, are really hilarious. If it's more played, the movie will be fun. <br /> <br /> In general, few moments of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" behaved badly, and poorly guided. This was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
