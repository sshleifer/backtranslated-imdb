Things you learned from "The List". <br /> <br /> A respected cinematographer, a wonderful acting actress and Malcolm McDowell, could not prevent this film from being sucked. <br /> <br /> The Blockbuster won will not return you money. <br /> <br /> Even when the text reads and says "Ugh! Really ?!" , Malcom McDowell still tries. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington badly needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Use the writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punishes me by paying me $ 5.50 to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> When making a movie, you do not need to end. All you have to do is leave everything unexplained, without enough resolution so that the audience does not care before the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random owner can cure death by simply painting the cross on the window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> The maid can turn you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will be disliked and ridiculed if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> Apologies will not be accepted.
