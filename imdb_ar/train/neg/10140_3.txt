This film has never been produced. <br /> <br /> What a shame on the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire hooded representatives and make a suitable movie. Plot too thin, lines are not convincing. Almost hilarious, this is a disgrace to the Action movie .... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They continue to re-run the same "snapshots" of a Stealth aircraft flying away. I've seen it and it was not worth rebooting 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It is time for Steven Seagal to retire from filmmaking. <br /> <br /> His films get worse each time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn, and Submerged were really bad, but this movie is worse.
