TV pilots, do not like them? Queen Martin tried this film after a success in a set of other television films, but this film never came except in the world of MST where he belongs. Roy Thaines is Diamond Head who receives orders from Aunt Mary to find a super spy Lovejoy, I mean a tree. Zulu and Tsu Tsing are for ethnic comedies and not much. He absorbs a tree as a bad man despite all his disguised clothes that make him look the same way he usually does. There are abnormal clothing fibers here more than you imagine (required in the 1970s) and the display itself is anti-climate. Why did not he go to the series? You know that, it's absolutely blatant. Again, it's fun to MST, but not too much !!
