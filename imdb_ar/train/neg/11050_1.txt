Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost, either by nasty programming or idle trend. This wicked robot ... musta was a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst tracks I have heard before (monologues often sink with music.) And ... where will they get their props? This boat looks like a milk carton ... I made special effects better on 8 mm at the age of 13 years! <br /> <br /> I recommend that any film student watch this click (5 minutes at a time) to learn how to make a movie. Or ... Was it the editors' fault? <br /> <br /> It's really very bad, because the script was actually a good concept ... it was poorly implemented along the way. You must have sent a "double stunt." You are a very good actor for such a foul-smelling bomb.)
