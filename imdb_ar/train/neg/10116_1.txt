I honestly want to re-post the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who is fit to watch this film is Helen Keller I kept telling myself that this should be improved. br> <br /> Then the zombie finally appeared and they had some raccoon colors on the eyes there. <br /> <br /> They talked like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Someone drove a car. <br /> <br /> I asked some voodoo what one zombie wanted and she said "zombie" (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (That's what happened) The film I made was released I could not do without it longer Can I sue for an hour of my life ?????
