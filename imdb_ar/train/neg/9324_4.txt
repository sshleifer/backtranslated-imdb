Well, I own this DVD, I've got it back on Amazon ... I mean I think that Bud and his flick and Melissa are fantastic. Polt only sucks the clown is a huge person wearing a mask and disgusting, but quite a bit if you do not want to rent a good armed flick after hard working days, but if you do not have anything else to do, answer with these stupid movies like me, Sometime, I do not know how DVD artisans have a SICK in their DVD set, sick Not good enough to be owned by a decent half-way film company Well Well that's it
