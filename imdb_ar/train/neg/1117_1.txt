I do not know what about this film, really. It's like a student's school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always dark except for seconds a day. There are long intermittent shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. What little dialogue in the film is illogical and illogical like pictures. A black woman enters the main personal apartment. Somehow they become pregnant overnight, then they are shot in the head. The main character cares about the body until it becomes a cocoon and then shows a naked white woman. I have never blown up because of how bad the film could be. Frankly, I'd like someone to watch her so they can tell me what he thinks. But I do not wish this level of hell to anyone else.
