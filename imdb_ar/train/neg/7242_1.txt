Pallbearer is very disappointing and sometimes tedious with a love story that does not work in part with casting Gwyneth Paltrow (Jolie). Gwyneth Paltrow wanders around the entire film with a puzzled look on her face and it is hard to know what David Schweimer sees. <br /> <br /> However, Pallbearer is sometimes funny especially the church scenery and group scenes with his friends laughing but basically this. Watch The Pallbearer for those scenes only and hurry forward with the rest. Trust me that you are not missing.
