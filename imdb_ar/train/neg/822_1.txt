There are really two parts of this film. First, there is a funny introduction to the film, which is hysterical and so spherical that it would be appropriate for The Simpsons' Troy McClure to do the novel. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the film begins (starting with a title song that does not really match the rest of the film) and which, though technically agreeable, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot, But the characters are meaningless. This is particularly the case with Spiventa Mickey Rooney, who was supposed to plot and part of the "organization" all the time so far what would have happened had Hakman taken an arbitrary decision to appear to take with him when going out? In this case, he would become an unnecessary and unnecessary character, which is still in the end. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the film is that it is not entirely willing to put any details about who or what behind the plot. It seems as though filmmakers did not have the courage to suggest that a particular sector of society would be able to create such an organization and instead settled in the hope that the lack of interpretation would suffice and that the public would make their own conclusions. Simply put, the film failed at all levels.
