This film did not advance in age. Perhaps the unique impact, characterization, representation and direction we saw with The Sopranos, but I saw Prizzi's Honor for the first time, on DVD alone. <br /> <br /> The viewing experience must be quite different with an audience 24 years ago, but I must say, I was terrified of the end. Not only its violence, but just the idea that this will be in a satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shock, but this seemed out of character ... Also, when was this step supposed to be set? All cars looked as if they had been since the 1960s, but the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were visible in many city views. <br /> <br /> There is another way to age the movie is bad. Just the idea that a traveler can travel from coast to coast with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> In a way, the mid-1980s found this movie charming and funny. In the mid-1980s, you know about the late huts: only who you can live.
