Many of King's fans hate this because he is away from the book, but the film is a different medium and the books must change when they jump. However, the film failed completely, but it completely failed to film terms. I want to beat people who tell me that it's the most spectacular film ever. I always follow the question "really ... exactly what is the scene that scared you?" Every fan asked, went silent. From time to time, someone, puzzled by a decent panic (there is nothing ...), named "grape juice tail - out elevators." If you are afraid of that, I do not know what I'm telling you, except that you are easily afraid. My eyes were flooded with the horrifying thoughts of terror in this unconnected film. <br /> <br /> Among the things the book deviates from the book is in fact the hard work the film does to get the master. Halloran arrives to overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the public knowing that Jack is waiting behind a pillar in the corridor required by Halloran FOREVER to walk. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, a nice choice for the works of Mr. Stanley Halloran! The black light afro nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and develop the character of the horror film. Have you ever been filming more photos in any movie ever produced? It's a really important film, given the enormous "bad will" generated by this stupid, stupid film and the cult of discontent, but the inactive fans of Kubrick, who could not describe an idea of ​​working with every film supplier in the Library of Congress before them. <br /> <br /> Take a look at Jack Nicholson's comb, insert single-mute linings at tense moments, run Razzie and perform Shelly Duvall and have a very crappy movie.
