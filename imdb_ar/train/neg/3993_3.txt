This film was exactly what I expected, not great, but not too bad. In my opinion, the PG13 movies are not scary enough, and that's why I already knew that I would be bored during the entire movie. Sure, there are scary things happening in the hotel room, but nothing we have not seen before. I think I did not like it because I thought there were a lot of twists and turns happening; I got old and repetitive. I also did not understand whether all the things that Kozak encountered in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie only continues, and when it finally ends, you want to continue it because you're still waiting for someone to tell you about the entire movie. What I did was special effects. Otherwise there was not much to enjoy. Maybe it's just me but I thought this was below average.
