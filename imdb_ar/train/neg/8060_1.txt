What a bad bad film! I tried to watch without a fast forward ... and this failed. After about 30 minutes the film was stopped, and I went online to see how many minutes of the disaster. (Only 84 minutes, wow!) It was a confusing and boring film. I do not think anyone can be beaten through a fluorescent bulb that is less touching to anyone! The only funny thing is that I watched a copy of "The Killer Cut" from the movie. The box boldly states "more blood!" "More sex!" "More terrorism than theatrical release!" Yikes! If this movie is terrible with all these claims, I wonder how lame "UN-Killer Cut" ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the dead and the dead, see the Night of the Living Dead series.
