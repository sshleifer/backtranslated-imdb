I'm not sure why this movie was announced as a wild comedy filled with laughter. There are not many things in this movie that you will enjoy watching movies and do not entertain. Annette Benning (which was described as an Oscar worthy) comes here in a nice way, with her seemingly routine performance. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and disturbing, and Major plays Augustine ?? Joseph Cross? It seems that he simply does not have a personality to do his turn. The best of the film is Ivan Rachel Wood, but it is not enough to support this boring boring film. <br /> <br /> The film quickly disappeared and seems to be a good reason. I have found some abhorrent scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and his competitors in the bathroom who have just used some of the worst scenes in "You and Me and Everyone We Know" and "Squid and the Whale"), some embarrassing, and most of them worrying. I found the whole experience a waste of time. do not waste your time?
