Well, so I'm an original fan of Wicker Man and I usually like British films that are being produced by Americans. So why do I find myself in the most painful film experiences ever? I'm not a fan of Nicholas Cage and I have a moment of madness perhaps? Awesome movie! The start of the incident / fire had nothing to do with the film at all, and the female cop knew where Edward was going, so the thing in the end with two girls visiting the mainland was not to happen when everything was being investigated. The history behind this truly evil man is not explored - and I believe that being in America did not really help in a completely debilitating subject. This film was slow and did not contain an atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best thing was finally true, when Nicholas Cage caught fire! I desperately need to see the origin again now, in order to purge my soul disappointed. I can not really emphasize how disappointed this film is, please do not see it if you are: <br /> <br /> A) I do not like remaking British British movies B) Are you a fan of the original c) Hate Nicholas Cage
