This is not a very bad film. The plot (the new house being built nearby seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is horrendous enough, and the acting is fine. The big problem I had was that I did not know Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Pix and the other shows), and I could not understand how she looked different with her big, new lips. I kept staring at them. She looks far from the place on her face! They make it look quite different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark Paul Jocielard, the actor who plays Kim's design and design his heart and soul at home, does a good job. And Lara (like Colon) is also very good (but those lips!) As a neighbor next door. Her husband Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriately wooden. The different characters living in the house were fine. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, friends (Stephen Amel), the first to go home. The attempt to involve us in the public landscape of neighbors, unfortunately, fails because other neighbors are not particularly liked. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the manager was unable to make the "haunted" house particularly bad. Other films (such as Amityville Horror and The Legend of Hell House) have been able to achieve this nervousness, but this is not happening here. The closest is when Cole paints a picture of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the distortion of the scheme that is going on with Kim, the architect. At first, he seemed to be a victim of the house like other houses (he absorbed him dry from inspiration), but later appeared to have joined his ranks in evil. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a bad horror movie if you can close your eyes to those big lips!
