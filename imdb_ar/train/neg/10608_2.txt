I do not think any film about Van Damme's will win Universal Soldier but you never know. This movie was good but not as good as the first one. Returns the Luc VD and must do battle again. He tries 2 b funny here but maybe worth laughing with a chuckle. VD has a kid this time from Ally W., well, I have shown pic of them 2. Goldberg was wonderful, he forgot his famous movement caused by "I do not watch wrestling". VD & Goldberg had some good fights. The end was like the first but not good. VD is the best player in his career, as always with HELICOPTER KICK. Although the final finish must be longer. However, it is worth watching but will not top the original.
