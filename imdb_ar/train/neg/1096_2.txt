While some of the training scenes were realistic, many of them portrayed military trainers as former Nazis. It is clear that the people who wrote the screenplay were either hostile to the army or writing a film for this audience. <br /> <br /> I am a veterinarian in Viet Nam, and even during this period, the military trainers who acted in these were probably still spending some time in the military prison. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene where the "hero" and his friend (both soldiers) sat in the captain's office, they smoked, cigarettes, talking and talking with the captain as if they were their friend. This kind of thing never happened in training or in official mode, as was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end I asked myself, "What was this film about?" It also seems to be wandering around the place without any concentration except "I hate all the power". Thank God, I got it from the library and did not pay for rent.
