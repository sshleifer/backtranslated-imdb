I was really looking forward to watching it, because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The starters were interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. He then quickly moves to the main plot, where they are attacked by a group of strangers and hits Dyer in a very bad state while Anderson is raped. Then they decided to go for some revenge. Looks good, does not it? Well, that's not the case. The story becomes boring and side-tracked, and some things become really strange. I will not give any details, but things happen, I do not want to see. I love to give all the movies the advantage of doubt, and I really wanted to admire this. It just did not work. I give it 3 out of 10, mainly for representation.
