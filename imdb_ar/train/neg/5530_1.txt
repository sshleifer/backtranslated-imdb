Among the many problems of this film, the worst is the continuity; and the re-editing of the VHS to the college cable channel many years ago, I tried to know exactly what went wrong. It seems that they have already created a much longer film and then cut it to see the standard play. how much time left? To fill all the holes in the plot as we have, it will require about three additional hours of narration and personal evolution - especially given that our film is too slow and takes itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> This is amazing; what can Halperins be trying to achieve here? Their previous film, "White Zombie," was a successful attempt at a low budget to replicate the early Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and is stuck close to zombie legends known by those in North America from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The zombie revolution, on the contrary, seems to have been intended to symbolize the politics of modern warfare. This will not only explain the opening, and change the character of Jagger's religion to paranoia, but also explains why the zombie does not actually do much in the film, besides standing around it, looks scary, and waits for requests - it's just bonded soldiers, not the non-lethal cannibals that we have become We all love her and hate her in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to anyone in my cravings for modern warfare and politics - but I think the film should be amusing first, and perhaps later, my education. And certainly - it should be a zombie film about zombie. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the most unusual films in the history of Hollywood, but not a film I can recommend, even for historical value.
