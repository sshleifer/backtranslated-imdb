Since Ragrat, from the good and funny series of cartoons, has been reduced to a modest fare and a terrible price for children two or three years old, it is clear that the tyrants of Klasky-Sisobo must be ideas. After excluding all characters, add new stupid characters, replace some voices (although I love Nancy Cartwright, they are not Chuckie Finister!), And have no sense of continuity (eg: in the episode of Kimi I watched the other day, Of Tommy and Chuckie on a new puppy; but in the next episode, the above dogs never appeared), you thought the creators could kill the show for his mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that it sucks! Although it is not as horrible as Kimi's episodes, everyone is stupid than they were, including Grandpa (oh my god! Used to be the best character in the program, but now, he has no real purpose). The end is unnecessarily thin, and the only difference between this episode and other crappy new episodes ('98 -01 ') is that children can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> There are no stars at all for The Rugrats All Growing Up. Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this offer before it becomes worse.
