I did not know if I was laughing or crying when I saw this. Only addicted addicts of danny filth can taste this. It's supposed to be a horror film but there's only filth in this. The most spectacular scene is a car accident, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this just for studies how it can be a bad movie ................
