This thought of a long-lost flick sometimes comes online. So I bought my copy. Well, acting is terrible and the storyline is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who were looking for this person also know his background. It was made by the owner of a mill cinema with a very low budget. But for me certainly did not spoil money on props but on make-up. Make-up is for this kind of well done flick. Zombies are watchale and gore intact. The only problem with this type of film is the quality of the vesicle. It's terrible, and luckily it was not a humming sound but sometimes it was too dark. So you have to watch clearly to see Gore. In a funny way they tried to sell this one as in fact not so sensitive. The soundtrack at the beginning of the film tells you to watch a banner and a man with a flash of green, telling you that there is a pall in the road. Of course that did not work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, he had this annoying bell when the red things started to flow. They had the original idea, and the meat shark was introduced a year ago. Do not go for a story, go to the zombie and note the error of continuity. When a girl and a man first make love, wear her bra, then make love and suddenly her underwear returns ... Try to do this, or do I have time without an Internet ... you eat ugly carcasses
