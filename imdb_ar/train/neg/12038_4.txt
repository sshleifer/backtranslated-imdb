Nothing happens at all in this movie. There is only the strange short scenes where I did not know what was going on in hell so it was not counted. This film is very boring, it's painful, and it comes from someone who likes it when it is about films. Confused? Well, I was after watching this crap. What Donald Sutherland had on him, because he missed him completely. And what is with the "profile" scene at the beginning of the movie. Can put anyone to sleep! 10/04
