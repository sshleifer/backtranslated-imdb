This is the most boring piece of waste I've wasted for an hour of my life. All I can say is thank God it was only one hour. More than half of this "movie" is footage taken from the original "criminal freak". At least, I've been able to see the highlights of these rare rare exploits, because for a reason that challenges the reality, my video shop only has "Criminally Insane II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this film is some of the worst home videos and movies you'll ever see. Why is my video store has this and not the original? Why do things end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and do not burn the copy immediately after seeing its sheer horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, my God, why? <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruit eating a full bar of candy in a very slow scene, or saying that the fruit is stuck from the stairway in a slower scene, or a character that is stabbed aside (do not ask) several times. Back, or a fight to kill brain cells about giving poisoned tea to his wife and then complain that all the talk has made a person's tea cools, or retarded eating a fly soup, or just want to see crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: . Repeat: You do not see this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not walk by a shelf in a video store with a copy of this movie set up. It is still possible to save you, but it is too late now. . .
