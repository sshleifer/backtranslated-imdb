There are not enough films that carry gay themes and there are not enough "out" movies. Each one is a welcome addition to this kind. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good in jeans) but it's bad. It is a piece of time: a gay life under a repressive regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems to be 40 years late from the West. In a way that we see our history, it would not have been the case for homosexuals in the 1940s and '50s (he often reminded me of "the last exit to Brooklyn: the book, not the film.) But it is very frustrating and slow in a way that caused the old SCTV to even Ingmar Bergman. It was modified very slowly, and I wonder if the director did not break randomly, yes, it was a miracle that was filmed and released before the fall of the wall and yes, life behind the curtain was difficult for homosexuals. It was good to make me a good way out of this Wonderful movies and not one of the lost films.
