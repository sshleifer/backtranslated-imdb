Manmohan Desai made some entertaining but illogical films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made some craps like COOLIE, MARD and GJS <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films he ever made. Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the film is very bad, crumbling <br /> <br /> The British make cartoons and the film is very strange. The scene in the British hotel is quite stupid <br /> <br /> The movie contains many stupid like Amrita attacking Amitabh then the entire scene plus towards the climax of the movie becomes worse there are more gems like the statue of the horse getting life, masks of Amitabha Haha and more <br /> <br /> Manmohan Desai is bad music is well done <br /> <br /> Amitabh plays his role elegantly, nothing different from Coley, roles of LAAWARIS Amrita Singh is fine Satyen Kapuu is fine Prem Chopra is fine, Rui Niruba is the usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
