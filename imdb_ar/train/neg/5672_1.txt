I am ashamed to have this film in my collection. The most redeeming factor for owning a DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My voice for this movie is ZERO BIG FAT. Do not misunderstand, I'm a horror girl. But I want some meat behind the story, not to mention I prefer the evil that happens to humans, not to be fooled into watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snails. The atrocities cross the long, painful silence and underrepresentation. If you have to compare to another movie, the only movie that comes to mind is "cannibalism". Bad, boring, useless and quite uncomfortable viewing.
