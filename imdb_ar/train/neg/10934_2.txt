First of all, let me say that I am LDS or rather, I am Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave it the benefit of doubt. I usually find something to retrieve in every film I watch. This one was no exception. Have moments of redemption. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me so much was that Halstrom seemed to be ashamed of our church! In the LDS church, gatherings are called "Annabres" and the basketball court is in the "Cultural Hall". Never once either of these two names are mentioned. The church is never referred to by name and "standards" are as much as what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> Does it make me wonder if the directors really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had a lot of potential! It was possible that our Church would appear in a positive light and help the public see not only what we offer, but also what we believe. Instead it was amusingly entertaining and leaving much to be desired. If I were not LDS already, I would be afraid that the Mormons were stupid and stupid and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's a movie I will not recommend to my friends other than LDS. <br /> </ b> Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than that!
