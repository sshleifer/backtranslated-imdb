For those of you who have never heard of it before (or seen it in A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about a psychologically overweight world, smoking Fitz and helping the Manchester Police Department access to the heads of criminal violence. Is one of the best performances that came out of England (and that's something to say) and was a huge success in England and all over the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars have re-collaborated with the original writer to hit the episode Other for two hours. I've loved this show since I first saw it, more than a decade ago. The DVD box collection has a reputation in my collection, and I can quote a large number of Fitz's interrogation scenes practically. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltran, redesigned with Jimmy McGovern for another Fitz film, filled me with sheer joy. <br /> <br /> I will start with good. One of the many things I liked about the original Cracker series was Fitz's characterization speed. Five minutes after the first episode? With his lecture (throwing books in the air), drinking it, cursing the man after him on the line of the slot machine? You know, who knows simply, who this personality was. You may feel like "clicking" in your mind, and the kind of click that happens only when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Of course, Coltran remained wonderful throughout the show but I always felt that some subsequent episodes ?? Those not written by McGovern? She abused the character. <br /> <br /> So the good news is: Fitz returned. Once you see him in this show ?? Making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter's wedding? You will feel that "click" again. It is: a fun moment, and really regret the next step, always insightful, sincere to the point of unambiguously but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as you like it, you'll be delighted with how it is filmed in the film. This extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything related to the Fitzs is handled perfectly. <br /> <br /> The problem I face with this film revolves around the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In the standard Cracker style, we know exactly who the culprit is in the first five minutes? The thrill lies in Fitz's vision. In this case, we have a serial killer out of American blood. The reason for this, unfortunately, is not because of any reasonable psychological trauma? Instead, the murders seem to be here simply to allow the writer to present his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this, because I really believe Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. I do not have a problem with movies that revolve around current issues or movies that take a political stand. But in the world of Cracker, we expect to see characters behave like humans, not like cartoons. Instead, all Americans are portrayed in this film in a perfectly stereotypical fashion. They do not know anything about everything, who complain about everything, and treat locals like nonsense and cheating on their wives ?? One of them can even do all of the above in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I changed the channels by mistake or something. <br /> <br /> But that does not stop there. Do we get constant reminders of the gravity of the war in Iraq? Reminders have nothing to do with the story and show in practice. The murderer is too busy yelling about how Bush is so much worse than Hitler that he has forgotten to continue killing. But more than that, it is the mouthpiece of the spokesman for the views of the political writer so much that he forgets to act as a reasonable person, and so we? As a public? Do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to the spirit of killing a tortured series. <br /> <br /> Can I say that this ruined the offer to me? It was still a good TV, better than almost everything else in this genre (mainly due to Coltran again). But its continued politicization made it impossible to be as good as the real Kraker classics such as "Being Someone" ?? The episode was "completely controversial", but was dealt with with greater precision and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> There are two other small points: Panhandle Not being in a place is disappointing, but what is worse is replacing them. The entire police department? Which is so full of these great characters - is now full of vanilla. Totally interchangeable policemen who lack any personality (how you can drain Richard Coyle's character Coupling is out of my will, but he is actually missing here). <br /> <br /> Also, there are moments when the show has lost its credibility to me. One of these cases is that Fitz has to narrow the entire population of Manchester from one million to one hundred, based on some strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?)? He not only succeeds in doing so, but succeeds in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I was a bit disappointed. Recommended to watch, but remember to leave some of your expectations at least at the door. However, if there is a new series that will follow, all were for good: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and perhaps now that he has ruled out his system, he can go back to writing about people.
