Susan Seidlman seems to have had a decent life with a few of the first-class credits under her belt. I'm certainly happy to have bounced off this movie that he seems to admire. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen acting in high school plays better than acting in the Smithereens. The plot is like participating a young Susan Berman ambitious to make her into the music world and willing to do anything to get there. She refuses even the sincere progress of a young artist who lives outside his truck off the east river of Brad Ryan. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ryan contributes to the worst performance in the film, and is actually one of the worst jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder it did not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Sidman's eye for the camera is a good idea to capture the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly filmed. But her work with her live artists did not rise. I'm not sure that it has a lot of raw materials that work with it. <br /> <br /> See quickly and you'll see Christopher Knuth very young before law, order and sex in the city as her street companion. br> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit in this audio track. I'll stick to Bing Crosby.
