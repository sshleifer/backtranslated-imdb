There is a great level of expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with actors headed by Carrie Grant, Jane Mansfield, Ray Wallston, and Warner Klemperer. These expectations are further enhanced when the film is directed by Stanley Donin, whose comic touch was very clear, among other things, DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes, or so, these expectations seem to be realized then? nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, sinking into a prolific melodrama of bullets, with a chuckle that must have been exposed. <br /> <br /> The new relativist Susie Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of it, in this film, but in a film in which even the big Cary Grant appears flat and grainy, the attack on Parker seems unfair. There was not even a bright light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have altered the riches of this dreary, bleak and useless text, which attracts itself with the utmost magnificence and draws the viewer's attention and patience with him. <br /> <br /> The cast, particularly Ray and Sixty, are still trying to breathe life into the proceedings, but the terrible scenario goes beyond recovery. Unusual efforts to attract laughter from the heart of the deceptive audience in the final moments of the film only add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
