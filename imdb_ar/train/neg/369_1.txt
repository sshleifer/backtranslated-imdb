I almost contacted HBO and asked my money back for this month just because it was broadcasting this movie. I can only see the movie that is going on and he is sitting. "Well, we need to get something like Home Alone. We'll just add a bunch of money to the kid, hire representatives at a discount, and oh yeah, we'll make it less funny!" Well, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what I got here. Not even worth knowing if someone else is renting it. As a children's film? forget that. I will not allow my children to see this, not necessarily because of the bad jokes, but because I do not want them to say, "What were you thinking of showing us this lame piece of garbage, Dad?!?"
