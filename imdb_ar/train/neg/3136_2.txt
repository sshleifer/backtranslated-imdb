There is a lot of obvious noise associated with this film. Let's just face it, though the main reasons why anyone will see it will be Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they're scared in this film. The special effects were decent (I would say that filmmakers did a good job of satisfying the ship), but even IT has many major drawbacks. For example, before you start the ship directly, you can see an incomplete blue image on the screen behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love REAL Titanic, but I find this film an insult to that story. The editing process was terrible - there was no reason for any film for more than two and a half hours (except for MAYBE's autobiography), writing and writing the script was horribly frightening. <br /> <br /> I will say that the music was probably better than I expected (not just the song "My Heart Will Continue"). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship drowns and hears bass music. Can be a good highlight of the film. The mood was very boring. I felt more relieved than grief when Jack died, whom I know could not be what the director meant. <br /> <br /> In the shell of a gun, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful Titanic story into an overheated flick chick story.
