Do not start me. <br /> <br /> After many years of publishing on IMDb, I never thought I would watch such a bad film that I really wanted to get a rating of less than one film. I have always found a reason or at least two reasons to see merit - if only in the intention or effort of the writer, director, crew or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, they are "with all the same person (!) who really needs to deal with the truth, at least as evidenced by this worthless waste of the video, that he has no talent. It is reasonable if this "produced" some junior high schoolers in his first film class, but the "artist" referred to behind this wreckage was twenty-six when the abortion took place. <br /> <br /> How was this made in their minds? Moreover, do not let the box cover fool you: there is not even anything remotely like a good sex scene or any good "exposure" to the big piece on this The cover. <br /> <br /> There are two last elements: one second when this "movie" has recaptured the value: "The Talent" mentioned above gets it from his mistress ... I heard one thing from this film. The times when something is so bad that it is really very funny but not by any comical way it's just a humorous sense of humor.
