First, the film, according to Baqa'a, said it won the Best Film award at the Worldfest Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must be a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I would not call this movie the worst movie ever, but it certainly sucks it, pretty awful like the other Aussie B actress "Body Melt", but at least this did not seem like the movie was filmed on HI 8 . <br /> <br /> I think filmmakers have seen a lot of Troma and Gore films really bad, believing they can also break the works that make this film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love really low-grade movies, just the fact that some characters put on fake American accents, as if doing so would give them more opportunity to sell in the states or something. The end is really disappointing, the confrontation may be more exciting, some good fighting scenes. You can see completely that filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" in its entirety, a car bomb, a rocket launcher, and an endless amount of people being shot, yet the end does not lack any kind of humor, "Taste." <br /> <br /> If you like to watch really bad gore movies, or you're interested in making movies without a budget, watch them or stay away from them.
