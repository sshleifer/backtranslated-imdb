As a representative, I really like independent movies, but this film is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Fairmont for civil service after the plane lands on a palm tree - were the filmmakers aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pine Yes - palm no. And the same for the wedding service - again a beautiful orchard of palm trees. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they seem unable to get a ticket on any major airline because the plane that was filmed is Federal Express. Have they shipped themselves overnight in a cage? Come guys guys small details like this film is completely separate from amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much more like Arthur with his white hair and tribal bandage. The two must have changed roles. <br /> <br /> The funny characters are superfluous and terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause to the directors to make a gay movie but you have to pay attention to your positions and casting the next time
