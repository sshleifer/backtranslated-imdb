The "American nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, to "It's over!" For the worst film ever. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely like the K-Mart version of "Friends") meet in a cafe to listen to the American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. Hosted by a man with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of his program. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joy and ... Oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jesse, and the rest of the bad gang that outperform each of them turns revealing their biggest fears to be weary Ji. Without their knowledge, you will hear a crazy nurse / serial killer ... <br /> <br /> Then the nurse's madness continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... Wait, sorry again ... by making their fears come alive. These concerns include people like Voodoo and are exposed to older women with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Oh really. <br /> <br /> This movie, in one word, was corrupt. Crazy Nurse's killing spree is lacking motivation, and there is nothing to make the viewer "jump", end strikes, and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you do not have any consideration at all for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little - go to the local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in the freezer.
