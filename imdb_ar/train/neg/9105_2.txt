What can I say about the cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say, I'll only watch this movie again if I'm fixed on a chair and my eyes open around the clock in the style of an orange. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Stars" is Robin Donne (no, I never heard of him), which made me feel terrible about Ryan Phillip. In case of an awesome situation, Dunne tries (and fails) to continue to play an attractive and attractive character. Since the actor is not handsome, attractive or charming, I left the character completely unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was once in a series of craps), is trying to capture the place where Sarah Michelle Gillard stopped and brings Catherine to the planning ... However, Adams is not a good actress and her performance is flat and lacks any real feelings, Cue cards were read away from the camera. However, there were two good actors in the film, Saw 2 & Saw 3 and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion Powers), who performed very well and was very sexy as my parents, Sebastian and Katherine, the only reason I rated the film It's 2, not 1. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a poor version of the original, with such reductions as carbon copy of the dialogue and simulation scenes that lack the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think that as a TV show, it may be successful, but if it is redrafted with people who can actually act in the main parts.
