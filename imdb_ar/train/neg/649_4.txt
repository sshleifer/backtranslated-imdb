Well, I've been making this movie for one reason and just one reason to make money !! Did you know that this movie will be absorbed once it becomes a PG-13 number of slashers movies pg-13 showing that it is good? So like asking how many women were on the moon? The answer is nothing !! The 1980 night concert was fantastic, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a sponsor who stays the same and tries to be anything more. <br /> <br /> My problem with the prom night 2008 is how it deals with the killer and I have 3 big problems with him ..................... <br / > <br /> 1) The way he escapes, I've been locked up in a mental institute and fled through an air conditioning hole !! what a hell? Why do they have air vent in the patients' room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain The killer wants all the main victims family and friends dead so he can get everything for himself and say he loves her but the next moment tries to kill her, so he wants to kill her, love her or just rape her ?? 3) The killer is very good, how he developed all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this only scene in which his main victim kills her while sleeping on her head asleep and she does not notice it, all that ridiculous 2 star out of 10 awesome, silly and stupid attempt in the horror film
