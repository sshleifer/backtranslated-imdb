Fashion, dialogue, terrible historical precision. For example, - Stacy Dash and the hanging scene. The noose was delicate (as I can say), but this kind of breach breaks the person's neck. Mrs. Dash was left hanging at the end of the rope without any traces until the rope was shot. This kind of person did not suffocate the person, he killed them at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> Before they steal a bank (earlier), they temporarily stopped in the street for a collective hug - with their gangs hiding their faces - it could have been obvious to people on the street. <br /> <br /> The weak adjustment - a battery under this shirt is clear, a clip showing them the "long journey" they ride, and then reflect the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking crap - it looked symbolic. The entire film was folly.
