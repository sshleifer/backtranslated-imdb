We were given this one star movie only because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for repeating any organism. In their own lab (running warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies stormed to steal the formula and the rest of the movie is an endless foot hunt. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (rubber doll) is lost and begins to erase the cast. It has an amazing ability to sneak within two or three feet without being noticed and then bites their heads immediately. <br /> <br /> One of the actors escapes in a police car and spends the rest of his film while driving aimlessly through the city. They are so intellectually powerful that they can not even turn on the radio. She never tries to drive the car to a substation or a cake shop and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex is wreaking havoc throughout the city, there are gun battles and burning buildings (cardboard models) blowing up, but one police car, or army, and no one else shows up at all. This activity should be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that the sequel is unplanned.
