What a disappointment! I hated the mummy but this was worse! It was exhausting and unbelievable, and at one point, I found myself sighing and bawling all the time. I can not believe that people already liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a great tour across America's most wanted buildings. The steady flow of tips and fixtures was not convincing either. The attention stopped about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a good night outside became a complete disappointment. What an audacity ... I think I've just seen a lot of films to enjoy national treasures.
