I was interested in seeing this move believing it might be Massa's in RAW, but the only thing I found was bad writing, terrible guidance (the sequence of the shot does not flow) although the director may say that this is what it seems to be uninspiring and immature too . It was possible to make the adjustment by anyone who had two video and had a low budget video inventory. I would say that it was not something as simple as a mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix a movie that has a director, like editing, but obviously does not care. There is a lot of effort in this film such as pork sandwich. It can be better, but that means extra work.
