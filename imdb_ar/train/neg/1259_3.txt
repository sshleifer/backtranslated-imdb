Thank you Hollywood. After another classic film completely destroyed by the cheap remake, shallow, heavy and redundant effect. The original "Planet of the Apes" was a smart, thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film that was almost entirely focused on dialogue, which seemed very boring but in fact very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to have canceled all dialogues. Instead of a wonderful movie, we get a stupid chase movie for an unbelievably two hours. Dialogue has been reduced to a minimum, and the interaction and development of personality is absent, and in most cases it is very difficult to know what is going on. Instead, we get a bunch of stale animation scenes, some ridiculously funny conversations and some very semi-smart conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely wonderful. The makeup of the monkeys is wonderful, collections and backgrounds are also beautiful. However, this does not distract attention from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simple film, full of thin paper characters, stupid dialogue and almost no conspiracy. Please Hollywood, stop destroying wonderful movies by turning them into unsurpassed movies. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the end did not make any sense whatsoever. <br /> <br /> * Of stars, especially for images <br /> <br />
