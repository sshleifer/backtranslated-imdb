I managed to get a view of this with the help of MST3K, and boy, even with the presence of this film was so bad. Imagine someone who can be assigned a camera by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (of which there were few) came from special effects, which were OK. The representation for the most part was also OK. Although there is nothing special, it was higher quality than the other B-Movies movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is very bad and it seems that the action of the camera mostly has just been put by the camera man on the ice skating and pushing it along. The story (if it can be called) is full of holes, it's almost funny, it never explains why hell stays in the first place, or needs a human body to survive. The script is badly written and the dialogue is about stupid plane. The climax of the film (if there is one) is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the version of MST3K, avoid it at all costs.
