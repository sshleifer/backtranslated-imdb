At least, not full of violence or fuzz. Nor is it full of thought or a smooth story. This story had some potential but the director seemed to have lost his green position. The story is disjointed and set off in strange directions, to no avail. I also do not think the director spent too much time at the rustic golf club as well. Some pictures are silly. Not very attractive.
