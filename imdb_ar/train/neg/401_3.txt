This is what I found myself saying again and again in the third ineffective act of this unfortunate excuse for a film. First, computer effects are blowing at all! These computer wizards really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the film, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters behave in a realistic way, especially in the above-mentioned third act (I promise that I will not abandon it, but trust me, !). Lots of laughter in the film comes unintentionally, as when they try to explain that the invisible man's eyelids do not work. Please give viewers more credit! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What will you do, after all, if you are invisible? No one can catch up with you! These issues were dealt with much more intelligently in the 1933 film The Invisible Man. One scene of violence in particular is incredibly mysterious and is not mentioned later. If more attention has been paid, the crazy world of Kevin Bacon would have been more logical. <br /> <br /> The film will actually be more successful as pornographic, where the hypothesis can be performed in a unique and interesting way. But this piece of work ... go to see something else. Or not, live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
