A terrible film is supposed to be an independent film. He needed some reliance on something. <br /> <br /> This utterly depressing film deals with interactions among Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film "Crash?" If so, this movie has been completely disabled. <br /> <br /> There are too many events here that culminate in a little guy who was running and throwing stones at buses and cars that clearly caused chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is too intermittent to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister was torn by the suitor. This causes the former sister to become bitter and walk around in clothes she does not deserve to believe in. The older sister becomes bitterness but soon find romance. <br /> <br /> Then, we have 3 losers who buy masks to steal a bank. The theft is obviously running out but there seems to be no punishment for the fraudsters. Perhaps, the punishment should have been on the book for their failure to create a coherent film.
