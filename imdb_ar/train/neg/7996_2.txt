Is there a book entitled "How do you make a film with everything you imagine" man vs. nature "vulgar"? If not, the ants would make an excellent source material for separation on deadly insects. The ants does not have one piece of originality to be found at any time of the run time of 100 minutes. I suppose the most amazing thing about ants is that they actually stretched the movie to 100 minutes. Were the setup, characters, various sub plots, death scenes, and how to present ants before any number of times? In most cases, much better. It is amazing that many of these insects on Rampage films were produced in the 1970s because they are all basically the same film. <br /> <br /> Can someone tell me what myrna Loy is doing in the name of god this monkey feces film? Worthy of a talented and elegant woman like Loi better than ants as one of her last films.
