I went to see this one with lots of expectations. Unfortunately, the dialogue is quite stupid and the film is far from magnificence or attention. Even the child can see the lost logic of the personality behaviors. Today's children need creative stories that inspire them, making them "daydreams" about events. This is exactly what happened with movies like E.T. And Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children did you imagine becoming Jedi Knights and flaring their lights?) Seriously do not waste your time and money in this.
