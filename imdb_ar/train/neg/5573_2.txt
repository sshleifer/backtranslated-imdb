I can not understand at all why many of Godzilla's fans believe this is excellent, and it is one of Godzilla's best films ever. This movie is terrible and one of the few Gojira movies that I can not see again (the other is G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is very artificial in the Heisei series, a series that tried to convert the old Godzilla franchise into action movies, revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than in 1991. It seemed ridiculous, Some subjects, for example the WW2 scene, with the Japanese soldiers praised Godzylazoros, a sad and dangerous tone, took the former leader to become a capitalist and his death, which is seen in a film referred to by his fans in some way as a laughing game, as a stupid full of fun Irrational, if so more than this easily one of the most films I have seen tasteless, But I think it was probably a talent that filmmakers lacked, and that was the case for a straight-faced movie. It has gotten worse with the fact that the special effects are very terrible compared to the auction, from the aircraft packages to the Android system, to the sound effects that emit everything, it is impossible to take anything seriously, however the film expects you, there is no sign To the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost all the Godzilla movies, there is a meaningless love story, which is no exception, although one can say something about the fact that this film is useless and inexplicable. There is absolutely no reason at all for romance, it just happens and there are 360 ​​degree pledges for it. Apart from this, the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue, both Japanese and English are horrifying, bloggers, and perhaps a source of inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The DVD of Tristar doubles the problems, and makes everything look likable, blurred, bleak and just ugly, it was the same for the sound. I saw for the first time the release of the Japanese Zone 2 and the differences at night and day, with the vibrant colors and vibrant texture of the original, the remarkable result, and the scenes of fighting in particular, in fact observable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is disappointing, except for Goodzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little praise here, and Godzilla against King Guidora is an example of this failure. So they do not come close to the reputable and fans that you get. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
