I have noticed that this film has borne the brunt of a lot of insults. Maybe gain some of them, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to watch this movie again. It was a bad film. But I do not hate this film, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film can work very well indeed. I just think that the directors misjudged the way they should do this (they had to add more funny bits if they wanted to be a comedy). With rewriting, it could have been a wonderful movie. But, as satire, it did not succeed in its current form - many scenes did not fit into the context of the scheme: for example, the scene of theft does not make sense in the story. However, it was not the worst independent film ever created - is it in the Top 10 worst? This is debatable.
