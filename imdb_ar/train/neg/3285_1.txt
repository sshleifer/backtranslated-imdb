When a movie like The Dukes of Hazzard brings in more than $ 75 million, it makes some incredibly sad statements about the state of our society. Either we are too stupid to get away from garbage like this or perhaps do not realize how many people like this kind of trash effortlessly. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has no incentive to make good movies because if it gets out the trash, people will see it anyway because there's nothing else on the screen. This is so. I came out despite receiving a free movie permit. Dialogue can not be more stupid. Thrills can not be more exciting and outrageous. Perhaps this is the "biggest size" picture of the Texans but it does not appeal to me or anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" was in the dust of the profession, except for Bert Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I will not even recommend this movie to the video, even if you are desperate. This was all about fooling the public to earn enough money after opening to become equal or better than its cost through marketing. They did despite the public warning. Stupid and plentiful.
