I saw that Gary Bossi and Fred Williamson thought they were policemen. They exist but Busey in the opening scene, then do not show again until up to 40 minutes in the film. Although every scene is wonderful. Especially when disguised as a vagrant blind. <br /> <br /> What is true in this film is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who is stalking and killing sex operators over the phone. At one point I think this is bussy. But it turned out that I was only partly right. Bossi is not the killer, but he is related to women and harasses her by phone. why? I do not know, I do not know. It's not in any way connected to the killer, he does it just for the kicks I think.
