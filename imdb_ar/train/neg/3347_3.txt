I'm not sure why I love Dolph Lundgren. I think his vision on the screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some other reviews point to the extent of dumb detention, but many neglect points to positives. <br /> <br /> Any movie that kills at least one annoying teenager will not be bad. Why do many movies with a group of teenagers always need to include teenagers in stereotypes? Are not there any other kind of teenagers? Does every group of teenagers have an angry black man? Nerd genius no one likes? One girl very whore-friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? A white child is annoyed by an antagonistic society from a broken house that everyone agrees is talented (but what talent?). A relaxed black child who harmonizes with the universe and is so gentle that all other nervous children trust him. Then add a few general consumable teenagers of any color. They do not say much but they get shot at some point. <br /> <br /> Detention was better if the bad guys blew up the school. Preferably with the book inside. The dialogue is bad and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and girl) finally kidnap a car full of drugs, they sit inside the truck. They drive the truck to school because they want to repaint the truck at the school paint shop, but they never walk around to repaint the truck. By the way, it was just easier to put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another car or truck and get away without repainting the police truck. It does not transfer drugs, sell them or do anything else. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decided that they should kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even though when the bad guys take control of the school, no one realizes it remotely because it's after school hours. A handful of people who are still in school have nothing to do with car paint, so why are we chasing them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this film is that the bad guys are all armed with a lot of machine guns, they continue to find teenagers (including the man in a wheelchair) and continue firing hundreds of bullets in teens and usually miss . Near the end of the film, there is some bloodshed. Every time someone is shot at, there must be at least 300 bullets fired. Erotic very bad. <br /> <br /> I read one review that says this movie has a budget of $ 10 million, and I'm surprised. When I saw the film I figured, Lundgren might have done his charity work to some of the film schools where he worked as a teacher. Like this film may have been the end of the year exam. It was a test to watch, but I passed.
