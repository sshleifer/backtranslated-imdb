I'm sorry but that's just awful. I have told people about this film and some of the bad behavior in it and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with this idea, as Japanese troops are withdrawn in modern times to the days of the Posido warriors and their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When troops realize that something strange is happening, should everyone at the back of the transport say, "My hour stopped?" Imagine lines like this repeated 15 times before you say anything else and you have a brief lack of greatness in the film.
