It's a pity that you can not vote zero stars on IMDb, because I will not hesitate! In fact I will go so far as to say that this film was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I bought this movie believing that because Michael Madsen was there, it might be good ... no chance! This movie was awful! Imagine the length of "The Bold and the Beautiful", well, Primal did not come close to that, and I had thought before that there would be nothing worse than the length of "The Bold and the Beautiful." <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this to us? The worst of it is that I did not move a little bit, I hoped they would finally reveal that it was a sick joke, and they thought it would be funny to see a terribly bad film. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half a Star, Graphic Design - Half a Star, DVD - Half a Star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to watch bad movies just so you know a really bad film for that reason, I'm glad I saw this movie, so I have a bad movie I put at the bottom of my list.
