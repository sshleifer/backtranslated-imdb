In fact, this click, made in 1999, has good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is no group of clowns running away, spending hundreds of rounds, but not catching meat. There are no car chase / accidents where the beautiful machines worth thousands of dollars are useless. <br /> <br /> The interior designs are modern in a respectful and architectural style, and equipment looks to snuff. Well, there's a high-tech computer room with food-like stuff from the electronics lab in the 1950s. The make-up pie on the corpses cracked me. The pie is not a make-up in the traditional sense, but what looks like a dried pancake is a loose mixture on the exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that objects have been calcified - although the way the virus will accomplish this transformation is an exercise that leaves the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the worst rationale for science fiction, but I can not. A computer virus that travels through a television screen (or computer screen) and becomes a deadly biological nurse? Give me time to rest. Warp "Star Trek" leads one thing, but photons become viruses? This very ridiculous "fear factor" required only can not be achieved. The click could have used one of these terrible dreams when the dead come alive, or there is a cat jumping out of the closet, or something, because the viral thing does not. <br /> <br /> One assumes that Robert Wagner had the same excuse to play in this madness that Lord Oliver gave to some of his subsequent places and garbage. He needed money. No other comparison should be made between the two.
