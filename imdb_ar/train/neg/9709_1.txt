After 30 seconds of opening credits, I felt this would be a bad film, but I did not know how bad it was. Then the actor who plays the role of the evil Nazi world opens his mouth and my friend decides that in order to survive this movie, we will have to lower the volume and configure our dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But that did not help. About half way through we turned it off. Now, I've lived some very bad movies before, with and without the help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are some movies I doubt that Bots can provide. The biggest part of the film that bothered me the most was that the sleeping people to believe that they were zombies rubbed the green skin. I think they are all hypnotized to death, then sleepy to rot themselves. Stick to the classic B-movie cult story like "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
