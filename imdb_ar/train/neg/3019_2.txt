How can you take the story of a fiercely violent and brilliant reward hunter with that accent? This is ridiculous. Apart from that, the visual style of the director is nauseous and exotic, the plot is a narrow rephrasing of the bands of shallow, boring and distorted bands, and the representation is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters throughout the film and is told with a fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confusing. The film ever shows you things do not actually occur, then says later "This has not already happened, this happened" - witness (apparent) killing (ladies) I (fake). What did we see in the first sequence of wrong and wrong events? <br /> <br /> The terrible choice to cast their vote, a tortuous and chaotic plot and a guiding style stimulates headaches. 1/5.
