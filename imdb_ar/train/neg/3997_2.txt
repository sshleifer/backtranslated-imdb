After discovering the high rating on IMDb, I decided to go watch this movie. After this high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean list, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my evaluation, you can see that I am disappointed. I enjoyed developing the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to talk to him from entering the hotel room. By the time Inslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolate appears on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin responds in a reasonable manner. He is terrified. I have been encouraged and think for myself, this will be good. People who made this film realize that their number is less. <br /> <br /> But what happened next was great. Raqqa is quickly replaced by a predictable gun approach ... just blow the audience with every scary trick in Hollywood and hope something works. To see, the radio clock works on its own? Well, that's always scary. Things that move in the room? Well, you can not complain about it. Blood dripping from walls and drowning? Great. Ghosts commit suicide? Hassan. any thing else? What about high noise, shaking, fire, more shaking, tampering with the room, more blood, etc. All this is good. All this has been done before. I am exaggerating our dysfunctional audience because of the lack of attention with all sorts of things in a quick sequence, and they will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. You know what? When I go to watch a horror film in a play, it is usual to hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fright at frightening moments. But this film did not have scary moments. The audience was silent and uninterested. I did not feel any cold down the spine. nothing. The Shining was 100 Ã— what this film is trying to be. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people who say it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just do not understand it.
