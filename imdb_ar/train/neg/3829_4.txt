The stolen train thief breaks the days of his serial gang and his head to the retired customer responsible for his wife's murder (as well as the hidden gold hideout still hidden by the screenwriter). Trying to make this Western type violent and brutal like the 1970s, not even in the same association of some Westerners with new fangs who came out of the late 1960s. It is simple and impossible to square, with female characters only turning into punching bags and potential rape victims. As the former police chief, Charlton Heston offers one of his most lazy and least inspiring performances (he has a good moment, trying to read a message and feeling his glasses). James Coburn, as half of a non-crazy breed, is largely associated with spontaneous experimentation, but Coburn has a way of turning even the most vicious dialogues and situations into a thorny and troubling thing. He's introduced along the way. * 1/2 of ****
