I wanted to give this movie zero but this was not an option !! This movie sucks! Women can not act. I should have known that he would suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house believed that I did not change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black females as a weapon in Western days is a silly idea. It's not just sweat, it's also sex. Combining the two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry that some people in the film are not bad actors / actresses but the film itself was bad and was not as credible as a film. It may be "amusing" for a certain group of people but I am not in this group. Haha. Using a wonderful collection of wonderful wonderful movie ... "That's all I'm saying about it."
