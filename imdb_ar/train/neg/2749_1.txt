This film was very badly written. The characters have no depth. They were not supposed to make such a film. My 11 year old son can write a better script then Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who has not been absorbed is the zoo keeper. I've been the only funny person and certified among many. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to give them the benefit of doubt, but that figure was there in a lame list in figure 2. Figure 1 Be demonic. <br /> <br /> For those who thought you were a good movie, you are in dire need of brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the film were not even the Dragon ... so why call the war?
