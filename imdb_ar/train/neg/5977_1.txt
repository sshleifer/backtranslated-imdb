Wonderful. So I do not remember much about this film, but it is difficult. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; the girl's parents neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one who bothered me? Then, this eccentric PokeMon kidnaps my ash mom to pretend she is the girl. I do not care if he tries to make the girl happy, that's just careless. <br /> <br /> There was no real conspiracy. The girl was just a light naughty who wanted things in her own way. She played with the Unowns, and was the "daughter" Entei, and it seems she can grow and shrink in age for a whim with the help of "Dad". <br /> <br /> That's all I can remember, but I think you can take as a tip, not see it. (Or if you do not see it, do not expect too much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, hire "PokeMon; First Movie".
