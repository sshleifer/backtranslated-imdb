Some news correspondents and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about the zombie epidemic, despite "government control of the media." The filmmakers do not understand that the films of Romero Romero are working only because he skillfully kept his policy in the background of most of his films ("The Land of the Dead"). This spell is just as hidden as a brick on the face or a bullet in the head is more opaque to this scenario. What is subversive or hidden from seeing a military man masturbating to death and destruction? Any simple thing about the various commercials that are overlapping with the movie? Both. Moreover, the representation is horribly uniform, the characters are completely unpopular, the plot is stunning. Add all this and you have the worst zombie movie incompetent since then, "C.H.U.D. 2" raised his ugly head. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
