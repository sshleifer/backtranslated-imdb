Released in 1965, but clearly filmed years earlier, it is a small incompetent melodrama with some inefficient sexual exploitation in the foreground. As usual for grindhouse jokes from the era, there is a fair amount of undress and undressed clothing supplemented by lousy music, annoying narration, and embarrassing editing. The cafe scene puts the tragic foundations, where we take back and forth between the characters to avoid seeing them actually talking about their lines. All we get is the reaction footage on the character voice outside the screen! The 50-year-old Misty Ayers stripped her French underwear several times before the activity began. They are constantly accompanied by music stored apparently from romantic to western to mixed mothers, and are randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever. Watch as he taps it! Watch as he hits the game! Do you inhale or be captured by Apache? Only time can prove !! The film tells a wise story of how Sally was tricked into working in a whorehouse, drugged, unable to escape. For some reason, we dealt with some of the most boring and boring prostitutes ever committed to the film, literally using their fingernails or knitting rather than entertaining customers. Some comedy is incredibly lame (Boozy lady drinks milk accidentally! Har dee har!) The silent movie does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I have ever seen, even in a video "Something Strange". It's really a cinematic curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema - very bad cinema.
