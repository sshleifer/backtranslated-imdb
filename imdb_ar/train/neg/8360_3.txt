What do you like about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's color! <br /> <br /> It contains some impressive underwater photos! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is accelerated! Especially when the shark or bad guys are about to move! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is slowed down! As if to communicate with the audience, it is time to empathize! <br /> <br /> As one bites the dust! As if in the "Western spagetti" this is very much like! <br /> <br /> Not that Italians can not produce high-quality products! There was a series of television films entitled "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, which was shown on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on Mafia-type conflicts! They were excellent! But unfortunately, you will not find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was made in the 1960s! Sadly it was 20 years old, as seen from the funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was a sharp bite of quick sharks that cause red dust that repeatedly erupts in bluish water! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this, whether in a bar fight or watching the last bloody demolition of the sea by the hungry shark relentlessly, the hero's companion looks at his little-eyed glasses, as if he is also bored by his role Which is relentless amid the lack of much evidence of a conspiracy or personal evolution of anyone! <br /> <br /> At least, the hero points to a quick, late concern for his former wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if music fails to wake us up, we have a wicked voice in the voices of the bad guys, as if we were pushing another dark job about to emerge! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of evolution! Only when we thought it was all perfectly expected! But do not get upset, people, you may find another twist! If you watch closely! To, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and eat some beer along the way! Watching "Night of the Sharks" will make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> After that, you'll be ready for something like "007" to make your return to reality when this is over !!!
