When I saw this film cover, I first thought it was made for the video. The second thing that comes to mind is how similar this is to another terrible film "Darkness Falls", the tale of this stupid witch that killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a great masterpiece compared to this garbage heap, and the film was not supposed to be made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a small backgammon story, or a meaningless introduction to two young children who will go to meet a toothpick in the hope of giving them a shiny new bike for their teeth. The opening was poorly filmed, and like the rest of the film, it certainly is not scary. At present, the film revolves around Peter (Luclin Monroe). Peter rented his house and former girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and her daughter Cole to be there. Cole meets a child in the neighborhood, talking about "Fairy Teeth", how you should not lose your teeth, or they will come for you. Unfortunately, seconds later, the Tooth Fairy seems to steal its bike and get out of its teeth (how ironic). Will Cole will survive the wrath of Tooth Fairy, and her mother and Peter will be able to save her and revive their romantic relationship ... This is a bad film, perhaps you can discover it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this stupid movie is how unknown tooth fairy. They say they kill you if you lose your age, but no. It's like a serial killer who kills at random, and if you lose your age, you'll definitely go. She steals a bike, so she seems to be a thief too. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this film was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy look? To see. She looks like a burned-out victim, who once roamed the neighborhood to slaughter children. Hmmm ... It seems as if she is running out of time for Freddie Krueger from "Nightmare on Elm Street". This is not the worst part of this terrible mess, the climax is. This movie may have a laughable climax (not literally funny because I found it more disturbing than funny) I've ever seen it. Do not see this. <br /> <br /> Just small vanities. Luchlin Monroe was in Scary Movie, and Gianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, both of whom were, so the Scary Movie stars seem forced to end their careers with scary, bad films. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 80 minutes. R violence.
