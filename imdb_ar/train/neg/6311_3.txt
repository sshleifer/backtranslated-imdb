It's a very bad and bad film. <br /> <br /> Well, for people, the real realistic film is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, bad, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say this movie is real. <br /> <br /> There are many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are doomed to and cursed, all you will do is finish shooting or being shot by someone; do not let children play with weapons, Then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that, I have never seen such a bad movie. Maybe that's why I never noticed the importance of photography itself is important in the film. In this scene, every scene being filmed in the day, outdoors, blue and clearly annoying. They did not even care about correcting the color balance. Oh! Over 300 movies have been "classified" into this database so far, and this is (3/10) the least.
