The first one was the best. The second sucks because the dialogue was terrible. Although the story story was not too bad (in fact, all the story lines are good and bad). Throughout the film, I pumped several times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert, but she is not a good actor at Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good. Zhang Zhi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible representation (but this depends on the text). All characters were not good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always erotic scenes and less sex. I know that Jackie Chan does not do those things that are good for him.
