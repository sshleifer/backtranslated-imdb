Users who rated this movie can not see enough good movies to compare. Were all their brains washed? I was rarely disappointed with the film, and some of it should be attributed to the funny noise surrounding this film. <br /> <br /> From the first, BU is a chasing film. We pick it up at the end of the chase and go straight to the other. And another. And another. And another. Do you see the emerging pattern? Do not waste time almost on the plot or personal development or old boring reality. <br /> <br /> If you do not see my other Bourne movie, you'll lose a lot. If you have - you just wish to be lost - somewhere away from the cinema. <br /> <br /> The style of Paul Greengrass was very well sympathetic to United 93, which was an excessive burden of feeling desperate, but Bourne and his endless problems had the effect of removing the public from sharing personality. he runs. He jumps. It punches. Explodes. He surveyed high buildings. Yada Yada Yada. Above all - he survives. Like Najat Action, he survived plastic, making the ironic, ironic works that attract him more and lack any kind of tension. So is he driving a building? So what? He will survive. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There is a girl thrown in the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but it is just a decor. I have seen more personal depth and sudden dialogue in Captain Scarlett's episodes. <br /> <br /> Bourne's journey of self-discovery is no doubt endless and does not tell us anything we did not know from the first film. It has become a killing machine. Great deal. He discovered his true identity. So what? It does not have any emotional resonance when it comes to it. <br /> <br /> The end of the 'twist' is telegraph and weak. Dear, whenever you think about this movie whenever you hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 while writing this review! It is better to finish now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I like the flick for good work and I love good excitement. Bourne's warning is not. It is a high and boring series of brilliant alterations, funny sound effects and animation violence. <br /> <br /> The notion that it "shows the way" to the Bond franchise is nonsense. Casino Royale blows out of the water.
