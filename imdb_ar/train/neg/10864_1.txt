The reason I intended to give this film a chance to take two hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and hope to appreciate Indian cinema. All I've seen in my life is a few old movies for S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Surfing through IMDb I came across this movie and after I saw an 8.7 rating, I concluded that this is a movie that will unlock unknown doors and bring artistic enjoyment. Oh my how wrong you are! The only logical explanation for this assessment of 8.7 is that more than 970 people voted for Indians and their only project outside Bolliwood's production was Adam Sandler's films. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this film will be ranked 9th in IMDb, the top 250 films on Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in a mood to review and criticize her because there is nothing I find worth recalling from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are a lot of Hindus who like me find this movie as it is - stupid plain, with an abundance of falling music and cheese music.
