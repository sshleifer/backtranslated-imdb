This movie is awesome. In the end, you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life and you can not return to it. "Twist" termination is very contrived. The evolution of personality leading to this end does not correspond to their final actions in conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the assumption that the Rob Lowe character on Christmas Eve - literally in ninety seconds of "No, I've cheated you" - was made clear, and Rob Lowe's character is not upset about it! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me," and he is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me that I was about to die then he said "No, sorry, I just fooled you," I'll raise some hell. I do not feel bad about giving up the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you from watching. Please save yourself and do not watch this movie.
