Anyone who is a jazz bassist in the 1920s, a 1920s dresser, Charleston, and superhero yachts (for example, in all cases) would like to admire this film. But the sad truth is that this is all there is to it. The plot is plain and clear, as the acting is often either horrific or playing on the comic side of the events, and when it does not end up the whole thing, there is an impression about the mirrors and the smoke. This is a nice-made bad movie.
