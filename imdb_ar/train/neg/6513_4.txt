I'd rather have 20 radical channels instead of reviewing this film again. An annoying prince, Miles Berkowitz, has wasted almost two hours of my life with this fake annoying piece. The only fun thing about this whole mess is the abhorrent camera cracking of Mr. Samaha on her breasts and ass. Berkowitz takes a wonderful concept and grinds it in the dust. It is intermittent and poorly executed, in a clear attempt to make it appear passive or funny. it's not like that. I rarely feel that the film was a waste of film (or tape), but this film is eligible for this distinction. If there is a history that indicates seeing this movie, Dawn.
