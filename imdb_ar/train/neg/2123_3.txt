I go to UCSB and have some lessons with executive producer Allison Anders. She is a wonderful teacher and director, so I thought that anything you put on her name should be good. This film looked like a choice at the Santa Barbara Film Festival as a good choice. <br /> <br /> While this film included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and consistency was far from anything he tried. To accomplish. My main problem is that this movie was the first movie of someone and can tell him clearly. Bad behavior and worst scenario prevent this film from moving away from Earth. The soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggling to overcome the grief that was leaving him and now returning to where he grew up. I would just say that despite some of the best movie craft, the lack of story and performance really prevented them from being good.
