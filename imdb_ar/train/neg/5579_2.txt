The 1960s is an entertaining movie at times, and most of this entertainment is a laugh at the film. It is very uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for example the switch between black, white and color. If done correctly, this may be fairly effective, but because it has been done badly, it has become a nuisance and has not detracted from bad experience already; It was not too bad for a TV click, but again it was awkward at other times. Many events have not been coherent, and the confusion is over. How did this family somehow end up attending many major events during the 1960s? The end was very happy for my tails; because it was Hollywood, everything was finally turned to the right. I advise you not to waste your time in the sixties and do something else with your time. I'm glad I saw this in class, not in my time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan music. These are just my wandering thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, stay away from this.
