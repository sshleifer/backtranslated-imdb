Summary: The moon is complete. A creature, a huge waswolf, is on the hunt. Not for meat, not for blood (it does not seem to occur to you to bite in the way), but for a mate. Is in search of a girl. Not any girl though. the girl. The pure girl (as well as the werewolf, although she does not know it yet). Three, well check that two policemen (after the first scene) and the old despicable lady are all they can stop, or even know that the thing that kills and eat a lot of people about the full moon is a wolf. This strong strong wolf, Darkwolf, closes the girl. If he gets it, the fate of mankind. Now the police have to find the girl, convince her not only that there is a wolf, yet, he wants to rape her, maybe kill her, but she is a wolf herself. Then they stopped him. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, boys and teenagers. Lots of scenes with semi-naked girls are more or less important to the plot. Mostly less. Well, I think you need something to fill some time because the chart (expected) is thin. Unfortunately there are few girls to help this plot of collapse. One usually turns into two main themes. nudity. Check. Then special effects. Well ... well, there are some things you might call effects. It's not very special though. In fact, to be frank, they are very bad. The film seems to be in short supply. They could not afford the clothes for some girls;), the effects are cheap. Some transitions between the wasp and the human form, obviously they are done by the computer, are very bad. You may overlook such things. But Darkwolf itself is very difficult and will not see any killings. Only some mutilated bodies after that. There is a bit of amazing blood, in which the film must be drowned in the blood frankly. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and personalities. They often do well, but unfortunately there have been flaws while the characters (or actors) lose them. A few of these loopholes can be related to the above problems. Such as bad effects, or poor budget (?). This can be explained by the fact that the shooting is a little expensive, even if the figures are armed like a small army and the target was in sight (not moving). But hey, when you are in real danger, there is nothing that will save your life like a liner ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this can not be explained for moments when Cop, Steve, is the only one who He knows how to deal with the problem, the wolf who is, escapes, when the only things he can be sure of are that the wolf will come to the girl, who is beside him now only, and that he can not let her be. But it certainly allowed developers to extend the finish a little more ... <br /> <br /> But I do not mind seeing any of the leading actresses / actresses get another experience in another film. <br /> Well. To give a simple conclusion: not a film recommended. <br /> <br /> 3/10
