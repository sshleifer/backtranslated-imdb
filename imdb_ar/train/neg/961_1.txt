Silly, simple and short, crazy (Volume 1: Woman from nowhere else) does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short story (just over sixty minutes) is not inspired by the traditional Western spaghetti. It is a piece of The Rame & the Dead (Sam Reemi (a tribute recognized to Westerners) who were brought to a contemporary place In the film QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge on Sherif Sharif (played by Jane Hackman) who put her father's fate (a short veil written by Gary Senis) in her hands and shot him in the wrong.In the CRAZY GUN, Which played its role in Ryuko Unikura) to the revenge of the treacherous Mr. Tojo (who played Shingo Tsurumi at the minimum), who put the fate of her father in her hands; The only big difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo paralyzes sake with sake ?? Well, I will not spoil it for you if you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a car shop and bar next to a US military base, so I think this is enough for his town ?? damaged by Togo, a local criminal with a high price Ridiculed on his head for reasons he did not explain or explore. Saki recognizes her true self as a favored hunter, and confronts local militants in a shootout whose design prevents more than a transient resemblance to the works of Johnny Toe and John Woo.

All its enemies are defeated by a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where to get the rocket launcher. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is medium for a DVD version. There is a granular quality for many sequences, but, in general, this is not a bad quoting. Leave sound quality a bit of a fantasy at times, but, again, this is not a bad quote. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie.
