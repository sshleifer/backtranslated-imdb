What calls the film "House of the Dead" as the worst film of all time is that it is not. There are worse movies out there. I watch a lot of ninja movies in Hong Kong which are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese drama drama, and footage of the ninja was finally included to create something that could technically be called a "movie". <br /> <br /> House of the Dead is one of the worst movies I have seen in theaters. While walking halfway, I actually felt I was somewhat stupid because of my position during 45 minutes of this litter.
