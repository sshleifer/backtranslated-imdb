There are movies like "Plan 9" too bad and they have their magic. There are films like "Waterworld" that have the same lot that can not be interpreted as a car accident. There are movies like "Desperate Living" that you hate. Cowboys do not have any of these refunds. The cast has enough talent to make almost any piece of viewable, and from what I was told, the book is fun. <br /> <br /> How can this film be so bad? First of all, it seems that the director has collected a collection of names without any link other than what will be achieved in the twenties. Then tell them to do the best Kevin Costner tradition. Open the book at random and start filming everything on the page, making sure that the vast areas of America are not being fun in any way. Finally give the editing job to your horse, because the meat packing plant put it in place. He has twenty years experience in cutting. <br /> <br /> This movie now sets the basement for me. It's very bad, it's not good because it's bad.
