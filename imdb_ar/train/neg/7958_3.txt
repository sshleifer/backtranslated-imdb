Protégé works in a linear fashion. Do not expect any fast-paced action, and you will not find yourself panting because you simply do not have sitting moments on the edge. <br /> <br /> There are not many basic things, so do not expect one too. I would not be wrong in acting - the show would have been much worse if I had not been representing Wu who was the only movie grace saved. And what a nice little girl, too. <br /> <br /> The humor at best is weak, and the show must disappear as a drug campaign. The usual shock tactic (esp in scenes with Zhang) is used to tell us the things we already know - drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, Not easy to stop, will fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may seem a bit harsh, but I feel the presentation is far from smooth and somewhat incomplete [SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was brought to the police station: What "We've just had all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997, and that's what caught it." No, no car chase, just a jump in the scene, which undermined Wu's role as a secret cover in the first place. To the fact that it was produced by Mediacorp Raintree - a Singapore film production company.
