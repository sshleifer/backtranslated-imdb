I was given 1 for this film. I can not understand how Ituri Scola, one of the biggest directors of Italian cinema, made a film like that, stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are baseless, boring and not interesting. Very long, very boring. The only things I keep in this film are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Jassman. We hope that Scola will dramatically change themes and style in his next film.
