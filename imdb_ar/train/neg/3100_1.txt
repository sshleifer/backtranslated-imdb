Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> Manos - Destiny of Destiny and Future War gives an opportunity for their money like the worst film ever produced. This is fun to laugh, as Manos was painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as an ideal film to describe the term: "80's cheeze". Representation (I use the term loosely) Horribly, Hobgoblins are some of the worst dolls you'll ever see, and the conflict of the garden tool must be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect tool for MST3K, and this version is the only way to watch this mess. Mike and Robots give a lot of ammunition to pull out some of the planes they've ever made. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots ..... Allah helps you !!
