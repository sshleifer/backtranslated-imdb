I agree with most fans in Colombo that this film was an unnecessary change of coordination. Colombo is a unique policeman with unconventional police methods. This film looks like a new version of any normal detective drama of the past. This is the disturbing point, because Colombo is not a normal investigator. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this film that left me curious. First, I can not figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Perhaps the best title is "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Second, Colombo hides a piece of evidence without providing a reason (at least for viewers) why he did so. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just frustrate me. I am glad that Peter Falc returned to the usual Colombo. <br /> <br />
