I've watched this movie a while ago (while working on a trailer for a film production company) and had a TERRIBLE movie. Hewitt is modest at best, Hopkins performs his performance in (but still explodes Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec seems bored. Trust me in this: You should avoid this movie like a plague if it is launched. It seems to last forever as the plot unfolds as tired as a snail. It's unbearable, the cinema is crazy and the pedestrian trend. Alec Baldwin should go to the cinema school if he plans to take it out again. As for his behavior, his personality is totally undesirable, making it impossible to root. Dan Ackroyd is very funny and the amazing composition of the jury near the end of the film is nice, but this movie is absolutely awesome.
