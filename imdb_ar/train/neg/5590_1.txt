Horrible movie. About an old cortical painter lounging with a little girl. boring. Tatum O Neil advances the suggestions on its side and has some of the best lines in the film's history. Richard Burton seems to be about to die in this film, and we're supposed to think he looks "good for sixty". Representation is bad, as is the plot. The characters are terrifying, as is the story. It's really hard to feel anyone in this film, except for Larry Owashin, who plays the role of a young man in a porn theater hitting Tatum. It's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you love Tatum, like me - that's why I hired it in the first place - please do not see this movie. It's really bad, and you'll wonder if PAPER MOON might have been a coincidence. Not so, because BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS, it is known that they can behave well, but still, do not rent this film. And if you love Burton, he hired something when it looked good, not a dig.
