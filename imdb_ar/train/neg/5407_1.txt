If you would like to watch a real quality movie, get the Eden Formula. This wonderful movie should cost $ 50. It contains thin text of the chip, patheticly bad sets, lighting and camera work, the stop motion, the stuffed paper monster, which is quite laughable (it sometimes seems to use a man in a rubber suit and / or a monster glove doll - Both horrifying). <br /> <br /> All actors speak of their lines as if they had never seen them before and read from a distance. Special effects are the way behind the lousy. The only sad thing is that they dropped the truly elegant original title "Tyranasaurus Wrecks" which sums up exactly what you get for a full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you get rid of the bottom of the barrel so hard you have to break into the rough that falls under. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
