I watched the whole film until the shameful end, even though I felt very angry at what I saw. I felt that the director was screaming for attention, and the only way he could achieve this was to be as excited as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I loved this country, but this film portrays British youth as the worst imaginable way. There is nothing to say but avoid, it will make you angry and sick. The persons concerned should be ashamed.
