Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) being investigated for possible involvement in the loss of money. When a bank is robbed and hostages taken against their will by the mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is hired to coerce the thief to surrender? One shot him to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a strong woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions, and sent to retrieve the item from the safe deposit box to the owner of the bank that is stored inside the bank, and you have a triple dilemma. Unfortunately, all you get is the movie setting, and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at its best in an ineffective and daring performance. The only saving grace for the film is the starring co-stars Judy Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most surprising performance and sophistication that plays against the genre as an unrivaled villain. Clive Owen does not give much to do besides hugging and appearing, but the depth of his presence and his ability to represent more than compensate for his backward role. It is strange that a lot of talent in this film is lost of little influence or interest. You have to wonder what the director Spike Lee was thinking during the creation of this film. The most puzzling aspect of a man's interior, however, is the amount of unjustified praise he received. For the film, which seems to contain all its pre-summer films, this film looks horribly flat.
