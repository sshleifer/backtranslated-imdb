I did not publish a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is very bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it was by trying to think of it as a gift or a parody. But it is not. It's really un-consciously self-bad. This is a serious attempt to flounder with glory. Other reviewers have pointed to the many drawbacks of the film, so I will try not to repeat it, but I urge you to see this film. Throughout that, I was either unable to speak, literally shaking myself with disbelief, or rolling on the ground in a hysterical state. I have not had much fun watching a movie for years. In fact, I will try to convince all my friends to see it because it is the kind of film that should be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur tests the tests - a boy (his incredible dance) - unjustified nudity (the director / lead actor only had to get a naked image) - the office of the cartoonist and painting of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what is the narrative function played by this game?!?) - the former wife's match with Ben for her weapon - the detailed sequence in which Arthur the preacher was killed; Incredibly - yes, the religious-minded, fanatical brother with his ovary hair and WeHo fashion - and my favorite favorite, And Blaine "The Entertainer" as an editorial and "Pachebel's Canon in the Grand D" as the sound of the closing! - The menu goes on - you should see !!!
