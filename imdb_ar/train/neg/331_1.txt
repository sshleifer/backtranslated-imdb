I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, a comedian who works on a cruise ship. This is the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! There's nothing else in the film that makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy man's breakfast, not in a stupid, idiotic way, but in a more frustrating way, "throw the shoes in the way of" TV. "Even General Noriega appears, for no reason I can understand. It was certainly not for humor.) Add to this mix Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent, I've heard of before, and you have something I would never call the worst movie ever, because going abroad does not fit the basic definition of the film. I am sure that this is the first movie you will ever say A bad movie will be "at least not as bad as Going Overboard."
