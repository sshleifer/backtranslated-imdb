Well first of all, suck this movie. But let's examine why. The assumption that the machine is capable of converting matter into energy, storing it, then moving it and reassembling it is the least interesting. But this is as much as they take this premise. Instead of going into what can happen if someone does that kind of machine, they break the dreaded thing. This can be a good hypothesis. Coexistence with the responsibility of this kind of power, dealing with continuous temptation, ie .. hidden man. But no ... they break the dreaded thing. Lembach wants to leave. So the doctor is forging things back together, trying to move himself. Just to make it his beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh). Unless he had decided to leave. He is now wandering around the countryside killing people because his small experience has failed and will not give him money. Wah. Then to make the film worse, throw a dry British relationship between the semi-qualified professors assigned to help him. Between their love sessions, they made two frivolous attempts to find him while half of London were killed. All this could have been avoided by not breaking the damn machine, which would not have happened had he not left Limbach. Try this movie so I gave it two hard stars for effort, but it would have been better if they had not broken the damn machine, which made Lembach leave, making him try again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
