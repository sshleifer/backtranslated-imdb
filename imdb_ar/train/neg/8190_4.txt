My Take: The Christmas comedy formula is tired. Laughing tired seems to be the underlying talent as well. <br /> <br /> I like holidays like the next guy (even if I often have a bad state of blues blues), but it just seems like a dumped land for a bunch of comedy movies that would be bad films in any Day of the year, but this does not make it less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * swallows * still counting), who wants to watch a movie about his brother? In a piece of land that will be at home with the Disney franchise SANTA CLAUSE (with the exception of the occasional humor and "Little" Helper from Santa wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is the introduction of a 116-minute joke. Sure, Julie's first 'St. Nick has a brother, but where does he go?' <br /> <br /> It's really a disgrace. FRED CLAUS has actors who may have made it a fun Christmas-time comedy that is likely to melt with snow, but it was much better. Vince Vaughn is your usual imitator, but we believe that he is really the long-lost brother of Santa Gomez, who is not old, and who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is hesitant, and worse, the efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) is watching father's father's day, which is close to closure. Haha! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Cathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa Hilper Charlene, and John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Fis plays a unique girlfriend! I do not know whether you have praised the casting process or put it down. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they have been given very little work. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best FRED CLAUS can reach is Santa's brother being the exact opposite and some joke about DJ Elf. I have to admit that I have received some laughs involving a unique presence of the advisory group of celebrity brothers (joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but laughter begins and ends there. Worse still, the film surrenders to feelings that are supposed to make us "happy" and teach us a lesson about "the meaning of Christmas really." Apparently, what Christmas means for Hollywood is to get as much money as possible in Christmas shopping remaining. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
