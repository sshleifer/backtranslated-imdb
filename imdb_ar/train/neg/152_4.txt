You can consider that some facts in the debate are corrupt. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor and other nominations ... I do not know about them, but it would be difficult to justify them, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this is very intriguing, so intervene. While watching this film, there was an interstitial distinction during the film "Course in Art", which screamed at me: "Emotions are an honest emotion that has been faithfully presented." The feelings are sugary and unreal, the wrong view of life. This is the highest passion. When two people in real life begin to read aloud in sync, as does Sealy and Shoug Avery when they sit on the bed, walk the messages of my intention that they have found? There are examples of this kind of fake behavior throughout the film: all the men who were walking around Miss Millie's car and then standing in unison like a herd of birds taking off when you go by car; Harpo falls through the roofs of the various buildings he works on (cheap slap) ; A whole group of revelers heading out from Jook Joint collectively to the small church, as if magically entwined by chorus singing ... nothing rings true. I even wondered if the name of Harpo was deliberately chosen because he named his wife Sophia the real, "Opera", backwards. Spielberg is no higher than "gravity". <br /> <br /> It is not that Spielberg is unable to act and passion is faithfully provided. Schindler's list was amazing, touching me deeply, and I am very impressed with the fact that Private Ryan is also keeping its reality, even if the story is a bit contrived.
