The film Yi Le Purple Butterfly Battles a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese troops in the war-torn Shanghai. Deng Hui (Zhang Zhi) and her former lover Hideko Itami (Toro Nakamura) find themselves on both sides of the conflict after a chance encounter. <br /> <br /> I agree with the references from Paris. The film replaces a half-historical dispute, consisting of a conspiracy, without giving the public one reason to care about characters or their causes. It does not help to change the sudden time of things because it seems completely unjustified and meaningless. I do not mind dark movies, but the lack of light, the shaky camera shots, and the generally poor filmmaking make this film a difficult film to watch and stay interested. From Georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and cinematography afraid", but I do not think this helps the film. The background of the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not think you can achieve this by any justice by editing it as if it were a film by Michael Bay. Excessive melodramatic moments do not add to its hydropower. <br /> <br /> All actors are appropriately saddened. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting group where she spends the entire film doing what she seems to do best in all her movies, brood and look generally uncomfortable. However, they at least add some variety to this role through long chains and participate in the worst love-making scene since Michael Bean and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. See how the manager comes from Suzhou He. 10/02
