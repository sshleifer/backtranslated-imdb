I have seen this film twice before, and I do not seem to understand why the makers of this pile made nonsense. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression on Hitler's environment, the way they brought back the production of Austria in the late 1890s, World War I and the war. What I do not understand is why they portrayed Hitler as a 100% pure evil, insane, unreliable, mentally unstable. He was, after all, a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man with a dark side of course, no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven does he picture it this way? All its positive aspects were excluded from the scenario, leaving only a propaganda image of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization at all. Yes, Germany threw into the devastating Second World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes he was sometimes particularly unstable especially at the end of the war. Completely true. But, again, why the hell did they lie to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I never think this movie was a warning. The real danger to Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to rise to power in moments of global weakness. The fact that this evil was largely recognized and yet embraced by almost all Germans alive (not to mention the Austrians and many other people) makes this a warning to modern civilization, not the fact that Hitler was like "eccentric". If it were as if the industrialists made us believe - I was convinced that the German people were lagging behind. A man like this person in this film did not have to go anywhere near the party leader - let alone the ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
