I feel angry at Shakespeare's recent alterations when the director can not think of using or updating the original. If native words are used in an updated setting, it will be particularly difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st century, although it can work well in period styles, for example the late Victorian Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night collection. It can work with a 30 setting if there is much less song and dance than Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it ends up being a very trivial show though it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Pranag himself. I agree that he is very far from playing a student, but more importantly, he is a seasoned Shakespearean actor. Despite all his efforts to be just another student, his power of acting appears all the time. Of course the king should have played - no problem having a mature student King surrounded by young students. Instead, we had an interesting but undefeated representative of the king, and therefore he was a king not known as the king without royal attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of songs and dance, found to be boring, despite nice songs and gentle enough dancing, unfortunately means that Shakespeare's great dialogue had to be greatly reduced. So it ended up being a trivial and mild solution, and I felt very bored, including comic twists, and I was happy when it was over. Branagh did not add Shakespeare's justice to this production. <br /> <br /> However, Richard Breyers and Geraldine McEwan are honored, as wonderful as an older couple.
