I will give the writer / director William Goff credit for finding someone who finances this wrong "excitement". A good argument for not wasting money is signing up for HBO, let alone buying DVDs based on the art of mystery and damage. One pedestrian Dennis Hopper and the game of Richard Jericho do not add anything important to their resumption, although the direction of art is not bad. The dialogue will leave you full of wonder when it appears; this is the storytelling at its worst. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no sympathy, no vent, nothing. There are a few female attractors who often get bored until boredom fills up, but this is definitely a film seen as a trailer. I feel sorry for the man who threw the green light on this thing. Suitable for late night viewing only. You have been warned.
