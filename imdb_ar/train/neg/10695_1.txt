Well I've read about this movie somewhere on the Internet, and many have criticized how bad this film is and suck it. I did not agree more. Then after watching this movie on DVD, I was thinking twice about it and then I became a commercial for this movie on TV. Fortunately, I did not spare my money for this nonsense. I died from my sleep for this film and soon it turned out that this film could not make me feel good so I can not judge how the film was made, but anyway ... still sucking. For those who loved this movie, I apologize for the ignition of this film and tell him how much the film is absorbing. I do not know what you think of this film?
