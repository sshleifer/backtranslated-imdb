After watching this film, I felt the urgent need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a wonderful actress and a wonderful now Max Beasley charming in the film "Kill me later." The story, although it is not original, only showed some promise. None of that was important ... at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has almost no talent as a manager. The shots were slowed down, the shots were taken, the footage was reversed, the camera angles were used, the noise filters were used, Zellion quickly snapped, jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it with a disturbing "modern" soundtrack of explosive trash. I can not remember the last time I saw an incompetent job directing a movie. Her arrogance must be huge to get out the acting and the story and put its direction in the foreground and the middle so that members of the audience can notice it. They are crammed under their throats. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the film "Kill Me Later" that shows what it can be and what it should have been. Unfortunately, when things begin to show promise, Ms. Lustig dug into her bag of school tricks and movies and mingled things again. It's shameful because Blair and Bislly had good chemistry and you can say that the film had a really good heart. 10/03
