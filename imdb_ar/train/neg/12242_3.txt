I was expecting a bad film, and I got a bad movie. But I did not really imagine the worst fantasy of how bad the film was. I do not even want to try to explain the subject of Blood Surf. Not about blood browsing, but a big crocodile. They complain of the false shark in the jaw, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark to the end. Here the crocodile is shown several times, the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good mooring, you can see Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker had the opportunity to make a movie to surf the sharks, but was forced to produce a movie that was unlucky. He had a chance to make an original film, but he wanted to make a beast film. If you understand how bad this film is, does it have some good parts? Not really, I've got some nudity and a sexual scene that is taken directly from a playboy movie. Acting is not half bad, Kate Fisher looks good. Too bad they do not take her top off. The main actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The location is lovely and the film starts well with some nice surfing sights. The writer and director are not to blame for being gifted. The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen, the script is really badly written, and the director has no talent at all, and not much imagination either. <br /> <br /> You do not see this. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fisher. Not worth it. Watch the siren to see Kate naked, and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodiles. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Because I'm in a good mood, Maureen and Razabal look pretty nude, Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress), and Dix Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlingi did a good job with a piece of paper they had to work with.
