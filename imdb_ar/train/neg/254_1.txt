Ah, house. How I hate you let me count the ways. 1. Try to be funny, but are tacky and unattractive. Every joke is predictable and predictable, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to throw. 2. Trying to be dramatic, but you do not believe; the woman is terribly overpriced, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, which is very scary ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun.) Does not work, does not he? Lawyer, maybe, but not a gun ... does not fit.) As for Jimmy Fox, well, just watching him try to create a dramatic dialogue and heart is ridiculous , And makes me want to throw. 3. Trying to be packed with procedures, but instead be boring and tedious several times. When the temperature rises, the tri-camera holder must be lost, because the viewer is more wobbly than the Witch Project, and I find myself angry, and I want to throw it again. 4. Trying to be a good film, but you failed, it failed, it failed! I prefer to walk barefoot across the desert with a pack full of jerky hay and no water, no sun visor, and only Merrill Streep's company. This hell will be more than a minute spent watching everyone in Bait make her way through a stupidly written story with Bill Gates about a bad guy, let's not even talk about the huge bomb that explodes in Jimmy Fox's car We've just stopped CLIFF, but in a way I could not escape ... Just kill me now, do the right thing and promise me that somehow I will not have to watch a movie that bad again.
