The film, a global version of Protelco-MLC, is a tedious novel of the theory of smashing the molecular structure of a body, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy" and then resubmitting it completely to the "target zone." There is no explanation as to why this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by Hidden Actress Bryant Hallide, "Deville Doll") believes it is something he devotes, and his aides, Pat Hill (Mary Beach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) <br /> <br /> During an experiment before the famous Dutch scientist "Limbach" (Gordon Heinz), his machines failed because of the sabotage, so "Sheila" (Tracy Crisp) sabotaged himself to "search" for revenge. Of course, it disintegrates and looks like "roast pork" with the ability to dumb people. <br /> <br /> Through this new force, he can exploit some of the stupid cousins, a security man named Latham (Derek de Marne) and the head of his laboratory, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black jacket as well. <br /> <br /> In the end, although Hill and Mitchell try to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. On the whole, the film is useless with no message at all. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most frustrating color films you will ever see.
