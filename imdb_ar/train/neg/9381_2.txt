Mona lives on the margins of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I've seen this because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I've missed something. Mona's personality is characterized by little or no character as she drifts into life being rude to people, becoming tall and contributing nothing to anyone's life. It's not interesting or exciting. It's useless. <br /> <br /> I've seen and known enough people like this: there's no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I do not want Mona anywhere near me, they tend to steal anything unkempt and leave her friends in trouble. It is certainly ambiguous - because there is nothing to it. Lots of junkies, winos and bums that I've seen are mysterious; I do not want to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is something I missed completely. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews from people assume that anything done by a French director is a fine art.
