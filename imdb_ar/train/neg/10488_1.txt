Elvis has left the building and is lucky because he did not have to watch this stinking stink. Scene after the director of the scene Joel Zwick finds ways to make a script less funny. Filled with uncommon death, vulgar gay characters, and penetration jokes, this film is more desperate than entertaining. This is the kind of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger will follow Doris Day to early retirement. Let's remember it the way it was (talent) and not what it became. David Leisure, and Dennis Richards are tasty, and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to reduce their talents at every turn. It seems that the man who plays Elvis looks more like a gomer than a king. The only really good thing to choose is the little girl who plays Basinger as an excuse. She really looks like her and she is actually very good. The only other reason to watch this movie at all is to look for Tom Hanks etching. Veil is not all that funny, but at least not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has pictures that criminalize Hanks or anything that makes him do this movie.
