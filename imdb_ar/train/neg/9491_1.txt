This film makes you truly appreciate the invention of a fast forward button on the remote control. It's a wonderful boredom in beautiful pictures. One-time Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus footage. However, what I found in the film is difficult is that although Anja Shot was almost 19 years old, she was portrayed as younger than she actually was. This is a whole lolita thing especially since there is an older man involved leaving me somewhat unstable. The heroine was actually shaved in the pubic area to make her look younger than she was. Come on, sex is a beautiful time among adult adults. The other thing I find strange is that neither Burt nor Shoot has a nude scene in the film, well, and not a suitable scene at least.
