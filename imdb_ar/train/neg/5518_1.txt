I have not seen this, and I do not plan to watch this movie or any other film that includes Lindsay ...... unless a "poor little rich girl" adjusts her life for two years beginning with the most recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone went to see any of Lindsay's recent films. I imagine that 2007 will be a high watermark in her career in filmmaking, so she can clean her act. All modern advertising has only hampered her filmmaking career, if she has any other aspirations to produce any other films. <br /> <br /> Up to this time, filmmakers have actively sought Lindsay to get roles in the next production. Now, Lindsay may have to go to the tests and actually compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "toxic" and may have a negative impact on ticket sales at any box office. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... Now Lindsay will have to deal with him "do not want to be" ..... will you be able to handle this? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno wants to return Lindsay to his television show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my opinion. I have no inside information.
