It was not only annoying to listen to him, but he did not have any jokes. I swear that some of the well-groomed Asian men who tell Uma Mama that they were more fun than Lyra's nonsense. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary claimed he stopped drug use during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he still had something; Mostly inaccurate related to drugs. One of his jokes was something like: "I will not use the crack, especially since I have the same name between my ass" - man, how did he get to that? I swear that the only guy who needs to close f ** k is Dennis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him alive. This man is completely absorbed. <br /> <br /> If you easily enjoy insults and "jokes" where you can get out yourself, waste your time with this junk.
