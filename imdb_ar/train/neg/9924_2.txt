The Dutchman Schultz, AKA Arthur Flenheimer, was a real person and his life was fairly poorly documented. The film, which he claims to be portraying his life, was supposed to be used as a fictional character, because excessive events represent a great departure from facts and chronology. Not only that, but it ignores some interesting details that include other versions such as the failure of public relations in the north of the country and its conversion to religion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano and Lansky et al. Allah. But this is as far as it goes. The scene of Luciano's explosive panel carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg at his home, with the help of his mother, is ridiculous. Also, there is a scene in which the Dutch approach his mother to give protection to Legs Diamond. It just does not work. Ms. Fleggenheimer's personality does not work either. This film does not need a Jewish mother to fall down to ease the comic. The lame representation of the diamond legs was humorous enough. I'm sure the man is turning around in his grave. By the way, the Dutch actually killed people, but it was not Rambo or 007. The scene where he spent the brewery was ridiculous. I do not know, I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I did not get it.
