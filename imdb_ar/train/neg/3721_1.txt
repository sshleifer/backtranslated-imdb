They are useful to scare people into God, and this is the "horizon of the event." One has an important and moving message, the other is a one-dimensional as a religious movie can be obtained. Too bad, Paul Anderson went to the evil Resident Evil movies, and he really had something going on. <br /> <br /> Thief in the Night hinders many of the features of clear independent films (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion). It is clear what the film's intentions are from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with the Omega Code, and went behind them, and other films of ordeal. Their main ingredient is that they are very interested in selling their message: "Save, people!" That everything else becomes second in hitting the public with the Bible. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe I even write much about an ineffective film. Completely skip and return to Sam Neil waving an analogy. 1 of 5.
