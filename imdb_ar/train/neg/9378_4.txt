This is another production of Northeast Florida, filmed mainly in and near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Ranch. I was rather surprised that the company was able to seize the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to achieve street scenes. The movie is beautiful and very bad. Tammy Irene cute, but exaggeration. Elaine Brennan acts more than that. Good for young children, or for those who love fluff in large doses. A 4 by Miller-Movies.
