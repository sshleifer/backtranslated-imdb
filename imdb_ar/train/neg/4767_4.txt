I watched this movie as I liked the plot, where a group of strangers were detained prisoners trying to figure out how they were connected. <br /> <br /> The setting was clearly influenced by the first (and better) film. Although there was not much movement, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of comedian satisfaction in the form of two male "male alpha" and was a welcome surprise (on me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart has not given up acting yet. <br /> <br /> Some things fail me personally; 1. Children were sexually identified in such a way that they would turn everything from children to bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. The biography of MJH about her former policeman "put her in this" when he was actually the least worthy person to be there, did not contribute correctly to the events that preceded their arrest. <br /> <br /> 3. The end ..... What kind of films ends in the middle of something that happens? There was no decision, no shelf connection, no clear end ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> For this reason, two stars were dropped from my classification. The first 2 points I would slide but not the end!
