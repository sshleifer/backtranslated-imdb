The only reason I comment is that I finally told the reason why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we all realized that at the same time this week, Dr. Cox was bald because he showed these episodes in a different order than the ones they filmed. The last episode when our favorite nurse died angry and nurse Jesus loving Dr. Cox. They must have shown them out of order for some strange reason and forgotten that they had continued in continuity. For shame, let. I've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliott tried to set Scott Foley's date and her hair wet before the water hit her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite program needs to be increased.
