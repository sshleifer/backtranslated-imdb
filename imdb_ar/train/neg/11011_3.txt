A series of painful, ugly plays that seem to last forever and one day. This is not as shocking and shocking as "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but this is by no means authentic, in any sense or form. Featuring the worst rhyme clown ever. Any more if it is not offensive to anyone but the most cautious or politically correct. It also contains the worst parody of the EVER song that was shown on the film, WORST Arnold Impersonation EVER (not just the worst movie ever shown, literally WORST EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, or Michelle Clark Duncan, or Slash, appeared in this (the reasons I saw in the first place). The only thing that was mildly amusing was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but people who are doing their job in life to get this down at 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something prominent with you live people. In addition, if true, the Church of Scientology dislikes it, it can not be bad. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
