We all know what the situation is when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, Neil Simon's comedy looks something like when you have the worst of all days trying to reach the office. Sometimes, not worth it, I know what I mean? Sometimes, it is worth doing something when it was already done, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and the best too. <br /> <br /> It is not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong actor for the role as an advert harry and confirmed. Quite the opposite, of both cases. Not that Goldie Hawn is also incompetent; her work has always been good, if not good, since I first saw her on television and Rowan and Martin laugh in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it is not about the desperate couple. At all: it is a fact about New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives away in the married bliss ?? Somewhat ?? In the greatest city in the world. This is if you are a New Yorker resident ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 film is still an excellent comedy that has literally explored all the things that could be wrong when you make a trip somewhere, and included most of the positions and views that You can imagine about what could happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off in unjustified shades specifically for an audience these days that you expect or want to see excess. For example, the brilliant appeal of the main players is not satisfactory. There is also a veil (also relatively long) from Rudy Giuliani, the then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Giuliani disagreed with the president until then? Worst ?? Announcement speaks of the gentle face of New York. <br /> <br /> So we have John Cleese, and he is remodeling his role as Basil Foley? But this time, as prancing across the dresser also? Again, the hotel staff squeezes them, sucking up the rich clients and making themselves look like the fool in this role. In the meantime, the Fulty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, have been badly damaged. <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was a city that was dying in many ways. He was almost bankrupt almost literally. So, when I was made in 1970, that city I saw was dark, dark, moody, disturbing, not the place that the newly-married couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke (as it was then, polluted and all). By 1999, things had improved: the facade was back, New York was booming, and the Big Apple was ready for you to bitten, if you had the moxie ... So, of course, he finds The couple at the second coming that Moshi inside them and finally join the battle to continue the wonderful American dream of life and freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Thus, this film is really playful but not for reasons perhaps conceived by producers. As much as Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn liked comedy, this film is a much better picture than that made with Jack Lemmon. If you have seen the latter, surely do not care about this.
