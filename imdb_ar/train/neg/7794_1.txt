This movie is God awful. Not one quality for this film. Do you think that injustice will be good but bad? The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it "acting" is the worst I have ever seen. It is clear that this film was filmed on a video camera and runs on a budget of about $ 500 most likely. If you want to watch the movie Zombie well from watching Dawn of the dead or Day of dead. If you want to watch a good good shot on the zombie video movie like this but in a better way than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at any price. It is not applicable and tampering. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid film.
