I've seen this movie many times, and all I can say is that this is a low-budget trash that has nothing to do with real historical facts. The performance of actors is very poor but it is the result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who has seen this movie now might think of Hitler as a crazy crazy madman running with a gun like some gangsters in Chicago. I can only say that there are far better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that the "rise of evil" is far below average. I can recommend the German film "The Fall", in which you can see the wonderful performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganes on Adolf Hitler's list.
