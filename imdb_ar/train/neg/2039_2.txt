This movie was almost unbearable to sit down. I can go beyond the fact that he seems to have been filmed with a home video camera and that the film is supposed to run for weeks, but the characters have not changed their clothes once, but the representation has broken the fourth wall into pieces for me. I saw acting better in a play from the fourth grade. Apart from that the plot is unrealistic. If the man is suspected that the man would give him. I was very disappointed that all the killings had been done with what kind of juggling weapon. This is not a traditional version that was not killed by Zodiac using only a gun the authorities would know it was not. The other thing that really bothered me was that they called it DSM 4 when it was the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. In general, I think this film is not the type of film that can be done with a low budget, at least not as low as them or they can make sure they have better or more attractive actors. Many people have gone to the low-budget path without having to use the awesome actors in Easy Rider, who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
