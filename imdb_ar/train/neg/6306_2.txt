While working at a video store, I see a few movies and sometimes try to watch some big movies. Happened proud to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​the story of a ship with a predominantly black crew during the Second World War was of some merit. But in less than 10 minutes of watching the film, you discover that the main point of the film is the knowledge of racial tension in World War II. The basic story revolves around the ship and the crew and their exploits in the war. This basic point is stamped on you to the extent of over-over the film. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their victory in the face of the trials and tribulations they suffered. The film was supposed to focus on the achievements of these men for themselves, the Navy and their country and not to produce a film focused on racism during World War II.
