It's hard to believe that people like this! I think children can enjoy it, but for me this kind of young children's movies can not afford it. The plot is predictable, Belushi boring, probably the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director some responsibility for the child, but it was very painful to see him. I feel embarrassed about her now, after people knew she was. When I sang Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound - and then I came here and discovered that they did it because they won Star Search. I have always felt that Jim Bluche should be ashamed of trading on behalf of his wonderfully lost brother, and this crap shows why. Stars zero.
