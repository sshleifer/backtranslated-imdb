I have not seen anyone applaud this film yet and I think I may be the first. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. In fact I did not see the end of it. It was like watching a really dull or really good soap (all the nonsense soap). The actors were poor and the story was bad. The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what it is about. The script was awful. 2 people in an angry conversation together have been threatening, expecting a good guy to say something really good and won on nonsense but not. "If I do it ... I'll hurt you," he says. If comedy is your thing, be careful. Please do not watch this movie because ... it's bad !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Weak representation, bad battles, bad scenario. <br /> <br /> You do not see! Of course this is in my opinion.
