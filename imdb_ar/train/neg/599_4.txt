Well, I must say this before revealing the "monster". Saying that he really did not fall into this category, but just something strange had an annoying scream! I personally think that Grandma has escaped this thing, but anyway. I was actually making access to this film, although the main character drunk and addicted heroine did not act as a call. But such scenes when they were running away from the train, you can see that the figure at the door was crawling, where the guard just killed and put "monster" his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then, the catastrophe was formed at the moment when the beast was revealed and became just an average horror, with a limited amount of excitement or fear. I slowly became more bored and wanted to turn off the thing. I like that most people said it was rooted for the homeless, especially the guy, he gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this film could have been something special instead, it has become what all the horror has become these days! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for cheap panic here and there, or the reckless Gore Festival (which is limited, virtually nonexistent), everything you give it goes, but what all the serious fear watchers see in place Another, there are much better movies.
