I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" Attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now is just silly. Clich√© movie message. The circle of vision is confusing. And this terrible song in the end grate. I really wish to install the seats. After a lot of walking, all you want to do is sit for a few minutes. When you hear a movie there to see it looks very charming! You never get while sitting, do you? Error! I was standing there for 18+ minutes leaning on a short railing. Disney must make the latest Maelstrom game like an attraction to revive objects and replace this dull little movie. Not funny. skip it. In fact, skip Canada completely unless you eat there. Go directly to the UK.
