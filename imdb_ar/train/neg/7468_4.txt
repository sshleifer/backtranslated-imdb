Maybe the only thing that made the film up to four for me was the fact that I loved Peter Falk. One of the world's greatest images of incompetence stutter. . . Yet it is one of the only anchors that prevent this from being an anarchic disaster. As POP Romano, he provides a respectable mix of gangster charms and a straight man to the craziness of Chris Kattan Mania. Richard Round Tree also offers respectable performances as a skilled chief and a fianc√©e Shaw as a talented FBI agent wearing her head from the glass ceiling and Fred Ward as a consultant for Falk and Benedict Arnold. He has some wonderful possibilities, and in the hands of Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, it can be a great comic way. Katan, who appears to be expressing Ernst or Pee Wee Hermann, is in a state of chaos. It is sad that Peter Berg and Chris Benn, who portray his ill-fitting brothers, lack much of their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too many and separated by so many boring ones. What I really miss here is what always attracted me to Leslie Nielsen's films. There is no "second level" of wit riding on a slap. There are no cultural signals for adults only. . There is no double participant. . It's just silly. <br /> <br /> By the way, this does not all mean that I recommend it to your 9 year old child, because it is hoped they have a better taste and less charm with some of the body parts and functions.
