Sunshine is a European import group in Hungary between 1880 and 1980. It is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonenshin family. This name translates literally into the sun. The family has modest beginnings, then thrives, becomes mobile, changes its name, and hopes to integrate into the Hungarian society so that successive generations can progress professionally. The story is recounted through the eyes of the eldest son in each generation of the three generations; Ralph Venis plays these three roles. For those who missed World War II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's style of life does not work well. <br /> <br /> The sun is recognized as a technical success, but a missed opportunity. The story line, dominated by the history of the world, is predictable and transparent; this is enhanced with narration audio cover and news bulletin. The family "plot" oscillates from one predictable event [ie. Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The subject of non-central Jewish assimilation, the important sub-themes [memoirs "secrets" and family philosophy] that could have given the personality of the family and its credibility has been lost to the end. Instead, filmmakers provide generational continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Venis presents a glamor of brilliance but his performance is still far from the award-winning material. The "3 for 1" casting format is an distraction for viewers and feels like a gimmick for cheap cinema rather than a good theater. The Sun is basically a "Hungarian History Channel" material. The shape and hair of the war winds are transformed with Forrest Gump transformed with something about sex. <br /> <br />
