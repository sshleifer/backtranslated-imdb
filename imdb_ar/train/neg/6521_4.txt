Maybe I did not give this film a fair shake, so I could not see all that. Maybe if I see her in a theater, in his original show, maybe I appreciate it, but it's too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago The details of the plot have faded from memory. This film did not help, because it is something less clarity and clarity in its presentation of events. <br /> <br /> It's really four linked movies, or a movie in four parts, and I, I think, intended to see more than four nights in a theatrical show. I found the first part interesting enough, but all I could do was sit in the second part, which lasted for a long time. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you have a good translation or you can read it in the original language, his brilliant writings far outweigh any issues one may face in the story. However, in the film, it is difficult to reproduce without having a significant impact. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie that I have seen. It's very cool, there's a lot of camera work that draws attention to itself, rather than working on the story. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I miss something, but I could not summon enthusiasm to move Parts III and IV.
