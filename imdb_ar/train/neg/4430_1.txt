Thanks to Neil Simone's dull, unimportant scenario and a weak direction from Robert Moore, the second chapter became a stark display of Marca Mason, who won one-third of her four Oscar picks for the second season, performing the same performance here in Cinnderella Liberty (73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and only when I laugh (81); this time she just does not have a child walking around. Chapter Two is Moore's third and final feature film, produced by Neil Simon, the cheap detective (78) and willful murder (76). It was miscast, the characters are monolithic, the dialog box is very analytical, and there is almost no specific details. The first half is less than to be asra, meets a nice and attractive romance between the dark Cayenne and the mysterious Suns, and the sad second half makes you yearn for the first half. The sites of New York City as well as the atmosphere of Bologna, and the painfully painstaking Harper Palerie are not relevant, but at least provide some welcome distraction. Finally and finally, there is a terrible song played during credits.
