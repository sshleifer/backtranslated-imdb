I wish I could give this movie zero. Cheesy effects and representation. The only reason to watch this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid who plays Brian. What a geek! I could not believe the mullet! Then there was talk with himself. I think they can not just be silent, but still. Of course they had to make him dribble too thin, not something I wanted to see. But Jared did a great job compared to the special effects department. Everything from the bear to the accident was something I could do for myself, the better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulson had anything to do with production, since the film was not called Hatchit. Finally, I do not think the writer has read the book at all, seeing that there is not one thing. I think the book was fantastic, but this movie is a stink like a foul-smelling goat!
