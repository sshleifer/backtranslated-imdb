Before that, I saw some very bad Christmas movies. But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a fun film about Santa helping some children, but it seems demonic when you watch it. Santa jolly ho-ho-ho replaces a sinister evil laugh, and I'm sure it closed many children's birthday. The plot of this massacre is very strange, commensurate with all the offers and dialogue. Santa lives high above the earth in the Arctic where he and children from all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. The stadium tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by making three naughty boys, creating remittances, like moving the chimneys and making the door handle hot. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it is up to the Santa Pedro and Merlin wizard to take Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, besides being so bad, is very strange. Satan dances a lot and seems more fun than Santa. Santa Claus speaks about giving presents to all boys and girls, yet it seems he only offers 5 homes for children in Mexico. The reindeer is a game of wind, and when the reindeer laughs, I am surprised that it does not bring tears to the eyes of the children ... it is scary. Everything is terrible. The first ten minutes are just playing Santa for a member while children sing to him. One of the strangest scenes is likely to be to shoot Santa in the playground with a small cannon and laugh at her as he dances with pain. I think parents are better at telling their young children about where kids come from than telling them. The only positive is that it will make you laugh hysterically if you can appreciate the bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
