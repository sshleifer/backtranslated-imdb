Definitely a bad film. It's a ridiculous fantasy with lots of bad special effects, lots of fast scenes (airport for example), and a real unreal time. (Charles Dance) is as horrible as the wicked guy and he is much better at (another hero action). (Eddie Murphy) is a funny joke, and I heard that this dribble has already succeeded, has been a great success ?? !! I will not understand why or how? In a television interview, Eddie Murphy, when he was nominated for the 2007 Oscar, heard of his regret in a comic way !! <br /> <br /> A comment (hey ... it's the 80s!) said. Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic folly that has made so many RAZZIE movies over the years, whether it's the eighties or fifties! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons why I write about this film. The first is that I will never forget the charming long legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on the bed before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing a blue shirt and OH BOY was the camera revolving around her bare legs. It must be. But how strange it is! As I watched in the following films and were not pretty again? !! Anyway, the second reason is that I found the title of this movie recently in the list of the worst 100 films ever! <br /> <br /> The bottom line: the bad movie, the Greek legs.
