This is not the worst film I have ever seen, but I can not remember it when I saw a worse film. I thought this would be about investigating an aircraft accident. What was really a soap opera, and another bad at it. They have exaggerated the "conflict" card. The first hour or so seems like a screaming match, with some unlikely scenes. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> A "memorial" scene for 40 or more with the required black umbrellas and rain) for victims of a fake crash was lame and I think it will never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs, unless you are in a "conflict". <br /> <br />
