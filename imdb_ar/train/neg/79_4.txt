The original book was set in the 1950s, but it will not apply to the television series because most people watch the 1930's. Ironically, the tubular train near the end was a train from the 1950s designed to look like a train in the 1930s So the metro can play in that game as well. The story in a plot about Jarrow March was weak, but the 1950s version had students who started to think about the world around them, so I think that making them think of marching poverty is the same thing. All the things Japp had to meet were too weak, but they had to put something to fill the time. This would offer a decent fit for half an hour or you could have pictured the book and make it a better presentation for a long time. This episode is obviously a victim of elegance on content.
