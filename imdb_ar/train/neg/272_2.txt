When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad TV. We were all guilty at one time or another, but my virginity to see things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes the show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12-year-old will love every part of him, every line of stumbling dialogue, every piece of unnecessary technology. The writing is beyond mystery; very cute and uninspiring makes Miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your program makes me look forward to the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> Stargate is a fantastic and guilty fun, with two powerful displays of James Spiderman and Kurt Russell, full of magnificent Egyptian architecture and culture, brilliant musical score, and brilliant scientific ideas. Except for a little original music, nothing appears, making the movie fun in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who aroused MacGyver's interest in the sea and legend, seems to be half asleep most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must be very low because the groups sometimes look like someone's basement. Cinema is not much better, like vanilla and boring like scripts. I am amazed that it appears in much more style (like Farscape), and the material (like the imaginative Battlestar Galactica) contains smaller, less frantic masses of this page. It's just not worth it.
