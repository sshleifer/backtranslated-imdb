This is the "House of Exorcism" page, but most people have confused this film with the masterpiece Mario Bava, "Lisa & the Devil", which explains the ridiculously high classification of "House of Exorcism." When "Lisa & the Devil" was screened at film festivals in the early 1970s, it was a hit. The audience responded well to this wonderful gothic horror film. Unfortunately, it was a little time, and was considered very unusual, not commercially enough for mass consumption. Distributor will not buy it. Alfredo Leon decided to release Lisa, apparently with a saw, by removing about half of the original film and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original! It is important to note that Bava had nothing to do with these new hideous additions, so technically the "House of Evil Spirits" is not a Bava film. The original product is slow, dreamy and elegant production. After a few minutes of the film, the viewer is taken out of this dream world, suddenly we see Lisa, (more than two years old, with a very different hair story), starting to write on the floor and uttering sounds like "my company sucks." , Hidden, huh? The film goes on like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful video and Z "Exorcist". Leon was trying to integrate these shock scenes, while preserving some aspects of the story intact. He failed miserably. When the destruction of "Lisa and the Devil" was essentially chosen, Bava himself refused, saying his film was very beautiful. I have been right, and it must be very sad for this artist to see all his works destroyed and thrown out of the toilet. It has been many years before the original "Lisa and the Devil" was seen again, reappearing on television late at night. I saw "Lisa" a long time before seeing this new version, and it was quite disturbing to watch one of my favorite films "ruined" in this way. Worth watching just for curiosity. Avoid this malicious disaster like plague.
