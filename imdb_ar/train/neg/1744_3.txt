I saw the 1985 film "Boeing Boeing" (which in turn may be inspired by an English film of the same name) long ago. The main story of garam masala is the same - but it is pathetically listed, where the elegant jokes were replaced by routine routines in traditional Indian films (perhaps the director did this to suit the tastes of an Indian audience) ... <br /> <br /> I did not see Original English version. But she really enjoyed the Malayalam film (which was made by Preradarshan himself) and which was a comedy split side, at that time. Of course, the representation of Mohanalal, Mukesh and Sukhumari (who acted as chef) was natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably, I am very fond of the Malayalam film so much that I can not afford even the small Indian remake flaws. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have over-exaggerated. Paresh Rawal did a good job - but did not get anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But in general, compare it with other modern Indian comedy movies.
