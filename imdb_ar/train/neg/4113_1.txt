I have to finish watching a movie as soon as I start, no matter how damaging it is. This film was painful to sit down. The "shimmering" bullets, the "ninja" reporter is like moves, the way the bad guys call hundreds and hundreds of bullets, and they seem to only hit innocent bystanders, and the expected outcome and all bad behavior is terrible. Like a girl who finds a reporter in her friends apartment and turns from "What do you do here (bear the bat)" to "Hey, you are cute, you want @ # $%! ???" In like 1.2 seconds .... just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!
