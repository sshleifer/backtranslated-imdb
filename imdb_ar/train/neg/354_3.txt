Look carefully at the wonderful collection of talents that have been prepared together to make this film: Conrey, Fishburne, Cabchu, Harris, Underwood, Betty, Theben, Even Gemstones by Slesak, Lange, and Plympton. They prove, in the Pistoni, the old saying that can not save a good team in writing bad text. The storyline requires so many leaps of faith from the public that its credibility should have gone beyond Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and "twists" are frankly harsh.
