I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember his title, then browse the horror movies I find and think to myself, "This is the title?" This movie is a kind of Disaster Attack / Disaster Disasters movies with fewer prominent stars in it. It's also fairly boring, since it's like that TV where you can watch the movie fading in front of commercials and so on. The plot has the kind of resorts that the ants have invaded. I think they were a little upset by the construction or something that was happening nearby, but do not quote from it. The most notable ants attack on me in the whole flick was the first attack involving the child who fell into the swimming pool after being crammed and of course the Sumers attack scene as well. Another highlight in this one is the end of the idiot where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, although most of the TV films, this film is very scary and not scary at least unless you feel panic when you see the ants.
