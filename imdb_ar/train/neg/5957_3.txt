It is meaningless in the 1980s, with thirteen out of every ten people, but it can be considered amusing if you see it in an appropriate state of mind. The special effects are vulgar, horrible behavior and the script seems to miss a few basic paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a quiet American city environment where every teenager works at the same dinner, where a cold boy in high school drops cherry bombs down the toilet. Hence, a television expert named Dr. Blake and his pet mind began to look for state-level mind control. Under the title "Independent thinkers", a cheesy brain sends a giant of waves through television and forces innocent viewers to kill! How wonderful is that? Now, it's up to the Meadowvale teenagers to save the world! The crux of the plot is that it does not explain where Dr. Blake is actually coming from. There are clear signs towards extraterrestrial life but this is about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There is not much bloodshed unfortunately and the "evil" brain is like a big sock doll. The most interesting or least interesting element in horror aficionados is a look at the crew and crew of the film making this film. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" (guilty pleasure) and "Plague". Both movies are much better and decided to wisely resign from the film industry. The most knowledgeable face in the crew is undoubtedly the great David Gale, who will be worshiped by horror lovers forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl called Christine Kusak provides a nudity factor and is obviously a great talent ?? She has 3 movies exactly on her repertoire which her "masterpiece". In her first appearance, she was considered a "model" and "three men and a child", referred to as "Jack's Girl". I really wonder how you feel about her career as an actress?
