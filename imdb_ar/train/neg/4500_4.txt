This film is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is a kind of snicker Europeans in. But there are those, not necessarily Anglo-Saxon Yahoos, who do not care about the French; and Xavier's personality will not affect them. <br /> <br /> Let's think about its typical French-French features: <br /> <br /> 1). Sarcastic - very sarcastic. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, a low-nutrition appearance, check, though: <br /> <br /> 3). Great appreciation of the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Ethics of lukewarm work. Check. (Forget the fact that he is supposed to be a rich broker, from watching him in the film, he seems to be putting 10-hour working weeks). <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Though: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage promises. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). The big sexual ego, which says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Whether or not Mo is a pile, there is no reason for it to fall into this clumsy European stupidity other than the text it imposes. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other male reviewers, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's small body. I will give the film four stars; two of them for that.
