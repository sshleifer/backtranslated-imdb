The real irony is that: Joe Beiser was a top notch comedy, in other positions away from the giddy. He had a track record of being very funny and intelligent. Mo, Larry and Chimp had already known him or at least for many years and loved his work. So what was happening on the ground when he joined forces as the "third officer"? Obviously, nothing. In most of the shorts of this late "Stooge" era, more often than not, the boys incite against each other or Joe against two others and this is not Stooge's etiquette. "One for all, all for one person, every man for himself," in the curly words of the "restless knights." There is one thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, and Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other, when the chips are actually broken come to help each other. In this particular, nothing happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight while one tries to deceive others or be bad and bad, not to the comic effect as well. One might assume that there was something behind the scenes happening here, the art of imitating life. Perhaps there was already a reason why Besser did not stay for long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
