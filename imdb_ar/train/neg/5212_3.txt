I realized this film on my shelf for a short time in the Mill Creek group, and one night I decided to watch it; though I did not expect much. With the beginning of credits around I am amazed to discover this film was produced under Filmirage. Filmirage has brought the world to great producers like Troll 2, Ator the Invincible and Quest for the Mighty Sword, so I had to watch. <br /> <br /> The ability to be very decent, even though it was non-native. It would have been possible to improve the scenes of injustice if they were extended and repetitive. But after a while in the film, I started to pace and found myself thinking, "Well, it's better to kill someone soon," or "Someone mutates better". At the beginning of this clouds, when I was thinking about these thoughts, although someone had killed or mutated, but as we mentioned previously, the effects and effects were not very good. First, Dr. Hausman was in the zoo, then he wanted to remember the possibility of killing someone, and finally woke up in a cold sweat in bed - making the public ask "was he dreaming He was in the zoo? " Like movie speed, scene transitions gradually increased. <br /> <br /> I can try to say that the evolution of Dr. Haussmann's character was good, but near the end of the film, that is, once you became a witness, you saw what the doctor turned into, and hope to laugh - that is the real reason to watch this movie once At least; this film works unintentionally like a long wind joke. <br /> <br /> You can also see a mother's costume, which Doctor Hosman has in the film "Quest for the Mighty Sword" by Joe de Amato. In the same year. I liked Filmirage movies, they always use the same stuff!
