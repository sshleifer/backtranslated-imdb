I've always loved Spike Lee, but it was a complete waste of two and a half hours. I was expecting more about Son of Sam and instead I got a film that seems to have nothing to do with the serial killings of 1977. The modern dog was funny (you know you were in trouble when all the sponsors of the film broke into an inappropriate laugh). The whole film seemed very disjointed and not interesting. Sex scenes were unrelated to the plot. I do not oppose sex in movies, but it must have a certain point (unless XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed in this Spike Lee effort !!
