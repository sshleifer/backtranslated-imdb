One of the worst romantic comedy films (no, the worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as an expert in the phone!) Must pretend to be an idiot to move into an apartment with a woman you dream of. The hilarious does not result. Boredom, gay light bashing, terrible dialogue done. If you read Brad Meltzer and admire his crazy dialogue, you will be fascinated by this film. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. If you see this, destroy the version.
