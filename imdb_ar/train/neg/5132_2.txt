I discovered this movie because the Jew Ben Chaplin of Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British comic series and apparently left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this movie. I have failed in thank God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy where Janine Jarvalho plays the role of an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Ouma Thurman so far with Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin will not love her because she is hideous. The film is bad only for many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from explicit slippery bits to serious rattles: to that exact montage where three of them then enjoy the bit of the picture. These two scenes made me cringe! The character of Janine is horribly arrogant (and the guesswork of her role as a "comedy" realistic and feminine in real life as well). She claims that the film is "anti-feminist" while in fact it is just a realist. Men more often than not looking for personal. It is interesting to note her hypocrisy as well. She was a feminist and a "comedian" for years before taking up this role and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I imagine that she hated the idea of ​​this film and its text before it was released, but it made sure to keep it calm so that it could get money for this scorched picture of the film. I mean Come! I acted for it for heaven! What this film was really was hostile to men if it was anything. He portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their wings with men who are doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman Noel. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this film like the character of Ben Chaplin. The British man also finds every pleasant American girl and Jimmy Fox the best symbolic friend of Chaplin. Of course, Fox had to try to imitate his tone several times for good measure. Is this the best screenwriter can find? Blimey did not do so before with just about every film Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore. There is also a very scary sex scene on the phone and it is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. All the other comments here indicate that Janine Jarvalo is not ugly but actually beautiful. Was Erm watching the same movie as they were? Surely they are not viewers and the only good thing about this film is that they were really filmed as unsightly. Although I said so, I have not seen the attraction of Uma Thurman either: she looks stunning and looks forward. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you never see it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what the end will be; <br /> <br /> The phone sex scene will be painfully embarrassing; <br /> <br /> You'll be bored in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
