I was 7 years old when DIR MONSTROSITY was released. In the UK it was announced on television in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were some popular movies. It was actually the first movie I ever saw in the cinema, and I was postponed for years to come. The following week, I was invited to go to watch a new movie "Star Wars" I refused. To this day I have never seen him, protesting against having to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of seven I can say that I was watching garbage. It's very bad, it's almost unbelievable. Waffle that should not have arrived at the cinema. Yet I felt comfortable when I read all these years later that the director never directed again, as much as I was interested. Avoid at all costs!
