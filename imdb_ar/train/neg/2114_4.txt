Once you look at the groups, it is easy to say that the project lacks an appropriate budget. Bella Lugusi may be thinking about things like that. Young brides fall dead at the altar after saying "I do." Their bodies are stolen by Dr. Laurenz, a famous horticulturalist, and a couple of dreaded disciples because his old wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs to inject adipose fluids from the young virgins to remain young forever. Missing the same rare lizard of the altar; the orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be more familiar. Imagine a typical horror movie storm doing a visit to the Lorenz estate a bit scary; especially with a dwarf and hunchback sneak in the workplace. Other players: Angelo Roseto, Tristram Kouffin, Minerva Eurekal and Frank Moran.
