Recently, both the movie and King Arthur have been featured on DVDs chosen by others for "entertainment" on one of the evenings, and they do nothing more than come up with a growing idea that modern film viewing is not discriminatory, As long as he got a "procedure". Both films were absolute garbage. <br /> <br /> What happened to personal development? All that happened to meaningful dialogue? Everything that happened to work? When you see something that claims to be a mysterious "historical", whatever happened to try to get some accuracy, there is a realistic idea about the "political map" of that time, and even some minor flavors of the age, especially in its social attitudes. Why do they all have to show the value of America in the 21st century? I read on the message boards of the disclaimer that "little was known" from the Dark Ages. not like that. There are large amounts known, with lots of scholarships learned in this age, but these youngsters simply can not be bothered to do any homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I would vote 0/10
