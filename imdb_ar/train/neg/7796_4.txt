Wow, this is not only a "new lesson with real bad taste," but also a lesson in "a real bad film industry." Do not get me, I appreciate the concept of "zombie" 90: severe epidemic, but at the same time one must realize when the film is terrible. If you do not miss the story of the film, the "Zombie 90" scheme revolves around a government aircraft carrying poisonous chemicals that occur in the wild, causing chemicals to leak, and turning the local population into zombies looking hideous. The next thing you know is that zombies all over the city eat people alive, while a clumsy doctor and government worker are trying to discover the disease that makes these people eat each other - hence the name "extreme extreme". From then on, all we see is that the zombies spend a day on the field on every local person on the horizon - nothing but the intense de-gouging and the vicious cut-off with endless cuffs of courage and wounds. Since this film is German, the film has to be named in English, and when you do not laugh at feeding the frenzy of the zombie, the sound sounds very fun and entertaining. As mentioned by the user is not certified * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the film expresses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, and here is the scene in which a woman who carries her baby in a wheel around her in her wheelchair from Before some dude and a crowd of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. One of the zombies grabs the baby and tears it into pieces, eating its organs when the child cries. Wow, this new lesson in bad taste REALLLLLLLLLY. Awful to tell you, awful.
