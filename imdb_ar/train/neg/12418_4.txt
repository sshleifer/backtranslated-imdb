I saw this film now, not when it was released and praised it as the best picture of this year in Israel. To summarize everything right now, I will just say: This is not a good film. <br /> <br /> This is the second feature film for Saul's role, and I have to admit that his first television drama was much better. Moreover, this is his first attempt at directing the drama. The early work was comedic, and was funny and effective. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know is if you ever see this movie: Israel in the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values ​​it has represented ever since the formation of the State of Israel. The real situation of the kibbutzim is very terrible, and some of them disappear one by one. The word kibbutz, a collective Hebrew word, was a village for members only, where the values ​​of equality and socialism were the tenets of everyday life. With the change in social values ​​over time, it now appears that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed and the rules of faith were locked, without a reminder. The introduction of capital values ​​and way of life in the 1990s made it very difficult for kibbutzim to survive. The crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for it. <br /> <br /> But I consider that this film has nothing to do with nostalgia for the old days of Kibbutz. Once, it was the dream of every young couple living in kibbutz and raising children in this beautiful and beautiful environment. But the film shows the opposite. The kibbutz, with a socialist ideology, was a place like the worship of crazy people, with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of everyone within the community. This is the central philosophy of post-modern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. You should put yourself in the middle, not anyone else. This is the philosophy represented by the film, and these are only the first sin. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with me on the political side, I'm sure you will agree to the acting, and the tone of the film, it's a script and direction is the next four sins. The film has no real visual text and no memorable footage. It is also very "delicate", an allergy is just an attempt to art fartsy to stir emotions, which do not appear on the surface, not in the film and not with the viewer. It only brings boredom. <br /> <br /> Can someone explain why this movie won many awards? Perhaps because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world and hates social and human values? Or does it appear that Israel is a "sensitive" place and does not give in to faith and intolerance? That we are human beings and very good, capable of agitation, especially when they are fake, just as we expect capitalism? Or perhaps because it tells one of the biggest lies in Israeli cinema in recent years, a lie that undermines the justification for the existence of a Jewish state? Regardless of the answer, it is not a good idea. Not for the world, not for human values, not for Jews.
