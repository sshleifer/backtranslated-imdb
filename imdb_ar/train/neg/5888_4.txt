I've seen this recently on an old VHS bar that's pale, and I remembered it was faint. Looking at it now, it looks charming. <br /> <br /> When it was first released, it was widely recognized by everyone as a parody to leave a gay teenager. In order to reach the main point, the mother sees her reading a copy of "1 Teenager in 10", the most famous book issued at the time. David Warner describes him as a persecuted vampire hunter [= evangelist hates gays], which of course is a self-hate closet case. The list of gags and jokes that have been included to make sure not to miss this point will be very long. The producers had some good fun, and they hoped, no doubt, to relax in addition to Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenager audience will look at this film, for the time being. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrible misfortunes that gay teenagers have to pass through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are a lot of dark and harsh corners on our continent where they were as bad as they always were.
