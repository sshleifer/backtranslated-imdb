I simply can not finish this movie. She was caught after what I will say is my candidacy for the most desperate attempts at the Sex Inspiration Award: a scene in which Pia Zadura stands, in a walk, between boys who want her. One (the good boy) implores her to see her ways wrong. The other (the villainous boy) simply asks whether she likes a hot dog, and who sticks to it afterwards. At the crotch level. I hope I do not spoil anything to say that she is spinning, and take the warm dog with a smile. Only pathetic.
