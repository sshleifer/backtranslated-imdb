The old lady is a nice "straight", desperate for the money to save her house and possessions, grow a "pot" in her house, and smoke him with a few friends who are frequented by the elderly and then sell it. This is the story of this low-concentration comedy, which emphasizes the absurdity of the attitude and some humor brought by the impasse. For many of the movie, it works. Humor is not from a variety that laughs loudly but does not keep you enjoying for an hour and a half, so I think they serve their purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch the leading role. But the end has really destroyed a "nice" film with offensively offensive messages that only liberal radicals in the world of cinema want to see. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I prefer a happy ending, too, but should not be all warm and mysterious for those who blatantly violate the law. Here are also the typical children (1) outside of marriage but this is not a problem and is considered good; (2) images of the clergy as morally weak; and (3) even the doctor who was stoned too! <br /> <br /> Hello? Are the reviewers here a Hollywood explosion? This is a show how a secular society has lowered standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least have an impact on morality rather than anything but Timothy Leary's message "If it's good, do it."
