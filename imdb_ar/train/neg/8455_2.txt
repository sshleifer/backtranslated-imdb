"Brave" does not add anything positive to the kung fu type. The comparison of this blurred film with the inspirational insanity and quality of Stephen Chau's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, fighting scenes are not new. Everything presented here has been done by and better than the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Battles in Motion Pictures need logic. It does not seem to be of any use to make strikes that have no detrimental effect as in the "matrix" sequences. <br /> <br /> The attractive female So-Yi Yoon dropped the screen but did not convincingly overcome the material demands of the role Zhang Ziyi had done so easily in the Flying House of Daggers. Having a martial arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. The selection of inexperienced representatives in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in Asumi) unless you are a very talented director where Arahan proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
