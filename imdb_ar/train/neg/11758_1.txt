I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It is so bad that it is really funny in a very impossible way. <br /> <br /> Gael is very bad, I mean he can not act. He has to give up now, since acting is not something that is obvious to him. His teammates are of the same level, and I am sure that my 5 year old cousin can do better than any of them! The manager should be ashamed to put his name on something ridiculous. Somehow I do not think Oscar is on this person's cards. <br /> <br /> I did not write a comment on IMDb, but it was so bad that I felt I had to do it. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie, it does not matter 0/10 if there is 0
