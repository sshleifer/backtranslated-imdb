The Nutcracker has always been ballet somewhat problematic. This is not much like Eta Hoffman's original story. <br /> <br /> In ballet, the story ends mainly by the second half when Clara (or Mary in this version) travels to the Kingdom of sweets to see a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an endless collection of theatrical performances that reinterpret the story in countless ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet platform. <br /> <br /> The Balanchine version actually has no sense of drama or story at all (although there is much drama and mystery in the first great Tchaikovsky music). The result is a Christmas party in the first half that can be completely forgotten where almost nothing happens and where dancing (little of it) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The pantomime is acting excessively, especially from Drosselmeier, which may seem acceptable on stage, just looking silly pictures of the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (chapter two in the release phase). Although there is some outstanding choreography, most choreography is poor and uninspiring. This is certainly not an old Anachini. <br /> <br /> Palanchin is widely regarded as the master of abstract dance, but I have always felt that he was less successful as the creator of storytelling ballet. Watching this film version of The Nutcracker has only reaffirmed this view.
