Very disappointed forward to the first two films, it did not get any suspense from the first nor the second interest. By focusing on the men who "run" the cube, it basically takes any feeling of tension inside the cube, because we simply do not care about the characters inside. Many of the films are simply boring, and it becomes very horrific considering the superiority of the glass of eyes and the marine soldier with green eyes. After that, though, it descends to the hilarious unintentional. The end is appropriate, with a link back to the first indirectly. The scenario is terrible, the representation is mediocre at best, and the trend is moving. Follow up much less.
