*** possible plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I adore Dennis Hopper. I ask why he accepted the role of police investigator in the movie The Spreading Ground in 2000. This film is sucking flat and I'm about to tell you why. <br /> <br /> It's about a small town about to get hold of a gymnasium. One hurdle: There is a killer on the loose and this is bad for work. The mayor has a deal with the Irish mob to find the killer and make sure he will never bring him to court. diet. Ed Delongbury has other plans. He wants this person to be arrested too, but at the level he believes in the system. He wants to see the system do his job. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good. The installation could have been. It was terrible. First, call this man the serial killer name. No error. There are specific criteria and none of them fit here. Kill the villain 5 children on the first day, I think it was the second day. This entire film runs as a 48-hour period. I do not care what the distorted motives they give him in the end, the serial killer is doing his work over a long period of time. They do not suddenly kill seven children in two days. This is a spree. <br /> <br /> Well, apart from that, the acting was terrible. The only name here was Hopper, the only one who came close to pulling part of it. Unfortunately, it's kind of for me and I think it has much better psychological parts. This was not a good way to hopper. He was not allowed to do what he did better, to act in a creepy way. It's not that he did a bad thing, but I saw him do what was much better. <br /> <br /> Irish mob man, Johnny Gault (Tom Makamos - a long trip on a night trip) is investigating just over a harsh top. contradiction? Not right. He tries to play the role of a hard-boiled man, and he does so to the point that the character is wooden. Extremely tedious. He did not scare me. No feelings at all inspired boredom. I can not tell you how many times you've reviewed to see how long it took until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about it is that it felt like a movie dedicated to television. you know what I mean. Poor production values, low budget, scenes reuse to save costs. Just a. Yanno? But I feel that comparing it with that is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanillent was the director and cinematographer in this project. He has moved farther than he can chew. I can only feel that Hopper must have assumed this role in favor of a personal friend. This is the only rational I can come up with. This was Van Halent's first post as director, and the third as a filmmaker. We hope this is an educational experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end if you decide to torture yourself with this game, but I want to say they all dropped the ball here. .. So Hopper. In a scene that was supposed to be emotionally painful to the detective, it was so .. well .. Blah. I have not seen any anxiety at all would accompany the overall change of this man. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These 100 minutes are cumbersome and long rated for violence and language. No child under 13 will have any interest in seeing this, so do not worry there. It's not suitable for anyone anyway. Hey. <br /> <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later.
