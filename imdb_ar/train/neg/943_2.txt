Here's an impressive little movie that gives the word "low budget" a terrible name. A physics teacher with about nine children creates a strange molecule that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly murdered by fake shellfish from submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a classic B movie resurrection of the 50s, right? Both! It is not an example of fun in high campsites, which is way off the mark. The glamorous display of breast and buttocks necessitates our desire for pleasure, in the face of horror which should have been 99.44% in the first place. Outstanding entertainment at its best, with the help of red blood presses and bodies of dead students. Such hideous films will make Guru the Mad Monk (1970) a clever genius with a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so relax easily!
