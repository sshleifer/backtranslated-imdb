DOWN TO EARTH (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is a hopelessly misleading comedy that makes sitting home on the couch Who is watching a stand-up comedian on a television that looks like heaven. Talking about Paradise, the film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait". It was a good film, and it's good to show how a group of aspiring script writers can take good materials and turn them into waste. Managers Chris and Paul Witz are absent from almost every goal. From concept to storytelling, "failure on earth" failed miserably; this production is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a lousy comedian, both in his role in this film and in real life. He plays the role of Lance Barton, whose director (Frankie Fison) feels sorry for him when he yells on stage during an amateur night at the local theater. Shortly after the scenario is determined by his lack of talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. The death, played by Eugene Levy, was a mistake, and he took Lance before his number rose. The assistant of God (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to allow Lance to make up for the rest of his time on earth, as long as he takes the only body available to a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The name of the old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life suffers from his own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Gregg Germain), who steals his money. But this is all right because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, falls in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King.) Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, and Lance is trying to get a better body, Involving the financial affairs of Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> "The Game to Earth" has some good ideas, but it is in a meaningless and unconvincing love story full of benefits and recycled materials. The biggest problem you face is how to consider Mr. Wellington's Lance. Chris Rock is a popular and popular actor, so you will not miss most of this movie; you see all the characters that the new Lance is Mr. Wellington, but we see Chris Rock. This is appropriate for the story of love. We believe that a young woman will fall in favor of Lance, but in fact, he is actually a strange man, with gray hair. This is not very convincing. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a funny comic stand watching an old man doing funny things by a black guy. But what inspires laughter is when people clash with conflicts without their knowledge. Just take a look at "There's Something About Mary". In funny scenes, characters are subjected to embarrassing experiences, not to their own will. Here, Lance knows that he is in the body of an old man, and does things that are not usually done by the elderly. If Lance does not know the body he was in, he probably has the potential. <br /> <br /> There is another problem in the concept: We did not know Mr. Wellington basically, how can we compare Lance in his body? The body when we do not know what it was originally. To top everything, Chris Rock needs to be the center of attention here, and make your character rock-like. Follow simple routine jokes in the standby mode that are dull and painful; his dialogue is very clear, wooden and direct. I hated the feeling of humor. There are a lot of terrible jokes and horrible comic situations. Chris Rock is like Chris Rock, not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Let's stress the pros in "going back to Earth." Mark Ady does not do worse here than he did in "Flintstones at Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chaz Balmintari are well represented, but at the mercy of the scalp text. These are all the good qualities I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to remember, I'm unlikely to talk anymore.
