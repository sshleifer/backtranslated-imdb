Some movies are so bad that they are good. Obviously this is not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was true to the story, like Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was weak, and walked very quickly. It was as if the director just wanted to finish it and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart never hit me as a talented actress, but then every film she made was very low budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she abandoned her characters by neglecting too much, and talking very quickly as if speeding up her words would make her more dramatic. It really shows that there is a crew in front of her talking to the camera, when she has to involve the viewer in her personality. It pretty much disappoints the entire film, and any leg has left it to stand on, has been ruined. <br /> <br /> Maybe the only good thing about the movie is when it's finally named. But even this was not enough to subdue my hate for such a bad film. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in the movie is more pleasant than a piece of dry toast.
