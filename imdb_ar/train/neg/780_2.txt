This offer is terrible. How George wants his mother's funny death? This offer is terrible. It is clear that the parents are bad and the children must be transferred to the children's services. Witch daughter with B and his son just a complete naughty. George is not funny, especially when talking about his noisy and obnoxious brand of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I have laughed at him several times, but basically how pathetic. George's mother, Benny, in a despicable and despicable character. Surely her husband had left her, but how could anyone laugh at the way I treated George as a small child outside of my domain. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me how George's head is big and funny? It's not that big! I have moved from the characters because they are so horrible and it will take hours to write me down and I honestly do not care enough. I'm interested enough to tell anyone looking at this and I wonder if they would like to watch this show or not, that this show is a magical excuse for a comic series, and not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give 2 starts, because the wife is very attractive.
