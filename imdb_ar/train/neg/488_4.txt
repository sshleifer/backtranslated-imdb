Horrible movie! You have to be against some real stinky nomination for the Golden Globe Award. They took the story of the first famous Renaissance painter and distorted it in a way that can not be recognized. My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with facts; if the story is good, it will be good. But it is simply strange - by all accounts, the real story of this artist would have made for a much better film, why did they come up with this mysterious scenario? I suppose there were not enough nude people in the real version. We ended up hastily summarizing the life of the artist - we could have saved ourselves for a few hours if they would prefer the rest of the film in the same brevity.
