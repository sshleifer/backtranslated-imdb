Perhaps this is the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in subsequent O'Leary films, he was represented by actors much younger than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by well-known actors) gather in an old house (in a rainy place, of course!) to talk to a wealthy relative who goes into a coma. <br /> <br /> While waiting to recover, all sorts of mysterious events occur, including a few murders. A creepy movie. worth watching!
