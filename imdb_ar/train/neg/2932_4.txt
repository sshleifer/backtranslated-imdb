I do not care about that, but I'm not Simon Beige's friends. If you are, there is a good chance that we will continue to have such repercussions. The problem is that he found a successful formula like the humble and ordinary style in Shawn of the Run, Ren Fatboy Ren, etc., but he started wearing. Here his character does not have remarkable qualities, he is rude and obnoxious, and thinks he is funny when he is not honest. When I moved to New York from London (and I assume that this link is intended to attract viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), it proves equally in place with his new colleagues. However, is it odd that Jape japes from his jerky stripper that appears at an editorial meeting in retaliation for his boss. However, somehow, Kirsten Dunst begins to heat him, although he did nothing pleasant. Oh, because he is a superficial man, falls in front of Megan Fox at first sight, perhaps because her character is as shallow as his character. All of this makes the film finale predictable, although I can not see any scenes that reflect how it reflects on their lives. Shame is that the paper is supposed to be worth watching. Pegg, though, plays the same, it seems that Kirsten Dunst only works on motions, does not create any chemistry on the screen, nor spreads Megan Fox at all. Plus a huge one is Miriam Margolis, as her Pegg in New York - now if she's on the screen longer .....
