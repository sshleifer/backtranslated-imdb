This is the worst imaginable folly. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and exciting. The makers of this futile film do not follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred and make free copies of them good if someone has their own ideas. If all you can do is change things and replace them with non-quiet, hidden clich√©s, one should stick to the original. Had they done this film it would have been good at least twice even with the worst actors and if filmed inside a studio with cardboard huts. But there is no fantasy at all just tired. This must be purchased or viewed only by collectors of Victorian novels that have turned into movies. <br /> <br /> Just a tip, not a spoiler, I think, to make those who read the novel understand what happened and what you might expect if you decide to watch this on TV or - God forbid - waste money when you buy this. Gagool turned a charming old paddy into a book and some precursors to Gollum into a cute gal!
