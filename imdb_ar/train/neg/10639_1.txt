Stupid, ignorant, ill-conceived, and lead to murder (where is Angela Jones now gifted?) No wonder Reb Braddock has not directed anything else since - anyone has the chance to make his first film according to his own rules, based on his own scenario , With the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like this, anyone feels that this was a story worth telling the world, and not worth a second break. Under these circumstances, the performances are good - the actors are asked what they are asked to do, and they do it well. It's just that they should not do it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
