This cartoon was beautifully written and cut for two reasons. 1) Perhaps this was the ethic of modernity in the 1950s, but no single man reacted to an asteroid for years with this hysterical negativity on the gift of an Android female. 2) This was not the robot at all, but the woman, Jean Marsh beautiful. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades can return to this episode if it does so correctly. In fact, the software updates sex bots in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was produced, so they could at least act as one. Then he added her fleshy element creepy. Instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans in a distant star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always extended to imagination and credibility. Usually no one cares. But this episode seemed to have faltered because of Calvinist ethics that avoided what could have been clandestine with machine or total neglect.
