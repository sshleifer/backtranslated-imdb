The message of this film is "Personal is more important than beauty." Janine Jarvalo is supposed to be the Ugly Duck, but the funny thing is that she is not ugly at all (in fact she is more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, will this film succeed if the Ugly Duck is really unattractive? When does Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message you want to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
