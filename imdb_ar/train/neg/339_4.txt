Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" or "The Big Trouble in Small China" or "Conan the Barbarian", awesome films that have some calm and humor that criticize themselves and turn them into cults, just bad. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis itself is not applicable, and there are some ridiculous moments. But here, Eddie Murphy's "facial stance" calms any sense of tension or danger in the story. The special effects are silly enough to further damage this tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are defeated rather than relying on them for coercion. <br /> <br /> Without feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are in real danger, why should we care? <br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Many fans of Eddie Murphy who can not help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can not think of anyone Another <br /> <br /> I will give this film 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that succeeded.
