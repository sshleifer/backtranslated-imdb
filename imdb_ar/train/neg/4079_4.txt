I purchased a DVD from this movie for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about paranormal. The film was filmed entirely on the video, so its PBS movie was shown. Special effects are looking through the phone, but in fact there are some scary moments in the movie that prompted us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective panic involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is bad, the "plot" scenes are too long and tedious, and I will tell you that I have no idea what happened in the end. If you got the movie, you hired it, and if you bought it, please make sure to pay less than $ 5.
