Yes, stupid! I just finished watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Lots of colors, lots of unnecessary "additions" to the story, lots of stupid characters (I suppose they want to bring comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... a lot of everything. Shame to spoil one of the divine stories of "Arabian Nights" like this. Childish and na√Øve (be it in a bad way) and with a lot of charming mistakes, I do not think this might keep a child of five children for more than ten minutes. Princess is beautiful, but must be tongue-free, because the actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is worse ... our "bad guy" really bad. Shame that the "good man" is not the best. The only light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who unfortunately goes deep below his level with this, but at least retains the skills of the actor / fighter at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in something like this, but I'm glad I had something to see in a complete farce, so thank you David. Only, for him, I give these two stars to this failure ... I will give him more, but that will lead to the final result of the entire film. The rest is so bad, so much that I would like to appreciate it, but there is no class lover and then 1 here, and I think this will be a lot.
