Patrick Channing (Jeff Cooper) is a student of Satan / serial killer who has the "first power": Even after being arrested by Detective Russell Logan (Le Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he can move his soul from body to body and continue to kill Will. With the help of an attractive psychic Tess Seton (Tracy Griffith, sister of Melanie Gee) the sister tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept may have some possibilities, I think, but in the end "the first" power "suffers from routine scripting and filmmaking, something we have never seen before, and sometimes it was better. About Phillips Phillips is a tough sale as a stern, cynical cop, and Griffith does not seem to be trying hard; the best member of the cast is Cooper's Distinguished Characteristically, he does his best to be very creepy. <br /> <br /> The climax is somewhat silly and the end ends with its weakness. <br /> <br /> Is not really acceptable enough to classify as an average film of its kind, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
