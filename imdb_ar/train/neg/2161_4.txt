Ira Levin's crush on Broadway comes to the screen hardly any flesh on his bones, a mysterious plot with a few tricks and wolves but no one deserves attention. The frustrated writer Michael Caen plans to steal a brilliant young man's work and take it out as his own work; his twisted plan may include the murder of the gifted child, who has made Cayne's wife an intruder. The first work in which everyone is rendered dead is unbearable, with Kayen doing everything in his power to keep pace with progress. Dyan Cannon is incorrect because his wife (she is extremely smart and smart can not be thrown into the hole) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the movie) is very uncomfortable in the role of the best writer. These three characters, and her irritating neighbor to Irene Worth, are so indeterminate that what happens after the preparation barely registers even after the second act begins. The direction of Sidney Lumet is stunning and mysterious, its design unconvincing and poorly disguised, and the ending is a complete disaster. The actors struggle to give the text some substance, but with this kind of material, all we see is their arduous efforts. * 1/2 of ****
