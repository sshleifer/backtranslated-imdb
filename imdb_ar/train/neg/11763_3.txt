Yes really. I will admit it. All the fuss surrounding this piece of work has been confirmed by the experiences and tribulations of six people living in Mexico City with regard to their sexuality. So, I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican film (through the ages) that was famous and enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately the film was quite disappointing. The story gives us a couple of couples, both of whom have very obvious marital problems. When a third party comes to the lives of each couple, their problems reach a focal point. Or absolutely silly. The plot then turns into a battle between the sexes. The attitude taken by each group (yes, they are literally a group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is stupid and blatantly childish (I think humor was supposed to be there). The whole thing is from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Ms. Zavaleta) to medium (Mr. Pecher), with Serrano doing an acceptable work on the primary opera. However, the flat conditions that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the poor (if not stupid) portrayals of sex in a mature relationship, etc., make the film fail. A terrible failure. SpyL got a good reception (impressive) at the box office. Believe the hype at your own risk.
