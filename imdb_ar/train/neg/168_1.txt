Despite the first decent season, this series has not come close to realizing its potential. He was nominated as a prelude to the original "Star Trek" series and was almost judged from the start by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt he had to limit and restrict what Star Trek could be Increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The real enemy, Branon Braga, did not help things by rephrasing it that was not inspired by the previous episodes of Trek's journey and its vague disregard for the inner legends of excellence (it was painfully clear earlier that he was only paid). I have never seen a series of events that have consistently hurt a group of talented actors (except for Jolene Blaylock) for a long time. It seems as though the entire series was produced in a bubble outside the contemporary television scene where the audience (even the Trekker audience) is more in demand and evolving in their exciting wishes and desires. Unfortunately, Berman and Braga seem to have succeeded in persuading the top rise in Paramount that Enterprise had suffered from the "fatigue of privilege" and that its main audience had not moved away but was expelled. He produced a high-quality presentation that conformed to the ideals and high standards of his ancestors and would come (the audience). <br /> <br /> Simply in the world of TeeVee, where offers such as "Battlestar: Galactica" are presented, the powers of "Shield" must be given to the public to "Star Trek" viewers, who raise the level of competition and compete heavily. It's just plain and easy.
