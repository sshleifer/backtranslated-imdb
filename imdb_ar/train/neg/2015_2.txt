I really looked forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jean-Michel Vincent and I was a flying nut and I have a serious love relationship with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes imagination to an incredible level. The world record for helicopter speed was recorded at 249 mph by Westland Lynx a few years ago. The only helicopter that was the fastest ever was the Lockheed AH56A pilot in 1960. It collided with more than 300 vehicle helicopters, which meant it had a drive promoter at the end of the fuselage that provided propulsion. <br /> <br /> In short, a helicopter can fly more than 275 because of the principle of round wing flight. And Bell 222, the "actor" who pictured Airwolf was not too fast even by helicopter standards. Production did not last long. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that was shown during this period called "Blue Thunder" and was more realistic.
