I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and I've probably reviewed Buster Keaton movies for IMDb more than anyone else. I've reviewed every film he created from the beginning of his career to the early 1930s with only two exceptions, so you can say I'm a big fan. That is why I find this episode very painful and difficult to see. I loved this guy's movies and I kept thinking "Buster, how can you?" Well, now that I've thought about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton played the role of starring in this terrifying episode of the Twilight Zone. He lost much of his wealth after an anarchic divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and loved his reemergence, so he paid off to anyone who wanted to pay - he appeared in Beach movies and this mess of a series of great serials. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this episode is that it is terribly written and deserves a much better Buster. The show is supposed to be funny, but it's not, instead of silent films watching the show - especially as Keaton puts on this stupid time helmet and all the bad titles. For yourself, skip this - it is a pale imitation of the greatness that was once Keaton's life !!!
