The "Seduction of Students" is found by The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the office and attracts the attention of young and young Corey Sevier. I speak for myself, I can honestly say that there are no teachers who save anyone doing anything for you periodically when I was a student. That was Mrs. Diaz, who was a high school music teacher. Even when I was a little gay girl, I could see what she was doing for the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had and that could have been played by Elizabeth Berkeley in any way. <br /> <br /> Corrie is also an emotional person. She is also used to using her way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that it comes from wealthy parents reinforces this belief. It is an ingenious chemistry which Berkeley learned and to maintain its cumulative rate, it agrees to the teacher, but do not believe it. <br /> <br /> So when he tries to rape and does not get an answer, it hurts me. When Berkeley comes out of the canals and informs the police about the crime, the police who take into account the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay Letorno do not believe here. Sever's parents have the ability to get good publicity about it for their boys. <br /> <br /> Seduction of students is a misnomer for one title if there is one trash all the way. After Berkeley's beating of the showgirls, this television movie was not a bullish career.
