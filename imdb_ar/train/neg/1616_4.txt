Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> This second batch of Che films moves the story forward until the late 1960s, Where the man now moved his fighters from the resistance to the hills of South America, where they survived without enough food and water as tensions rose between the group. Everything reaches its peak when it crosses the border into Bolivia and government forces intensify their campaign to overthrow it. <br /> <br /> Without flipping between the time and place of the last film, the second part of Soderberg focuses only on working in the hills, and can be a more boring experience. More exciting is that the result has sunk, giving the second batch more undesirable atmosphere than works of art that prove to be just alienating. There is only the unmistakable air of boredom for a film that never goes back. You can not confuse Soderberg's ambition or the leadership of Del Toro in the leadership role, it's just a shame that things somewhere in production have been able to make such a disappointing switch. **
