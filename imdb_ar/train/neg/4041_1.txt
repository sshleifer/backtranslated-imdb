Such as wearing a hair shirt. Definitely, certainly, without a doubt one of the worst films ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. Long, hard, tired, humming, self-conscious, theatrical, and artistic scene after another. She intends to be like a dream and impressionism, a dull spirit, rather a huge horseman instead. <br /> <br /> Father and son compete naked and whisper to each other like lovers. "Erotic human race" is the point, loud and clear. Well, what about it? <br /> <br /> The son's repetition more than once is the line that is supposed to have been lifted from the "life of the saints", "the father's love is crucified, the beloved son is allowed to crucify." Parallel to God and his Son, Christ, the hardcore, irrelevant, and bombs, like everything else here. "Little Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Sons" (1997); "; And, of course, Dostoyevsky," Karamazov brothers. " <br /> <br /> The credits in English refer to the intended international distribution, which means that you can not use the excuse that you should be Russia to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is nowhere near as much as the Russian "Sokurov" (2003), as in his book "Mother and Son", in an equally powerful private place, some scenes The mirrors are distorted, but not very interesting. The film is almost monochrome, shot from start to finish by beige filters, making it visible as it is very conceited. Soft fog adds to the anesthetic sensation only. <br /> <br /> There is annoying droning sound, never closing, like a loop of tape. An old radio plays continuously in the background. Russian romantic grief is infinitely extended "as objects based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of "sound designer" (Sergei Moskov), of course, indicates that all those who irritate small voices, radio static, noise, distortion, etc., are "determined". <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that one of them (Sergei Botipolov) wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as traffic, as if worn by bored representatives, appears from nowhere to nothingness. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally succeeded in referring to something without being the object, so what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a crust, but not even a shell, just a shell idea. Can one ask for a better definition of degeneration?
