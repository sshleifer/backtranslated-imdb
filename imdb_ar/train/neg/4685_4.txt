Until the last minutes of the movie, I would give the film a 7 or 8 star rating. However, the end is so awesome and "Hollywood" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility of being ordered to fire its nuclear missiles. Captain, Jane Hackman, is everything to launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, supports the confirmation of the launch orders first. The problem lies in the release of the captain and the first officer must use the launch keys at one time. Hackman is absolutely determined and Washington stands firm until this finally leads to an armed rebellion on the sub-ship. In the end, the mistake was discovered and the rockets were not fired. Wonderful. However, here comes the part that does not ring true. After returning to the floor and moving forward in front of the review panel, Washington and Hackman (who spent half the film trying to kill each other) shook hands with each other and all the friends were friends! Hey! Very vulgar to make the film worth while for me.
