The first in the series was wonderful, easily one of the best horror films of all time. This is the craziest. When I sat down to watch this thing, I was really thinking about how bad the fourth and fifth situations would be and it would be good to be well after my terrible precedent. The boy was wrong. Unbelievable error. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes of it, I was actually tempting to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it would get better. did not happen. <br /> <br /> This is not just an awesome film in itself, it did not need another supplement, because the last two films (fourth and fifth) were really too bad! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back? The acting was TERRIBLE, the story of the story was predictable and folly and it also had flaws in it. The way they made Springwood was completely wrong. Do not respect the first one at all. To add to that, the whole thing seemed too much. <br /> <br /> Some people say this is a "funny" movie. This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be "funny"? I would call it funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a horror film and not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not that information appear as in the first!? The end was also just stupid and cheesy, just like the rest. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. It only appears up. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Wes Craven has invented something good at first, yet it must be dragged because of the trash that belongs to the box. They should not be bothering making this film. Nor any of the other disciples, except the third. The third is the only decent among all the sequences. <br /> <br /> If this is a DVD itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD collection that I got, I would suffocate it when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel. <br /> <br /> - A complete jolt of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please, do not waste your time on this junk worthless.
