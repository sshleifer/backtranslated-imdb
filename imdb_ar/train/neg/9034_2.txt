The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I did not understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. In the meantime, Milvin Douglas plays his natural unwanted role, but Constance Bennett is just a character except for a couple of her screams that were funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young has the best role in the film. I hope he has more lines, because he disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look very small. I've only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late 1960s to the 1980s and an old misguided woman. Wisely, perhaps the best part is the last few minutes when we see an amazing man doing amazing things on skis and pretending to be Douglas falling on the slopes. Those were amazing shots and humorous. <br /> <br /> In general, I can see where this movie - the last Garbo movies - was not successful at the box office. It goes on too long and continues to deceive. It's a disturbing story. Garbo was also known, and was called quitting smoking.
