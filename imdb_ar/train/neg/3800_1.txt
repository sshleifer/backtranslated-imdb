Calling the most pathetic piece of film ever in history is not an easy task. The candidates are too many, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite since I saw it. It was very enjoyable as we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed hard as I was actually trading on the floor. (This usually happens only when I see "Scott of the Antarctic" by Monty Python). <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the viewer captures the viewer. I am quite confused that this clumsy home video has reached the production stage. It's supposed to be a sequel, but it does not have any clear connection at all with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" female, although it took half way in the film to stop guessing, what about all the barbarian muscles and Bedouin costume! <br /> <br /> It's not a conspiracy at all, it's just a long chase, it's so slow and so meaningless that calling it a chase scene makes it look more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which studies its quality well, and then the film suddenly ends abruptly after a scene of scandalous movement with a lot of gasoline explosions, without ever explaining what is going on around him. Fortunately, do not ever get bored, because there is something silly and raging happening at all times! <br /> <br /> The horrible movies are usually boring, but the Nemesis 2 is a perfect combination of extreme seriousness and total ambiguity that's really amusing. Rent this movie, or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
