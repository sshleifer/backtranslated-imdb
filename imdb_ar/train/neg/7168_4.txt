The author came up with a good idea of ​​a story, but many flaws in the plot took a lot of film to make it inaccessible. Basic elements such as personal development have been polished, at best. Variations also raised their ugly heads. A huge palace in the middle of rural Irish countryside? The characters "appear" in the gardens during a stormy night (in very comfortable times, may add)? All in all was not "bad". Classified as 4, mostly based on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
