Slaughter the story of revenge by a nerdy man who has fallen victim to one of the coolest and coolest jokes in the history of cinema. Unfortunately after a promising opening the flick went straight to hell. The mess is very tedious and redundant with an average cut and a half-hour finish that sucked on a whole new level of absorption. The person who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick release. If you want to rent a flick stop after a joke and remember, choose life.
