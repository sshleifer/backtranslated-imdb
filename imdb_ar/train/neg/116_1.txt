I can not believe that those who praise this film here do not think about some other films. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be a bad thing, but the scenario (or not) makes a meaningless film too. On the positive side, the overall level of the character by the actors and the technical staff is perfectly qualified, but when you have a sowing voice to work with, you can not make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick to any other film they have. Dorothy S fans must stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Last Show and goal. Laughing cheap lovers at the expense of those who seem to be asking about it, they must stick to Peter B's book surprisingly, "Unicorn killed."
