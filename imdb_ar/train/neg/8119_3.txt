First of all, there was really nothing in this film that really caught me. It was not a bad film, it was another film where I said, "Well, it was not anything special" after I saw him. There may have been drama and things, but she simply did not hold me, but filled up like bored. As I said in the title, they were soldered quite cheaply in some way. The quality of the film itself (pictures) was welded with low quality and reminded me of some cheap films made in television films rather than a respectable English filmmaker. The camera angles and footage were very amateurish as I think. You do not have any close-ups or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I did not watch many English movies, and the films I saw did not really affect me anymore, but they mimicked something similar in camera work, colors and the like. I tried the "game" to be more wonderful and worca and stylish (see my review of "Lola Rennt" for this if you want it), but it did not work too. Overall just a little indifferent film was not anything special (at best, I'm afraid) unfortunately regretted more than two hours.
