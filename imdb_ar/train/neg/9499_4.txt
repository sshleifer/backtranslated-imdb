I thought the film was a bad documentary. We did not discuss anything substantive. It seems to reduce ideas and offer nothing new. The film lacks wonder, romance or anything that would drive one to science. Most scientists looked "typical" and sometimes strange. A woman said her awards did not matter much, but only the children who received help. She said that after a 10-minute scene I explained all her prizes. Play "humble world", are we? "I have the equations of dancing in my head," another said. I do not see how that explains anything to us. It did not cover the important effects of science on our culture. Science policies were barely addressed. <br /> <br /> This was not a bad joke for children aged 10-14. Otherwise, I felt it was dull and unclear. <br /> <br /> 4/10
