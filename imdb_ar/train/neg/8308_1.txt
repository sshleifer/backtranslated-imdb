Entertainment began the night to fall over the past few years, but as of last night (August 17, 2006) they reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to try to increase the broadcast, they decided to publish the actual pictures of JonBenet Ramsey's body in the straits last night ... saying "photos of the case have never been seen before." The pictures were very sketchy and disturbing. One of them was from the side of her face and head / neck, and you can clearly see the rope that was used to choke her around her neck, bruises on her face. This was very awful, I could not believe it. How does this relate to anything remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ?? nothing!! Their level of dignity and values ​​has dropped to a new level .... this shows. This was the first show to watch ... It's just rubbish now. <br /> <br /> I will see Access Hollywood from now on.
