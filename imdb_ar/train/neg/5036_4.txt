Sweet Sixteen (1983) ** / ***** 86 mins Director Jim Sutus Representatives of Bob Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Alyssa Shirley, Patrick McKinney, Dana Kimmel <br /> <br /> The 15-year-old bad girl A desert city It was not long before people around her began to die. The investigator must combine the clues with the help of his daughter, Nancy Drew, who played on Friday with 13-year-old Dana Kimmel. Local Native Americans are the main suspects because they appear to be bothering the town's population. All of these events lead to the discovery of the killer at Melissa's 16th birthday party. <br /> <br /> This moderate person below the average can not be forgotten. It is specially designed for television sensation, without scoring too much along with the title song that plays several times all the time. Lines like "Killer will turn us into a coleslaw". Fall into the standard 1980s. Marcie Melissa names a bad name, then develops friendship immediately. Obviously, Marcy sees how difficult it is to fit because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. The film will be heavily compressed to be made today, and the main character will be fifteen years old and the director will include many unwarranted close associates. Social commentary on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I am very surprised by the fairly high rating that this film gets. Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the ability to take advantage of the celebrated tradition of the Christmas party to create an intense sequence of the massacre, but I feel a failure to achieve it. But on the bright side, releasing such obscure movies on a DVD gives hope that others will follow them.
