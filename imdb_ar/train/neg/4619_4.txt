Let me first recall that I like the stories of the West and civil war. I also consider John Ford an excellent manager. I also have the same high feelings of John Wayne and William Holden's ability to act. <br /> <br /> I can not remember whether I saw this movie when it was first introduced in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it after that. <br /> <br /> According to my fourth classification, one can say that I did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> I will now try to learn some of its shortcomings. John Lee Maheen, who wrote a screenplay by Harold Sinclair's novelist, was a very talented writer and wrote many good scripts, this poorly written script and bad research. Recall the terrible conditions of the Andersonville prison, at the time of the movie Andersonville was not in a running state. They also use guns that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been directing films for over 40 years and won four Oscar Awards. You should be sick while making this. His usual style was missing. Perhaps this was a film in the south and east and not in the Valley of the Monument. <br /> <br /> He usually had a company of players that used him in almost every film, most of whom were missing this time. This time only the young cowboys Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except the three stars. (See below) Fords stock company in most of his classic films that were; lost sadly here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The duke also looked sick, he seemed out of place here. This type of role usually fits his style perfectly, it was appropriate here. Wiliam Holden did his best, but was not in as good a place as he normally was. <br /> <br /> A representative of this type of film was required. Here in her first major role (the second film), Constance Towers, a very beautiful figure, but not really represented, she still plays roles in television. Let me be nice and say that she had a long career, relying on her appearance more than being a talent for acting. Also in California, tennis player Altha Gibson, Miss Towers' maid, is delighted with tennis. <br /> <br /> The balance of production was far from the usual high level of other John Ford films. A few military type songs are supposed to be done by the March Knights, not good at all. The scenes were good but they came at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Assessments * 1/2 * (of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
