Words can not describe the horror of this film. I saw it on a video last night and simply could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" revolves around a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for kidnapped sister captured by Rednecks-style delivery. The film's representation, writing, directing, filming and editing are depressing along with a song called "The Soldier", which must be one of the worst songs ever! <br /> <br />. "Horshack" (Ron Palio) of "Welcome Back Carter" in the film plays a bad and funny man. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at all costs.
