The film is a little boring. It is mostly a silent film, with the bulk of the story being presented through a series of vocal sums. While making a silent film like this is not a bad idea, it is one of those films that makes it a lack of dialogue and early repetitive scenes are boring. You do not understand the cause of boredom until a long time in the picture, and then it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is a slow piece of Mexican soft porn, soft pornography is unimaginable in it. Later in the film, the first 40 minutes method began logically, but too late, because by then the audience lost. There are some wonderful sites launched at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I have often wondered why more films are not filmed there. The campus is built on the edge of the lava fields that give the campus a very strange feeling. My biggest problem in the film is that the director / writer made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard to how to watch the viewer who does not know the story. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
