I really do not get all the statements I received this film. It is difficult, unnecessarily manipulating and avoiding many big issues - Nash's affairs and his tendency to have sex with men in public places. I assume that this in the context of the Hollywood film business is acceptable, but what is commendable for the performance of Russell Crowe? The man seemed to be mingling, clutching his bag and wearing a grungy hat, and he seemed to be behaving well? Anyone who knows someone who has mental health problems will realize that Crow's performance is a bit of a cartoon. It is also somewhat offensive. I dare say, only on the right side of being really terrible
