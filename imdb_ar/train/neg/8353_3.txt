Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who also took out), an old gambler, wins the young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (beautiful, but not talented Brooke Shields) in poker. The two potential couples (of course) start looking for Indian gold at the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there is no need to look for a deeper meaning. It's not just there. Representation is also very weak, which was very surprising given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some good looks at Brooke Shields. However, her character is very disturbing (especially at first) and she is so stupid that she never comes as sexy or attractive. Very bad, but looking at the story, I doubt that more can be done. I wonder why Peter Fonda came out and starred in this film. He must have even spoken with his father (Henry Fonda) to the veil (useless) in this absurd mess. Unfortunately, this film was the only one together. Can not be Henry in EASY RIDER for example? 10/03
