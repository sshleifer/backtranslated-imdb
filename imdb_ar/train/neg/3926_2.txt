This Italian film is basically a soap opera with leather. <br /> <br /> The VHS said it was classified as "R" but in the actual tape inside it said "X". The latter is more logical because there is a short scene near the end that was awful. Even in the dark, Dutch actress Marishka Dietmers can perform all the sex on this man, and yes, you can see his penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time that the "main line actress" did something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> The marches were destroyed in the open in several scenes but her face was better than her body. They looked pretty. Unfortunately, the film is ugly .... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite the appearance of Detmers.
