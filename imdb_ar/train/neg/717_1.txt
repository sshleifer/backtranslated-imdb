It was supposed to be a parody on the LOTR trilogy. But this was one of the most horrific movies I have ever seen. Bad behavior, bad script, everything is bad. This is my personal opinion. I do not doubt at any moment that there are people who would like this sense of humor, but there was a better parody in the films than well-known directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I was working in a movie theater and in a DVD store. The success of this film was similar in both areas: in the movies it was a great success (but not at all great) during the first two weeks but then, when reviews from those who saw it were not very good, The film is very fast. In DVD sales, it was good for a short time but then no one asked. In the last 10 years, the worst two films I have seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which is worse, but I'm happy there are a lot of good films so I do not have to think much about this.
