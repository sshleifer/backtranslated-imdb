Someone needs to send this man Uli Lommel to the MOVIE SCHOOL. Who told him before that he knows how to make a film? Can anyone make films these days? In the past, talent was always required before someone could produce a film. After watching the lame BTK movie and other films he made, it seems blatantly clear that the poor man has a lot of work that produces films as I do. In fact, I think I can even make better films than Uli LAME-ALL. This film has nothing to do with BTK Killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. This is. Where did this man get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the energetic waste in the film? This is a classic example of a person trying to entice people to watch his film based on the term "BTK" because of his fame. Totally pitiful. The only serial killer I will consider WORSE is the movie "DAHMER". This child was smoking a lot of cigarettes, which made me feel nauseous. Whoever makes this needs to shoot.
