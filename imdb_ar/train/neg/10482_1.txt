One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How do you define "the worst?" Better take out all of the eyeballs then force them to make use of dancing them more than ever to watch this pathetic smashing again. In one way or another, One-Hit Wonder Zwick runs a film that offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay's salesmen, Las Vegas, gay men, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a rude farce, so she forced her to abandon her. How Elvis Presley Enterprises can allow the rights of actual Elvis songs that are used in a central premise film that looks like "Elvis Presley's only good is the dead" is beyond my control. The worst part of this mess - which requires some work - is the distorted text: in 1958, the lyrics and songs of Elvis were recited in the 1970s! Worst special effect? Oscar will go to the idiot who decided that the Elvis tomb, probably the most photographed tomb in the world, resembles a pyramid with a golden record on top and located in the middle of a park somewhere. Probably the biggest audience in this film is a fan of Elvis. However, the rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis the DEA badge, not the FBI credentials ... I can continue to work) actually reduces that conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid film. It's really a terrible film.
