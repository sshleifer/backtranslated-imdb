Daraar started a good start. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat and I wonder what will happen next. Otherwise, the first half of the film is the total BORE. All the first half of the film revolves around the fall of Rishi Kapoor in the wake of Chawla's passionate love. By the way, do not you think it's too old for her ??? <br /> <br /> Things finally started to spice up in the middle of the movie when Gohy tells us about her ex-husband; It was very over-protective, obsessed with a very hot smell! He used to hit Juhi poor without good reason! One reason I do not really like this film is that I can not stand to see Juhi (the favorite actress) being so abused. This film in general has a lot of abuse and bloodshed. I find it very troublesome !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're considering renting Daraar, you should put it on the shelf where you found it and choose something else!
