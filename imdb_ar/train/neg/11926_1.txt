I rarely move to make this kind of comment, but after sitting in most awful Rankin movies, I feel like I've really won to say what I feel about it! I could not do that in the end, and I became one of more than half or more of the infantry (about a third of the audience) after a rough plot, and the sad dialogue and profanity became too much. This film is everything and not art. Each style and any material. It is burdened by horrific acting, a truly terrible script, indifferent cinematography and production values ​​at the student level. How I got the funding started, and the mystery ended for me. I bet you're paying for a million, it will not last at all. The proper critics are shredded. Really bad film. Shockingly bad. Really really very bad effort and this without recalling until the moment the meaningless newborn in the cat's kitten. Completely meaningless, quite lightweight, weak together. This film is a terrible embarrassment to British cinema.
