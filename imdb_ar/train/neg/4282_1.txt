I simply can not understand why all these effects of the Ceausescu era refuse to be abandoned. One can clearly see how frustrating they have been in censie censorship, which has prevented them from showing many things in their films, and now imagine that they do not know much of artistic freedom, so fill the screen with people who shriek, mumble, yell, curses, and any other hideous kind imaginable. This is not a cinema, friends and neighbors! This is simply a visual distortion. Sean Bono and Shawn Ando, ​​for David Lynch, have forgotten about Forman and new realism and other filmmakers who were able to work with the aesthetics of ugliness. These people were mastering their jobs - well, you do not do it! Do us a favor, all you have Daneliucs, Nicolaescus, Saizescus, Muresans, Marinescus, Margineanus and other old people who are obsolete, and left us alone! It's time to see some Romanian movies on the screen, enough with your immature novels! You are not a manager, you are not interested !!!
