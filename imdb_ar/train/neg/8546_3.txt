The Spanish production is unreasonable, unreasonable and inconsistent about ... well, let me see how close I am. The film begins with a woman who kills a girl from her cat. Then she begs her lover to take her somewhere in his vacation. He calls for work and asks him to lose his vacation time and says he will pay for it. What matters is guessing anyone at the end of the film, because the mysterious photographer is spying on Patty Sheppard, the Spanish horror queen, who seems to be taking her bikini top temporarily so he can take a picture and ask her out for lunch, Mount Witches - For other reasons, we are never familiar. Before they leave, Patty must stop at home and loudly "strange" echoing our heroes. Again, this has never been explained. The film continues as these two people stop at the inn, go to the mountain, and finally realize why the mountain is named Mount Witches. As you know, there are many aspects of this film that make it better than the bad movie. He has some atmosphere, some really good actors (especially the Deaf officer and the old woman), and the bonds are at least adequate, and their climax - though meaningless at all - is well designed (literally) with witches in white brasserie and black hair Long. It has no meaning though, and this detracts greatly from me. I was able to watch the film ten more times and still do not know more now than I knew after the first viewing. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film of a long series of cheap European horror films and the atmosphere that covered that decade. If you can get more of me, power is better for you.
