A TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse was brought to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of the first DeMille Ten Commandments that woke up when DeMille groups were discovered in the desert. <br /> <br /> The movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question was, were the filmmakers serious or joking when they made the film? If this is serious, it is a bad film and a wonderful film to enjoy. If this is a comedy, it is less quality but funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard in this film, probably more than many "comedy" in Hollywood.
