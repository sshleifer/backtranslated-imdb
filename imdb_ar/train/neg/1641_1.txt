This film is not funny. It's not amusing. Do not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor lead you to interest in letters or position. Plus it is a short film like anything in modern memory. It seems as though a group of high school kids aged 14 to 15 who never met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl sat down and wrote a film based on their misguided fantasies about how an adult would be. This film is boring, and amazing, and sometimes it is offensive and disgusting. At most, contains moments or moments that make you laugh. Also, it seems twice as long as 85 minutes run time.
