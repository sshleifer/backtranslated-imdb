First of all, I must make it clear that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why or why. When you discover things in the end, you realize that they are just a twisted Suad opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate children ... characters are rather poor and actors (especially young people) do not do much to make ' . Marissa Paredes stands out only, but she is a wonderful actress, regardless of whether the film is pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only positive things that can be said about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the injured Pablo Malo has good intentions, and has seen a few severe scenes ... well, perhaps next time ... < > My rate: 4/10
