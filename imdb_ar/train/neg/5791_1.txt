As a professor of original cinema, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst films with local content I have ever seen. Better get the root channel than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes and ineffective attempts to use parts of traditional wolf stories and poor camera work has been exacerbated by the open story line and the bad scenario. The writer and director showed the worst parts of the colonialist approach to portraying indigenous people and local communities. If he is an indigenous person, he must go home and apologize to everyone he knows for being an apple and for internal racism and a bad sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is not indigenous, they must seriously reconsider their white privilege and ask themselves whether they are presenting a deliberate or unintentional racist or unintentionally ignorant. My only hope is that the original actors in this film spent at least good time and got money for their efforts. If you want to watch good original movies, check it out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Out, Madison River, Bau Wo Highway, Smoke Signals ... to name a few.
