This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. What a wonderful waste. This is James Cromwell as a clueless playboy. I could have continued, but obviously I will spend more time in this review than ever before in the script. The only thing this movie is about is that we are against them and how to expose ourselves in a cynical slowness beyond any reasonable person. This is one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
