This is the version hated by the author, because it is Shalmtzi. They gave him a happy ending and changed a lot of dialogue, just a big pile of saccharin. The "theater director" is very good, and I think the role has grown up, but everyone is in the 1940s' acting style, which is really just a show. One great feature - music. This contains one of the best ratings ever recorded, and deserves a search in a recording store. In general, I think the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller is much better.
