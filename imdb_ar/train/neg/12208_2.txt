As an Army veteran, I felt deeply insulted to this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SSF soldiers I knew was insulted by this nonsense is an understatement. If the movie was shown as satire or even as an animation, it would have been better received. But it is taken very seriously by many people, especially abroad. Silly as it seems, wherever I went in Europe in the late 1980s, people seemed to rule me and the Americans generally on this film. unrealistic? Well, let's see. Cretan is withdrawn from the monolayer, linked to the muscles of the prison work gang to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to free some American prisoners of war. In an ongoing battle, about 500 enemy soldiers are killed by an M-60 submachine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never warms. He never misses, running with a 32-pound revolver with one arm. I can continue, but I get a headache. I was given this 2/10 only because it was a bit better than Rambo III.
