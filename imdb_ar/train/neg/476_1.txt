When converting a book into a film, it is generally good to keep some intended tone of the author or movable concepts, rather than completely ignoring the author. While it is clear that the director has been able to access and go to the advice of Elinor Stewart's children, it is worth noting that the children believe that their mother is completely false with regard to their good, exciting and encouraging experiences in re-owning their land. . The book separates her life from the homes of her neighboring husband in the vast Wyoming border; recounts daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, even though they lived tens of miles away. The film, however, takes a unified view of the time it was produced, portraying the experience of this woman as cruel, intolerant and almost meaningless. The director may have brought some of his experiences in the Vietnam War with him to this film (as some movie fans have said), but this seems to be a bad excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book into a gloom, the hateful scene devoid of friends or hope. Do not waste your time with this movie. Read the book instead.
