I usually comment only on the films I love, where I calculate "everyone according to his / her taste", but here I want an exception. The premise of this film, which seems to be somehow lost in the shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, the sugar, the marriage, and inflict untold suffering on their children's words. Even with culturally acceptable addiction, they do not have the courage or the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and back away from what they have unleashed. After all, "love" is all that is important, right? To hell with everyone. Whether things "succeed in the end" or not is really not the important point; in fact it is totally irrelevant. The important point is that the lack of respect for others, especially if they are young, especially if they are in a dependency, is highlighted and enhanced by this film. There are more benign behaviors that can be carried out by "parents" that could have led to the fall of an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.
