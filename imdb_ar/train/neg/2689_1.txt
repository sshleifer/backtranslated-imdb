Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hated "September 11". This film was, in general, bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu, who was the most effective and direct on the subject, short films were at best boring, and at worst abusive. The worst thing in my mind is the false Joseph Shahin segment, in which Palestinian suicide bombers compared American soldiers, even if he went so far as to point out that the suicide bombers were fighting for a bigger cause. The part was completely off-topic, and because of Shahin's lack of composure at all, it was a waste of my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to film a film that presented their views on the tragedy was a good idea on paper, but in practice it had no taste.
