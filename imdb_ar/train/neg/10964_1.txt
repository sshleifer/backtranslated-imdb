I was not lucky enough to see this at the Side Walk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. As a loyal fan of Louis Alice's book Alice, I was very enthusiastic about the prime minister in this film, which made him more uncomfortable to watch. Usually I am excited to re-talk if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see the similarities between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was less modern and more than a distortion of pop culture. The adaptation of the original characters seemed to be an event and proved to be very annoying. Maybe that did not help that the actors were not good either. Most of the shows were ironic on the top, which I think was either a bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad scenario. I did not laugh once during the duration of the film. All the jokes were old references to current events that would surely lose their strength over time. Indeed, the highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the White Rabbit was on his way to meet Alice, but the result was a bad tradition of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would say that turning the croquet game into a rave dance was terrible. Was undoubtedly the low point in the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not see this movie. After it ended I was really angry.
