If you enjoy seeing what should have started as a two-hour film in unrelated bursts of dislike, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you'll just wonder how they can make such a movie from something very simple to translate into a big screen like the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the previews of the movie, many of the scenes that were shown were not shown in the film, and inside the film, some scenes are meaningless. While the film is a little less than an hour and a half, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, before or during the credits directly! <br /> <br />
