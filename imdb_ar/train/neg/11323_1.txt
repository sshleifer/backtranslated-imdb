This film will enhance your mind. read a book! It's unbelievable that anyone who thinks this movie is worth the time and investment to do. I've seen "B" movies before but the film "C" was invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers because my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for videos 15 minutes from Knights. Production in secondary schools is better than this and the actors concerned should erase this from their curriculum vitae. Critical is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. So that my roommate, who likes these kinds of movies, turned it off. Now I must tell you something really. If you watch this movie, like him, I will pray for you.
