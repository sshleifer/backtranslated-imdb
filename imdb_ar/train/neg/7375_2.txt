This film strongly influenced the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as Stephen must say boring! As before, Seagal is either too good or too stupid to rename his lines, leaving someone who hides his voice for the footage in which the sound needs to be repeated. A few movies ago this had done it too, but I do not think so! To be honest that the movie looks good, the text can use some work but parts of this movie look like a real movie! Of course, tell us that this movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> Segal would have been better if Sigal had not become a cartoon to himself. Do not care. Anything more than a buck for this one is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and Seagal. What took me a long time to achieve it?
