I managed to sneak in one night and go to the movie theater to watch this night, believing I was on a therapeutic trip. Boy, I was wrong. Considering the talent involved, this must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Everyone in it was wrong, and I find it incredible to read on this site that there are people who really liked it.
