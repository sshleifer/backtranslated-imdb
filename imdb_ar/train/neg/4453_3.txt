I'm sure that people who watch this step outside the British movie will be an amusing hour, but for someone from the UK, it is painful because of his mistakes. <br /> <br /> Directly at the beginning of the movie, Elijah Wood gets off the tube at the bank station, which has been littering. "What happened here," he told his sister, who answered, "Tottenham was in town yesterday!" Tottenham is already in town. They are part of the city, and they do not have to go there! If Tottenham fans want to fight other fans in the last place on earth, they will do so at the bank station, where security cameras are more likely to be than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> Mistakes But the biggest drawback for me is the actor who plays the naughty role. He clearly decided that it was not useful to try to speak East End, and instead chose a fake style on Dick Van Dyke's style which led to my ears bleeding. The fact that the rest of his gang have spoken the way they expect West Ham fans to speak has been confirmed. This mistake made it incredible in the role and really spoiled the film.
