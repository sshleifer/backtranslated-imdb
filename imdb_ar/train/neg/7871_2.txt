In 1993, "visitors" was a huge blow in France. Therefore, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ever. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not fulfill its promises. In fact, it is supposed to tell one story. Jean Reno must go in the 20th century and restore Christian Clavier in the Middle Ages so that time can follow his natural course. The problem is that Clavier is very comfortable in the world of the twentieth century, so make it back to the Middle Ages rather difficult ... Instead, the film goes on in several other stories without succeeding in pursuing the main theme. Plot. As a result, the film sometimes becomes sluggish, sometimes a mess. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier are in the trap they can avoid in the first film: they outperform the top and become annoying. So why did Jean-Marie Bouyard co-director Muriel Robin participate in the main female role? I made a mistake because it looked uncomfortable and felt pathetic at all. The other actors are not the best: Marie Anne Chazell non-existent and Christian Pogo, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film has good moments with effective masks but is often in the vulgarity and ease. Certain dialog boxes and dialog boxes are affected. It also seems hollow because Poir√© retrieves the elements that ensured the success of the first film. Thus, a young girl takes Renault from a relative close to her family and asks him to participate in her wedding. <br /> <br /> A strenuous and disappointing follow-up. Anyway, what is the benefit of this commercial film otherwise? <br /> <br />
