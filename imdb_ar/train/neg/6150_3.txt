I saw this film in order not to like it. I certainly do not. It is one of those films that seem to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music around the film almost in almost every single frame, almost indestructible, set in a long time ago, toned images of dark brown, grainy, no sex, He explains everything he thinks and concludes with sfx / cgi until we get him (stupid audience). The only thing that made fun of me was the fact that they spelled NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead they call the Nobel price (named after a real person named Alfred Nobel) the "noble price" .. Jesus! How one can commit such a mistake in such a great production, is supposed to be based on a true story. what a shame! What were you and others thinking about?
