First seen on 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King, a vampire-like movie, has so many weird and silly elements that you start to laugh at the weirdness of the 3/4 movie while you wonder Whether this movie may have worship worship for King fans. It is the story of the mother and her son who sleep (like changing cats, eat meat, need life, near an extinct strain of humans) who move from one town to another in search of virgins to continue their lives. They are encountered by ordinary people of the upper class, except that they are secret lovers and the cats huddle outside their home, day and night. Cats are fatal to them, so they put traps in their yard to try to keep the population down. We see them breaking some necks when they attack (which is also the first in my film experience) - I hope that no real cats will be harmed by making the film. The boy after the sweet girl has a crush until he turns into a "sleeper" and then wants her body. There is so much uniqueness to this film that it might be better if it were a full-blown comedy about suburban life, but the director tries instead to scare you every few minutes until you hope Gore will beat him. In the end it happens and the film ends until Stephen King is a pessimistic model. The movie is interesting because Humor King comes from more than usual but his love is also very present and what you have is a movie his fans may love and have to have in their collection, but as a worthwhile film experience, I do not really cut it.
