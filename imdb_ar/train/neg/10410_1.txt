This is a chaotic and incoherent mess of endless scenes of monologues and monologues. This is not an exaggeration: you have to make an enormous effort even to try to get involved with him. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believed that Vassbender would do something interesting to find out why the Irwin / Elvira suicide was finally done. Instead, someone in each scene tries to explain: "When he was young, this happened. "And" just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything there ... ", etc. Soon in the film, Erwin / Elvira in a slaughterhouse talking to a prostitute friend (certainly the slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the life story of Elvira, Fassbinder shows killing a single cow One after the other. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what a transsexual says. Of course, we came to the very rough and rudimentary symbol of "I have suffered so much in my life, and I am about to die." <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments in which something happens, Erwin / Elvera encounters a former lover, that only after the design of the very gay dances with two other players (as if going to the necessary level of homosexuality ) Is that he recognizes Elvira. <br /> <br /> I must confess (as the nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything is lost in the film because of Vasbender's indulgence in himself.
