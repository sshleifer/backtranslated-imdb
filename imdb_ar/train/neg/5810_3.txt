The spoilers through: <br /> <br /> Gaitaway is often a action film. And what work there for !! Shoot, chases, landfills and much more. Starring Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin as Mack Quiz. <br /> <br /> This is a new version and I have not seen the original but I have not cared about it at all, although Basinger and Baldwin have a beautiful chemistry screen. But the film itself did not do that for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway has become really very tired. The plot crashed with a fight / chase after another and as the violence continued to build up, Basinger and Baldwin maintained their superb appearance regardless of the risks they might face. In fact, at the end of the film they almost look at the best and then at first. I do not think the Bassenger makeup of the eye moves once throughout the entire picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I have ever seen, certainly not, but it is not very good and unless someone is a pure action film I can not really enjoy this movie because there is not much here. Gettaway is also not terribly original, moving in all ways from unnecessary brutality to somewhat boring. I thought it was really better to think. <br /> <br /> Basinger and Baldwin offer good performances, but they do not have much to do except chase and run for their lives. Sometimes it is less, after seeing the same thing again and again, it becomes old. I did not enjoy this one for much.
