When I borrowed this movie from a friend (luckily I did not buy it) the package (which looked really bad and ugly) was printed "Final Vampire Horror". After watching it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting and sound and everything reminds me of my first attempt to shoot a video of the 10-year-old VHS-system holiday if not worse. The film was given 2 out of 10 and only because the promotional shirts looked fantastic. I do not want to work as "film students" or generally vulgar movies, but I saw Braindead and watched a movie costing $ 20 of students was ten times better than this nonsense.
