If a film deserves a big fat rating, it is a heap of nonsense. I love zombie movies and even bad movies usually have something that happens to them but not this brutal act. I started to get angry while watching this movie because it is too poor, I can not believe that those responsible actually believe that this is acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy and the plot is cut with scenes of sadism and beatings. People do not react or behave or resemble humans in any way. The entire film is also filmed in two slightly decorated rooms to resemble places that are supposed to be mysterious. The whole thing is one meaningless mess, do not go anywhere, and when the zombie finally appears it looks like garbage and does not do much. <br /> <br /> I can make a better film than this, so you could as well as a person who has never seen a movie before. It is regrettable and undoubtedly the worst film ever. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's the worst film ever. You will notice by the way that only positive ratings give this 10/10 and urge you to purchase a DVD. I can not imagine anyone neutral thinking really that it was a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 This is a generosity.
