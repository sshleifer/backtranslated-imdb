Carlo Fredon once succeeded in combining brilliant comedy with brilliant social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and turned into another "boring" exit than "you". <br /> <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be summed up one way or another in one line: "The working class = nice and warm, while the upper layer = volatile and dazzling, but love wins in the end." <br /> <br /> A vulgar cliche of such a clever director. <br /> <br /> There is not much to talk about in the film. Every character is a stereotype of walking: the man who made himself himself and who forgets his roots but will become "good" again, sarcastic wife, rich rebellious girl falling on the honest but poor man ... representation is barely average. <br /> <br /> Disappointingly under each side.
