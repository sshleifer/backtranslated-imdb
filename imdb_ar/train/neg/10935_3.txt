I have never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being Mormon, I always felt that humor was very exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a group of obsession. I hope this is the fresh air, the Halestorm film that I was finally able to discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I figured that because this was a B list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson, and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it should be funny at least. Besides, the church basketball has become mature with a lot of gay gags. But I must say, throughout the entire film, it seemed as if no one knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat, ignoring every chance to really funny silences. The dialogue was nice, and the film had some of the worst personal developments I have ever seen. Every person other than Wilson was less than a dimension. It's hard to believe that after nine rewrites of the film, the film was still in his mind like the wreckage of the train I saw. I can not put the words of anger I felt sitting in this. I and my friends were add-ons in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, Utah. Director Kurt Hale was there, and I must say, I avoided all communication with him after the show. Wait at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film had not only torn off an hour and a half of my life, but left a painful scar that I would never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the specific problems I encountered: there was a small sub-plot of love story between the doorman and the fat pianist, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and it was impossible to pay attention to them, so I and my friends kept asking why it was Supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting people. There were many sub plots that appeared from time to time, each one preparing the audience with the chance to laugh, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke, and ended before she could even start caring. This was pretty much what the entire film felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great disappointment, and I feel bad for anyone expecting the first real funny Mormon movie. True, jokes in this one are not very exclusive to Mormons. Then again, it was hard to find out what was a joke and what was a sensation in my ear. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Consider the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. Avoid yourself the disappointment you have experienced
