It was worth sitting through this terrifying "movie", just to know that I could never experience anything as bad as this again. - 0, Scenario 0, Backstage - 0, male - 0 (Bob Cheddar eight miles as a polite war hero gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (she is a wonderful actress and not a terrible actress). These are standards that I used to average to two. I lost my account but I think that the film's cliche, at all, is in this film. When the driver who killed her father, who is supposed to miraculously, eventually appears to be competing against her, from outside the scene, the previous statement reinforces. Plus it appears only for no reason. Not mentioned before. I do not know what to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a few years. At least this way, some of them will be released for commercials.
