Men's radar from the moon is a very typical fare of 1950's serials. Special effects are very cheap, and obviously the Moon Rovers are surplus SUVs in World War II with plywood coated on them, and the like. Representation is just what to do. It inspires the imagination of children who I think this is addressed to them. According to today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a huge amount of inventory footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
