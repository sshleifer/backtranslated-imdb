The former private security guard, who has turned his eye on his last unmanned job, is given an opportunity to return to his former career. His mission: to polish a mysterious French woman who recently arrived in California ... seems to be wanted by clothes rackets and tie. A failed attempt to update a noir movie type, without having enough sting or intelligence (or involving the dynamics of the plot) in the scenario. The director and scriptwriter Paul Magwood (who later claimed the photo was edited without his involvement) does not come out with an impression of his great appreciation of Chandler's 1940s; his nostalgia is appropriately harassed, but also bitter and somewhat indifferent. The way to deal with curiosity is curiosity and praise, and Warren Oates is great because this kind of 1970 is a "special cock", but the film does not contain any footage. It's nice to see Leslie Karon and Gloria Graham in the cast - though there's not much to do, and Karon's hot and cold personality provokes anger all the time. A vibrant cinematography of Alan Stensvold, a beautifully photographed photographer, but fails to reach any kind of boiling. * 1/2 of ****
