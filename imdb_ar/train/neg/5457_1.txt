A representative asks, "What is my motivation?" , To understand his personality. After watching this "docudrama", this mysterious and random farce, the viewer wonders about the motives of anyone. <br /> <br /> This ineffectual offspring of the daytime television (Opera Show) missed a great opportunity to explore the miles of issues of importance. <br /> <br /> Her characters were all shallow and superficial, and her story line was much less social than the Simpsons episode. Police unjustifiably portrayed the investigation as unprofessional and incompetent. She failed to show why the court dealt with the main character, a child-nanny, in a way different from that of the male. <br /> <br /> Why did this uncooperative woman start a second grade student, starting an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade? Why did the boy's mother on her behalf? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, in addition to generational rationalization and greed. The film gave no hint of it. <br /> <br /> Why did not the viewer know that the victim's mother sold interview rights to print and television newspapers, and showed her teenage son on "The Today Show"? After taking advantage of Mary Kay's lawyer, she reverted herself to the "Son of Sam" law so she could capitalize on her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder? <br /> <br /> Why did not Lauturno's father explain this? Was he a former member of the right-wing Republican Party, the independent American presidential candidate in 1972, and the president of the John Birch Society? In 1983, the political career of John Schmitz ended when he discovered that he had children by a university student of his own, and was only revealed when that mistress sexually abused her infant son. Yet, his father removed his many children from "very liberal" Catholic schools and struggled to prevent all pupils from receiving any sex education? <br /> <br /> A month after her parole, she is now pregnant again at the age of 14. Second-year-old daughter, Mary Kay received 7 1/2 years in prison because of numerous violations under observation. After that, a prophetic editorial about the sad issue appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two hours, LeTourneau was taken to prison, and this brilliant thrill of television shyness ended, until the dumping began." <br /> <br /> Certainly, 18 months later, this farce was being portrayed.
