As a physics student, I became familiar with many idiot teachers, and other so-called experts, in this area. As I continue my studies, I learn more and more about the real physics experiments going on, and about people who do things right. <br /> <br /> Then, my friends told me about this "physical film" you wanted to see. I do not know anything about it, I am excited, hoping that the information will be presented well. <br /> <br /> I did the real quantum mechanics, it was not. <br /> <br /> This film starts with the basic assumption that anything that happens to an atomic particle can happen to you and will happen, if you only open your eyes. Let's think about it, for just a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies from somewhere around 10 ^ 30 make up such subatomic particles. This is a million billion billion particles! The "mysterious" quantum effects of two molecules can only have a 50% probability of canceling each other completely. When adding more particles to the mixture, it becomes almost impossible to obtain a large net amount result. To tell us to believe that this is a true assumption, without rationality behind it ... it is just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, as well as in physics, calculated 3 facts during this film. But they were presented in the most misleading way I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say that for the nervous part of the film, as I did not get any medical training. It seemed like he might have a little more truth, he remembers my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least, this film had a wonderful quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. Do not destroy the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to a wedding where you see all kinds of different characters "driven" by the peptides. Then the movie moves to the dance hall, where people are divided dancing, sometimes surrounded by peptides CG, and the whole CG scene, full of dance peptides. The film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we were "addicted to feelings", so we treated the full song to the amazing success song, "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene was revolting, because anyone can pass through this scene, and still takes this film seriously ... Well, you need to "open your eyes".
