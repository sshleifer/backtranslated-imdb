First of all, this is a film with a low budget, so my expectations were incredibly low to enter it. I suppose most of the people looking for this movie wanted to just shed blood, and that's all. <br /> <br /> A conspiracy? There really is nothing. It is mainly saw but in China the whole hell is much worse. cast? No, this period. special effects? Awful at all in my opinion ... there were arrests and the blood was often unbelievable because of the quantities, stains, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I think the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal, shocking film. It now has great potential for a larger budget, but poor scripting, bad dialogue, terrible representation, what looks like video footage of the camcorder, and just an incredible Gore make this movie so bad. <br /> <br /> Movies are worth the risk of some reviews. Even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (bloodstains, for example, were the latest I've seen for reviews that deserved it), but that was simply bad. I hope that people who think about this film will read and decide on my comment. <br /> <br /> I am all for the sake of brutality and shock, but unrealistic realism and truly terrifying behavior make a terrible experience. Save your time, your money and the chance of something else, you will not be disappointed.
