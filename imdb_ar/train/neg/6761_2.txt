Let's be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this film is surprisingly interesting. As something to be released on a DVD to an innocent viewer, it is a poorly produced product. If I change channels and accidentally watch this movie, it's likely to catch my eye and catch my eye for a while. As someone who bought a DVD under the impression that I would get a suitable film product, a film, I was very disappointed. It's a television drama recorded on video, something like the old 1960s series, but without that particular magic. Apart from the lead man Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either chapters of the campus (very old for that) or members of the director's family who appear in front of the camera without any help, But also from the make-up artist or hairdresser (the hood over the growing standing bangs or the top hat on the mullet is a very long way of creating the 1840s). It is filmed entirely using a motionless camera in a small, bare studio, and sometimes uses a blue screen for external backgrounds. The blending is inspired by a lame "period" inspired by romantic karaoke, which has been insulting viewers' ears on more than one occasion. The film tries to be "dreamlike," while in fact it is just an uncommon combination of those shots that led to the editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to begin with). There are interesting dialogs from time to time, but in general, they are very lame and produce two-dimensional in more than one way without any flash of genius from the manager or any of the crew members. This is how "technical" films tried to search in the 1980s. Mr. Redfield does a much better job than the actor.
