I watched this movie two weeks ago at the new Japon Photo Festival in Paris. Although I did not expect much from him, I must say I was just as disappointed as a lot of people in the audience ... If you want to summarize what I felt, I said I compare it to Princess Mononoke and nausea from start to finish. Of course it's silly. But I could not help. The stories are quite different, but the depicted worlds are very similar. From this point of view, the "palm tree" certainly can not compare Miyazaki's main works. Even if it is technically good, the boredom remains ... In the end, a complete lack of authenticity makes me advise you not to watch it. I've worth 2 out of 10 (a little stiff, I think it's worth 3 or 4)
