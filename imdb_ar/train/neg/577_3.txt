First of all, John Bon Jovi does not appear in the Vampire film. Along with other non-interesting characters and bad story the whole film becomes predictable. If you keep that in mind and you are a fan of vampire movies in full, you can enjoy some sights. Do not expect any Tarantino-style chapters here nor Ann Rice's story. (I expect to have forgotten the entire film by tomorrow;)
