F, bare brothers band. what should I say. I think I can say this show just sucks. Number One: They have no talent, and maybe they can not even play instruments. # 2: In the ad, they said they were famous, but none of them even heard a crappy show. Look, I really do not hate her so badly, I would give her like 4 out of 10, but what bothers me is how everyone says they have such great talent and that Nat is very deep and writes deep words. Deep my ass! Talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, read what you say on the walls of the bathroom will be more profound than that. They were not famous themselves. Their parents were famous and famous and wanted to be their children as well, so they did a bad job. I have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.
