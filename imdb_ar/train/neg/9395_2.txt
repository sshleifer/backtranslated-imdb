This series is interesting to watch as a MST3K feature, but to the public today this is all it is. I was really surprised to see the year in 1952. Given that this fact alone makes it solid (low?) 2 in my book. Used cars do not look contemporary, they look like things from the 1930s. In any case, she is a Cody in her nipple suit against Grapper and Dali To Domenechs who practice guns and launch beautiful lame ray guns in their own right, And enjoy. If you want to watch a really good series, see Flash Gordan, it's full of missiles that attack each other, good evil enemies and also good-looking women, and that does not represent anything of this. Flash has been created 15 years ago or so of this nonsense so you can give it some slack. Something made in 1952, this is bad, worth 2. Nuff said. Give it 6 If you watch it as a MST3K episode, these guys enjoy some fun with it; a tablet of nipples here, a tablet there and I fly! Now, as an added bonus, the Commander Cody Theme song originally coined by Joel and two of his robots, Tom Servo and Crow, were brought to you on the Love Moon for Episode 8: The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the beginning of credit) ; <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) The code of your commander commander .... He is the new personality of the Republic, <br /> <br /> He gets every week problem ... but was Save him by editing, <br /> <br /> Only in spite of his nipples ... sends her on his way, <br /> <br /> The head of a racket and a rocket package .. .. will save this day, (JOEL SINGING), his laboratory is a boxing ring ... When mixed young men come together, /> <br /> Some people always have access to our service. .. and the code he has to fix it, <br /> <br /> The wine drinks the tea in the AL Cafe ... and flies along the wires, <br /> <br /> It beats the crows and flies with the hooks ... And shoots forest forests, <br /> <br /> (Crow singing) <br /> <br /> BAD GUYS Beware ... CODE THERE, <br /> <br /> YOU Like his hair Under his leadership Helmut ... And because we can not think of a good rhythm, this is the end of the code in this song ... So, sit back with the granite, > <br /> Watch chapter VIII, causing the planet to be the enemy
