I feel less honored with this film than others like him. Crazy people are always portrayed in this century with being so strange that they are of different species. Their alienations are so outrageous that they are completely fictional. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or they have charm with chickens. They are about to beat or each other. It seems as if the screenwriter said, "What can I compensate for, without feeling mad or even mental illness?" See the wonderful humanitarian picture in "One Fly Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where the diseases are reasonable and real. She once worked at the State Mental Hospital. I have not seen any of these men. This is a very smart account to make them come into life.
