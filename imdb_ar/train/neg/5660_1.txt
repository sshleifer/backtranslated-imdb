I am happy to read a lot of negative comments about the Tritter conspiracy. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They love the cruel nature of the house and its intelligence, but they really hate the constant criticism. It is limited to the true nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry with the police authority. She must have a more caring nature rather than take revenge on everyone in the hospital. Also, there seem to be many questionable legal aspects about what Tritter is already doing. Can not alone freeze accounts and has the authority to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions to patients. Much of his mystery is hurting patients with the disease in the hospital, which is not a good story to photograph. I have voted for the terrible incident, not because of the story itself, but when I insert a Trittor piece, it quits me and hurts the rest of the plot, people say they hate watching story lines anymore. Other please. Get the Tritter out.
