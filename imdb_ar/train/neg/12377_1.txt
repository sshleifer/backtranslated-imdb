Just because a person under 10 does not mean that he is stupid. If your child likes this movie, it is best for you to test it. I am constantly amazed that many people can be involved in something that turns out to be very bad. This "movie" is a display of a digital processor and nothing else. Writing is awful. I can not remember when I heard this bad dialogue. The songs go beyond miserable. The representation is substandard but then the actors have not given much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatton? He can not sing and he is as ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the clarity of everything. It seems as though the writers are going to make everything as stupid as possible. The great children's movies are sinister, intelligent and full of intelligence - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Winca and The Witches to remember the past two. But in the case of the continued collapse of the Americans, more people are pouring in for exploration, such as Finding Nemo, the modern Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, and crossbred trash such as Red Riding Hood.
