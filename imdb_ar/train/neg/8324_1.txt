First of all, the so-called big players must have the money ... The surgical scenes were laughable ... and certainly they should know that people who have little knowledge of medicine will find this very ridiculous ... Do not leave The room during the heart transplant .... as it does not carry out surgery in a small room free of tools and equipment heart and lung and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... can not focus on the line of the story because of all the stupid surgical scenes ... no blood , No staff, then comes hero hero and takes over ... It is not a film to think about adults .... The budget must be limited The street scenes were fine but it was the technical advisor .... It seems he was directed by a complete idiot .. Save your money and wait until you come out on a DVD and do not hire ..
