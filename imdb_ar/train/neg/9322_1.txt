Please do not let the cover of this film fool you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie you laugh at: That's not it. I usually go to stupid if it's funny, but that stupid guy was so stupid (or maybe he did) that made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The movie quality is better than a portable device, but not much, and it is quite possible to create music by pressing the Samba 2 key on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be a deterrent to watching a horror film, but add this amazing actor (cry), and you have a real moisturizer. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a man who invites him to invite his friends to the family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He is also invited to crush his mistress in his office. On the way there, she meets a woman in distress, then is invited to come by other girls. <br /> <br /> Cabin accommodations include sex and nudity, and soon everyone's panties become in a group when one girl disappears and the alien items appear at home. <br /> <br /> From there, you (the audience) and the Muslims, or the actors, are trying to figure out what is going on and are soon starting to mistrust each other. Overall I think I made it look better than it is. The main conflict with this film is that the characters are too backward, the plot is fabricated, the bad deeds and the ignorant motives. Again, this could be forgiving because it was the least funny thing but unfortunately, it was not. <br /> <br /> The twisted end is only a twist where no one can guess it simply because if you really thought about going back the movie would not make sense anyway. Please do not let this review stop you from seeing the impressive storytelling of this movie. (Woah, my nose grew only eight inches.)
