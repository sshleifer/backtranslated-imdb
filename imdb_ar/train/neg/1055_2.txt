* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First of all, you rated this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are a lot of stupid mistakes in the film, where I failed to make it a drama Which may be. First of all, they are not fighting alone. After very strange initial doubts of her mother (which is unbelievable when the mother proves that she is supportive and later love the film) rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> It is also an incredible naive to always fall into the traps of alien crew. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The thing I find most believable is that Ethan failed to control the crew when he changed his mind. It seems that people think that the other guy is joking, but when Ethan changes his mind, he does not succeed in persuading only one person in the crew that he is right and that his former boyfriend is wrong. Everyone simply hates ... why? The film does not provide any explanation. How to become a leader? <br /> <br /> Funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... In a cheap way to get viewers?
