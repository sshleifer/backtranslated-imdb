While the original version stares at the mind, this new cheap version of the Sensitivity Shock was designed. Instead of complex moves, this dramatic story is characterized only by sudden and random changes in the story that only lead to further deletions with each strange twist. Worst of all, the replacement of the original hot dialogue is an upside-down salted player filled with four-letter words, leaving behind a stinging but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - an unrealistic promise. Michael Kane's graduation certificate from Patty Duke like Keller to Sullivan is interesting. Unfortunately, this illustrious and respectable actor has only eroded his reputation, first by accepting the role in this nonsense, which has been badly rewritten and then by performing performance that seems only efficient compared to the excessive hyperbole of amateurs. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the classic version, keep your photos and games dated. Catch and watch and enjoy only a story and a half. For the new edition, convey this insult to the original.
