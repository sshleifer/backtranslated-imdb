Curly films are often seen as derivative, repetitive and non-original. I happened to be a fan of horror movies, but this film was so bad, words fail me. The script is badly lacking, the plot is silly, acting very badly. Just stinky all round, to waste time in my life. This was all the entertainment value of a 15 sequel to a movie which was awesome in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who illuminated this mess? <br /> <br /> I just liked two things in this movie. I had a killer mask - which was nice. The second is the Austrian rapprochement with profanity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself, and avoid this heinous mess.
