(There are spoilers) take care of Mia, Carrie and Woehrer, a murder whore committing a murder, a 18-year-old virgin life, although he is very embarrassed to admit, college student Trent Colbert, Christophfer Ryan. At the end of the film, Mia not only reduced the displaced, but gave Trent the poor and naive innocents a lesson on how to discover a serious job in the nut and keep it away for him or her, in order to prevent him from turning to the end. <br /> <br /> Mia was suspended by Roy, Bert Young, commenting on the truck driver's rest, to do some warm and heavy activities in the back seat of the buggy. Rui either drunk or too stupid to realize that Mia is not another then his daughter scattered! Angry that Mia is reluctant to confront her, Rui almost suffocates her to death just for first year student Trent Colbert, who is heading to the other side of the area to beat a truck driver. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance, Mia jumps into the Trent car and the two in what seems to be the strangest car chase ever in a movie. By moving across the northeastern United States of America, he ended up being involved in a truck, breaking a murder and shooting with state troops that then led to Trent's parents' house where they were taken hostage. There, there is an exchange between Crazy Mia and the entire SWAT team, reinforced by local police and state forces. <br /> <br /> You expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be unintentionally funny or unintentional, but it is not. In fact, the film is very annoying in how Mia treats everyone in the film on her contact even with her father Randy and the child. Getting Trent to drive around the northeast makes Mia drunk drunk drunk while in the hotel room, along with whips cuffs candles and a lit candle. Mia also gets him with Mr. Foster's horny hotel owner by tricking him to give her his weapon, as part of a strange sex toy. After taking off from Foster, she takes off with Trent, who comes out of the cold in his motel room, and costs about $ 400.00, but does not bother to drive. <br /> <br /> The need for money to pay for gas to get a home for his parents, where Thanksgiving Thanksgiving receives a call on his cell phone from Mia to receive it from a local dinner to recoup his money. Like Trent's jerk, he picks up Mia, who is now running away from his law, and then gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway while trying to run Trent and Mia off the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this abandoned house, chased by Roy Mia, running in a muddy way in the high heels, and escorted with him to get what he knows with a blast from his own gun house. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he forgot to leave the gun unchecked. <br /> <br /> With both manslaughter and murder, as well as beatings and escape, the two are accused of being caught in the S & M / Tattoo shop where Trent trenches his ear, nose and clothing in leather and chains, by Miri, His white collar and his salary. This is in order to meet his parents respectively, and the Governor of Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> After an exchange of fire with the state forces, with one of them seriously injured, the runaway of the law ends in his parents from Mr. Trent and Mrs. Colbert and David Keith and Ellen Martin at home with the entire local police force, Waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> A terrible film with a really annoying final ending made you wonder what exactly the film was trying, anyway, to tell it to be an audience. I felt a lot of empathy with Miya at first, but with the film continuing its optimistic end that evaporated quickly like a pack of ice cubes in the Valley of Death. Although Roy was the most undesirable person in the film initially by the time he finished the film Mia completely lost.
