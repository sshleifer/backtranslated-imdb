This is just a joke for a film. I've already lost the opening scene (Spoilerwarning). A dangerous creature kills another creature in its cage. A scientist works there on a screen and guesses what you do. Well let's go into the cage to check things. They came in the same way as jumping in a fish tank with a big white shark because they ate a golden fish ... very useless, even more stupid and I will not even talk about the cast because they do not deserve this effort. Why did not they shoot the guy who immediately wrote that puzzle for me ... This kind of numbness continues the entire film. The only good thing is that CGI is the best and then mediocre for these low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If these things do not bother you, make sure to warn you if your IQ is higher than 60 people might hate it.
