This movie has been shown repeatedly on the cable recently, so .. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women to fight for either Luke Wilson or the "villain" who has holes in this film. The female actresses are very nice and this is the only reason to watch this movie. I think it's "funny" that Luke's ugly / big / stupid friend is nearby, but well, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> No female leaders will speak at all, do not talk to any male in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is an illusion of weeping, weeping, fighting, and so on. More than two young men were better described on Friday the thirteenth of the fourth. Dead * @ $ #
