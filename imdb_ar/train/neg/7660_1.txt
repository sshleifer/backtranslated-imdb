Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorf, Frank C. Turner, Matthew Walker, and Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game manager's attempt, Uwe Boll is trying to re-create the game to become nude with sadness because it did not work. Instead, make one of the worst movies ever! Although he has a rare fame, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorf, his film lacks the necessary fundamentals that the film needs to be as good as the storyline and some basic relativity of what happens in the dark and light. The movie thrives everywhere and Uwe Boll has no creative control. Not to mention the bad CGI used to make monsters. Although it looked cool and the food was good, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever. My final rating is 0/10.
