This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says that the acting is wonderful and the wonderful casting is never seen even in modest cinema. Representation is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel that all other "high" comments should have been made by people associated with filmmakers. I was not very impressed with the story, but I just wanted to see some beautiful rural areas in Oregon, and there was some decent film work - but the film was inspired by anything. I think this film also makes fun of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in American Indian culture has been ignored, perhaps lost, and that its revival is useful and possible. It puts jokes in the wrong places and makes it very clear that I think it was written by the State Department or anything. Return to the drawing board. Even the suggestion that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of the classics as Harold and Mood, is completely backward, and on the same line begging, pretending and "joking" as is rampant in this film.
