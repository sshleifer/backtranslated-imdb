I have given "Kôhî jikô" a low score not because it was a bad film, but because it does nothing commendable. <br /> <br /> I have never seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before, but for beginners (including myself) Kôhî jikô was announced as a tribute to Yasujiro Ouzu. (A Japanese director was his last film on the road, 1962) The film is a very sparse work ... contains very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" a jobless person, a scouring figure who spends her time at her local coffee shop or checks loose with a Taiwanese author who loves her. Tadanobo Asano plays the role of her friend, who works in a CD store and sometimes indulges in his attention to the Otaku in trains. That's it. <br /> <br /> Watching while Yoko drinks his coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for the train ... catching the train ... sleeping on the train. This mundane reality that anyone in Japan can see daily. Hui captures these ordinary moments from the lives of these characters, but without any meaning to these short essays, it is a futile film made or seen.
