You know when you are on the bus and someone decides to tell you the story of his life, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face while all you really want to do is slap the asshole and go out? Well, I had a similar feeling while watching this movie. Well, I actually chose to go and see Aprile, and I knew the taste of Nanny Moretti in making it the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last installment of his memoirs I wanted to give Moreti Madre of all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny and unusual, and at least two other people managed to get a word in an easy way. But in Aprile, Moretti enjoys the exclusive rights of dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-level whine about how his best policies, or what a strange piece of popular culture tickles his imagination at the moment. He also finds time to give up films he does not like, something I thought was dedicated to losers like me. Sure, in a location like his, you think he'll try to get a little smarter about cinema. Through the production of a possibly appropriate film, containing some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps not controlled by his completely disturbing voice. When he began to hang on to his new baby, I just wanted to go along with an ordinary person, preferably not being a particularly obsessed director with a strange tendency to attract music. The next time someone you do not know tells you his life story, give him a slap. Each strike will be a small victory in the war against the Mauritanian.
