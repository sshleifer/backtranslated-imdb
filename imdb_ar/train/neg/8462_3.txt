"Bullfighter" was released in 2000, but was released on video after 5 years for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: a confusing story, an incomprehensible dialogue that Oliver Martinez said, and the annoying editing? It must be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jack (Oliver Martinez) on an underground ground trip. Meet many strange characters and avoid some evil characters as well. The film looks great and there is a lot of elegance, but there is no content. Most films do not try to draw attention to themselves through unplanned plot developments and weak private effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Dafoe casts it for two minutes. mostly.
