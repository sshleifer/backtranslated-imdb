This is pretty much the first film by Jason Scott I have seen. I say a lot, because I also saw the soldier, where he plays the role of the villain ... but what I heard, is not a film of Jason Scott Lee. This, however, is. If this indicates the quality of such films, I will not see any of the other movies. Lee is basically accepted as a martial arts artist ... as a leader, he is terrible. He fights a nameless random battle every few minutes of the film, perhaps because the screenwriter could not figure out how to extend the film to the minimum required for the time of the feature film. The villain is the only character with a personal hint, and regardless of the fact that he is crazy, it hardly seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is me chasing the villain over time ... or maybe it is the opposite. I can not say for sure ... I will definitely not see it again to be sure. The effects are not quite awful ... but they are close by. The title comes from the common idea of ​​using the time machine to go and kill Hitler. In a way, the film also spoils this interesting idea. The plot is very complex in its favor. Poor speed. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this film ... I can not really do that. It is simply very equation and useless. If I have a timeline, you'll be able to go back and prevent this movie ever ... No, it does not matter I just hope that as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to my fans, not to anyone else. If you're looking for a good movie ... well, that's not it. Certainly. 10/01
