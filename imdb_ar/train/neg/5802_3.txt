Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" was again filmed and shown on domestic video in the United States via Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who has to observe the body of the witch with his faith only to protect him. It has been greatly expanded and set in America, although it has been clearly portrayed in Russia (homes, clothing and furniture are all wrong despite English tags), this strange film does not really work. The part of it is a strange environment trying very hard to be a jungle in America but obviously it is not. There are also some strange and deliberate moments deliberately since the main character is to be a reporter at first and a priest shortly thereafter. I'm not sure why they do this, even after watching making a piece on a DVD) and the other problem is dubbing that goes beyond terrible. This place has been done so that everyone speaks when their lips are not on a camera - or if the sounds do not match even with the lip plates. I do not know whether Faith Films fault or wrong producers who made the film hoping to sneak into the West (it was revealed in the industry piece). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I said, it contains all kinds of technical problems that make this antiquity artifacts. Despite some good-looking horror pictures, the movie never works as a horror film. As a film that generates faith, it is very confused in this novel to make anyone feel that anyone is closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I'll give it a pass, even at the bargain price. My advice is to find a 1960 version of the story called Viy that will bring some shivers and some understanding about faith in God.
