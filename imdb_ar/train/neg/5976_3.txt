Rumors are true: girls like UGLY COYOTE more than men. The reasons are obvious once the plot is given. Girl Jersey Go to New York to become an audio writer. After initial frustration for lack of luck, some girls heard the concerts about $ 300 each made last night. They get the audition in the tape they work in and surprise! The place is full of two-year-olds who explode when children are dancing. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are likable, especially Kami (the "fashion coordinator" part was nice) and the guard but let's face it, the drama was absolutely awesome and ridiculous from the start. Violet and her father looked very silly as they communicated throughout the film. Check out the loud blur on this keyboard using the dancer's palette! <br /> <br /> For the first time I can think about it, how can production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this film, Hollywood was able to stand on its feet and show a new low without any great public anger without saying, "You've been warned!" Instead, COYOTE UGLY seems to have a purposeful intention to try kissing every major back in the world. Advertising kids in a bar, but showing a thin sheet "follow your dream" disappointed every male teenager who targeted them! <br /> <br /> Finally, music. There was never any interruption to the music I found in this film, especially when needed (hospital scene). Each scene feels like some short music videos that you just want to stop until the bar opens. But its climax was finally laughable: like the 1980s, you'd expect Cyndi Lauper to jump into the theater and get busy with Violet. Heck, personally I thought Bon Jovi was about to jump with long hair and jam too! <br /> <br /> Unlike some smart cameras that really work with wolves when you dance (especially the wet scene), a couple of cute cliches, UGLY Koyut is something to be quite embarrassing. Whether you saw it or made it, it seemed like killing time. Or wasted depending on how you look at it.
