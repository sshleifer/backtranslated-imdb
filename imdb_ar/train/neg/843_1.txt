BDSM serves Los Angeles culture as a backdrop to this low-budget, built-in mess, and is simply a piece of vanity for its best-paying operators, Celia Xavier, who also produces and performs in a double role as sister sisters Vanessa and Cilia. A question soon arises as to whether some non-temperamental cameras, lighting and firework editing can reach a point of contact with a weak and incoherent narrative that is often not taken seriously by the viewer. Celia is used as a highly motivated surveillance officer in Los Angeles County, while her evil twin has become a prominent figure in her pagan world largely because of the dramatic performances on CDs, but when the disaster of Vanessa's Mistress begins, Celia begins to look for her sister's attacker The villain, a new job as a "slave of sex" in the Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a "cell concert". Two FBI agents (ostensibly posted in the Vanessa case because of their involvement in BDSM sites) and the Los Angeles police murder detective were appointed to investigate the crime while trying to provide security for Cilia, whose spirited performance in her career The new customers consider them eagerly to create conditions of personal danger to them. There are many flaws in logic and continuity, such as intentional homicide assigned to the Office of Operations at L.A.P.D. , An area in the capital far from the venue of the film. The direction is not centered and is not helped by the wrong editing after production and reproduction of sound. The photographic gymnastics is crowned by Montage Bati near the end of the film for the previous film, which refers to the scenario in a concrete way. A solid analog role emerges between this malice: Stan Abby as an enthusiastic FBI agent.
