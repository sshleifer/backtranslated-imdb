"Handsome men with bad haircuts!" "Beautiful girls without any evidence !!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot straight!" From the Dragon Dynasty, gang drama comes in Hong Kong "Dragon Hit". For reasons that are likely to be completely obscure forever, the production and appeal of the movie "Offenders on Doping" somehow made both Maggie Q and Michael Bean sign as bad guys. But they do not do everything they can in this terrible clown. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors around them, each with his own biography and list of achievements, and in particular she has the courage to do some difficult and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Qee was the super bad Mai in Live Free Or Die Hard, said Nuff. /> <br /> Biehn, of course, is best known for being the soldier of the future who made "The Terminator" 1984 such a fantastic science fiction / fantasy, by the clash against Big Arnold, who is now the governor of California! <br /> <br /> Michael Pine is almost completely lost in the wreckage of the dramatic drama train. There is no reason at all, because the incredibly complex plot - mostly presented in Chinese, as in Hong Kong - could have been better developed for non-Chinese audiences with the foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Behn has been used as something like an observer or Interpol coordinator, or an agent under a deep cover, who needs to get some sparkle every five or ten minutes, that would be great. But no, it has been brought as part of a strange group of bad-type Special Forces who seem to be working for themselves on a rotten deal, in the middle of a completely corrupt person's deal involving the local king of corrupt deals. <br /> <br /> Yes, there, I said everything. Confused ? I also. "Welcome to the concert,". <br /> <br /> In a truly brilliant crime drama in Hong Kong, known in English as "Breaking News", there are also a number of brilliant characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bad guys versus the good cops. In this brutal and overly violent invasion of the Hong Kong band or banditry, the police forces shot at it seem to be nothing more than a show of a duck in an exhibition of shooting, the way criminals do. <br /> <br /> So it is not surprising that there is a totally incomprehensible scene (many scenes, in fact), where children try to shoot the wooden ducks in the card game, to win the stuffed animal prizes. The police officers then intervene very well on their behalf, so that the owner of the corridors must abandon the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also a heart attack to create a "love of interest" between a "visiting policeman" and the "visiting policeman." <br /> <br /> Visiting police are supposed to be material witnesses Against the bandit leader Triad, who is kidnapped on his way to his country to appear in court, but not by his own team but by mercenaries (Bien, Maggie, and some others.) All these killers want something but we do not know what it is, even It was a stupid mistake in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You can not provoke a thriller in a criminal drama without getting something, getting it or getting away from it, It is an early stage in the story. <br /> <br /> Add to this some "intermittent scenes" made for purely artistic influences, which all show the bad bad guys and regular ordinary bad guys, and any buff movie can easily understand why this dog The carpenter got one rating from this admirer of all the movie stuff with criminals, conspirators and Hong Kong.
