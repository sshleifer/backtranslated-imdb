"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films with strong performance that are sometimes noticeable and high points, but unfortunately they are broken down and slowed down largely because of a mysterious plot and do not care about the public much. Starred by Richard Widmark as a doctor working in a mental institution whose life is in turmoil due to family problems, an amazing conflict and a great deal of fatigue. It really seems that there is not much at all. <br /> <br /> The plot is feasible. It is time for the institution to get new curtains for library windows. An old woman wants to put curtains on her, but many patients want to make their clothes. In a way, this cynical and unintentional conflict explodes to the point where lives are threatened and families begin to collapse. It looks like a conflict between very young children. <br /> <br /> The question about the logic of this plot and whether it can really happen is so huge that one wonders if there is a real crazy person that can happen. Buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with acting. The team that follows Widmark is composed of other great actors, many of whom are Oscar winners and winners. There is sometimes a moment in the film succeeding brilliantly, but it always ruled out the stupid conspiracy around window blinds. Unfortunately, there are a lot around the narrow curtains, so the film slows down. A lot of time-consuming actions are implemented from the perspective of a single camera, adhering to slow speed and lack of viewing attention. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized film and it becomes clear to viewers what to do once the focus is on the plot, which happens very quickly. In fact, it does not seem very fun to watch, and I tell you it's not fun watching it.
