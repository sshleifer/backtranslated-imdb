No wonder this was released directly on the DVD here in Australia, and there are no features to recover what has ever happened. It was a hokey dialogue, acting, awful and absorbing script! Whatever thought it would be a good idea to do the sequel or follow-up to John Padham's far superior film, the Wargames of the 80s, also must have been on something because they were a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at caring for love / sweets, while Matt Lanter was as good as the other main driver around him. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code For anyone, check out hackers or the original Wargames movie - both better than this piece of crap !!
