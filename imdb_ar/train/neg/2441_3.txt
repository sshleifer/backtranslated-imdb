I thought the "intensive care" was too bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it is somewhat disturbing, but it is never shocking. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment is: Koen Wauters was stabbed and beaten by the killer. He groans in the corner of the gallery. Amy (Nada van Nie) knelt beside him and asked, "Poor Peter, will I get help from a gang?" <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in Dutch and English. To cover costs, all license plates are from USA, and the background in the newsroom is the Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and watch the original in Dutch.
