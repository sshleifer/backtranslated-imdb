Too bad no animals nor Eddie Murphy has what he says worth saying. This movie is very nice. <br /> <br /> A movie for children? Well, if you're trying to get them to take a nap, maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some animation of the lips with an amazing animal code to joking that is not funny. The sync of the lips makes old Godzilla films look brilliantly compared. In the meantime, Eddie Pluto Nash planes are using Murphy jets to provide them with a painful and painful cost of experience. Apparently, he is trying to modify his old obsession, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967 is lost in this re-visualization, or whatever. A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. Later. Pluto Nash can be taken aback by them. A series of things along with some senseless jokes to an uninspiring conclusion with no surprises. <br /> <br /> Renting the movie '67. Or some old Yogi Bear animation.
