I have seen this at the Venice Film Festival, and I can not make a decision on it. We have never been allowed to get close enough to any of the characters you care about. Maybe that was the point, we were all in our own "bubble", but these people did not force me to worry about them or shock them about their different destinies. At a time of just over one hour, the characters were not well developed. A lot of time has been allocated to photograph the plant equipment (forklifts, conveyors, shovels); baby dolls look a little creepy with amazingly lifelike eyes, most of the characters made for a living were more interesting in some way than people. An interesting experience, but somehow it never gathered.
