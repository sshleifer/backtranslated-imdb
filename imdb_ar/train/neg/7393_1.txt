I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, maybe weigh as much as we weigh, even though I do not have the confidence in the street for a ponytail. After being biased and passionate about America's favorite stage and screen hero, it's hard to say that this is his worst film ever. I'm not sure he is capable of producing a worse film. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problems in this film seem to occur in the post-production phase. It is painfully clear that this film was supposed to have a different story. This results in disturbing sounds in which Steve's voice does not coincide with the sound of Madbalij. Editing is weak, and this will generally start badly, and it gets worse, and in the end you'll want to have a Da Vinci code review instead. Yes, that's bad. <br /> <br /> After that, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends are still laughing at me to listen to his CDs. Is it time to start verifying some Van Damme records to DVD records directly? If you are tempted to watch this movie, remove your clips and throw them in the toilet. Darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
