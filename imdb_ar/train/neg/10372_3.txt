I enjoyed commenting much more than I did in the film when I saw it in a second theater in the early 1980s. I was then touched by the care taken to create fashion-style closely after the Tenell drawings. But to me, the cast was largely wasted, their characters were chiseled by masks, while the direction I think is unusually fixed, mysterious photography. The classification listed at the time was meaningless, meaning "not worth sitting even once". <br /> <br /> However, I will also jump on the opportunity to take a second look.
