I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, so I convinced my wife that it was a "unique horror film". I wanted to like this film, but I could not. <br /> <br /> The Love Story was good, but the horror side was so bad. If the story is about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from Parasomnia, it would have been better to have a better film. <br /> <br /> The care center extended to a great deal of credibility, in fact it was very ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores the privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse goes to a room for routine feeding of a serious patient (without security guard), falls down the stairs and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and villain of the film) is tied in a fully coated condom - for years it seems? None of this makes sense. <br /> <br /> The film had some actors that I liked about other things, like mabahith, but I still can not recommend this film.
