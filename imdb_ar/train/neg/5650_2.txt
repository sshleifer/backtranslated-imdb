William Schattner in small doses is acceptable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor annoyance, and somewhat amusing, he found it appropriate to expand and bypass his role. As in the original Star Trek series. I think I will never understand American humor, which often trumps the "message delivery". I will vote with my feet. I no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the staff were good. It is unfortunate that the role of Schattner overload, affects the performance of James Spider. But the majority shows how society is going, I think. I do not travel on the same roads. explicit
