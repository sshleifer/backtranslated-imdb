:: Potential spoilers :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was awful. A Catholic / mythical / teaser movie that runs on the ground from previous films. <br /> <br /> The priest is doubtful. Sex and priesthood. Politics and religion. Hypocrisy of the Church. The plot involves the church. Dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo fight between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty dumb and lame with a weak story enough. The story revolves around two concepts: forgiveness, known as the sacrament of purity - the last rights a person can ask to cleanse one's sins on the brink of death; expulsion, the act of separating a person from the church. Basically, the executor can not get forgiveness. This is how the eater comes in sin, and I will leave it at this point. Throw away all the narcotic stuff you have already mentioned and have "The Order". <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene with the priest intertwined with footage of the Virgin Mary instead of insulting the Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger (rephrased): "I am the Savior and the curse of sins, I live on it without love without Blah Blah blah" / Cue walks in a dark alley with a long coat alla "The Matrix". <br /> <br /> This film was given a single film because it is not only crappy and not original but also because it managed to insult the whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
