Turn your back away or you will face a big problem through "my girlfriend"! Only the happy ending can flourish in your innocence full of depression and death at the very moment you see it. It is safe to say that the whole film is collapsing, with a sarcastic style and a tribute to the zombie that shows that it defies nonsense to the extreme. We get a name like "Johnny" often, and this "Johnny" has no place to go. There is no specific reason for a "dead corpse" to crawl out of his grave just to stay until the night of the prom, making the film useless. Without feeling sad, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he has died. Johnny takes a bite of Eddie's arm after that. The viewer is asked a difficult question: Why should the film be this handball game? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all people living or dead is purely coincidental. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing in common with the film. Show this to your girlfriend and you will skip the big prom and turn your life into an abandoned ruin. Blah !!!
