I hated this show when I was a kid. It was on the day that the children showed that the characters were dialects in fact, and not just the American tone we used to. Jack Wild was a British accent and Pufnstuf was in the south. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I did not quite understand what the deal was with the witch who wanted the flute. It was always strange to me, maybe because the flute bothered me and I did not have any trouble to take it! <br /> <br /> Just comment on the resemblance Pufnstuf with the early seventies of the last century business mentioned by others: McFunstuf Pufnstuf separated. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the television show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonald's characters to show them, but when McDonald's refused, the television program changed the characters slightly and passed them on as their own. They even hired former employees of the McDonald's advertising agency and the voice actors to deliver television programs. McDonald sued and won. Look for a lawsuit in McDonald's Pufnstuf and you will find many articles on the subject.
