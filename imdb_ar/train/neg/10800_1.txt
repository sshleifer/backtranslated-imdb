What was the purpose of this film? What was the plot? I do not know. Can not hard to act, people do not know how to run me, I Kazam! Genie Who Rap? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember I watched this just to kill time. It was not really my interest. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shack in this movie ???" The whole story also sounded stupid. It makes no sense at all. I think one of the unethical ethics of this film is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything that can happen. I can not comment any more because this is a terrible film and there is nothing worth commenting on. I "wish" that this movie would go away.
