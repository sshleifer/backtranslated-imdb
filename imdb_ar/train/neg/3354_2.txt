In my opinion that when you decide to reproduce a very good movie, you should strive to achieve the best of the original. Or at least give it a new perspective. Now Robert Weis's 1963 novel of Shirley Jackson's brilliant novel The Hunting Hill House deserves the price of admission today. Now quickly forward to 1999 and re-made. I shook my head and asked me, Why? Wooden Representation, The Unrecognizable Story It seems that the whole point is to replace the hidden horror of the original with many special effects that computers can generate. I have heard that this update was bad; but I could not believe it was so bad, given the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and telling my wife how awful she was, she said. "Well, they got your money!" It's right, do not let them get you. If there is no profit in making bad reps, they may stop making them or reach a higher level that does not offend their audience
