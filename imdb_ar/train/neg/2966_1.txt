I can not understand all the hype about this film. Well, if you like syphilis, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not see this. I personally did not strongly like the actors in this movie, and apparently they were hired directly from the street. The dialog boxes are completely flat and always know what will happen next. The overall quality of this film lacks a very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and three other people) we all took into consideration that this movie was made by some people who need to do this, just to get their graduation in a film school - with minimal effort. Another problem that really reduces the whole experience is the poor camera (loud vibration) and the bad sound, and the whole movie seems to be restored by one microphone.
