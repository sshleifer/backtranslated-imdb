Using the footage looted from Planet of Dinosaurs, this video clip (with the exception of stolen footage) relates to a group of people who were captured in space and who landed on a dinosaur planet ... Do not wait for it, it is truly a land. In a five minute drawing stretched to 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another movie in the Bad Movie Police series) - Having felt homesick with good stolen effects, this film is still impossible to reach. I have been left to think about the question: Have we become so creative that we are now plundering old films not only for the plot but also for mismatched footage? It is clear that low-budget producers are so desperate that they will give us anything to take our money
