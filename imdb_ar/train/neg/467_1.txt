There are bad movies, awesome movies, even boring movies ... I can watch most of them and put them to the end, not this time. Avoid this like plague, annoying music all over, terrible editing, no comedy, more pressing than grandma mug ... My Miss wanted to watch this belief that it would be a blonde substance or something legal of water, but not better than Average, chick flick. It was the first time she had begged to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, well, it was not nice to start with Denise done OK in infantry and wild things but you sank in gravel. I feel like I've spent 30 minutes in this ... Pamela Anderson is almost indistinguishable after much of the construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting oxygen and valuable brain cells screaming at the absolute flesh that is on the screen.
