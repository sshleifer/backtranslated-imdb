If John Waters wrote "House of 1000 Corpses" after repeatedly hitting his head with a heavy instrument, the result might be something like "The Blood Shed." It is moderately amusing for the first half of an hour, but it slides into a kind of outstanding gloss of constant screaming and people doing things with other genitals using electric carving knives, knives and pliers. Susann Adrensen is incredibly annoying, and Terry West (Elvis Bolion) is very bad at everything he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it will not take most viewers a long time to forget.
