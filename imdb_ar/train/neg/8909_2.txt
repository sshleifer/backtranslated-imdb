This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot is meaningless. Some scientists working on the fringes of science open the door to another one (perhaps hell?) And suck his daughter through him or anything, then one day for no apparent reason, she now has two large breasts and wears tights (I think the demons in The main character is the man who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is obviously gay more interested in her new friend, and stumble upon this charming spelling book (they want to be witches or something ???) and ends the evil evil mantra Again, it is how the evil devil comes to earth, where he can not stop A girl's upper bikini and a man who refuses to love. There are naked scenes without a reason and a man in which my friend says he is a well-known wrestler but his role is absolutely unnecessary, obviously they did something just to put him in because he might actually encourage wrestlers to watch this senseless film. I'm sure the nude girls do not hurt there. The additional features on the DVD were more confusing than the rest of the film, and I think it might help explain what is happening but actually make things more confusing. Who are these people and what do they do? Basically, this is a movie that goes to the camp and fights, but there is more to it than to being confusing. I did not like the movie but it was like five dollars too big. I would not recommend watching it even though it was so stupid, I can not think which part of the film was good.
