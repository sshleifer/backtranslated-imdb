There are so many very talented directors and actors in Germany now. None of them is associated with this "film". <br /> <br /> Why in the world are producers really investing money in something like this? You could make 10 good movies with this trash budget! It's not fun to have seven grown men running like pygmies, pretending to laugh. But the funny thing is that the film producer (who happened to be the oldest man in the group) plays the role of YOUNGEST dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with moments of screaming for comment, saying you should laugh now! It's hard to believe that this foolishness is supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes after the movie. I should have done the same thing instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
