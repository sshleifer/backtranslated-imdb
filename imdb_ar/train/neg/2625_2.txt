This film acts terribly, written, existing and product. But it is very difficult, it is in fact almost semi-circumstantial. This is a SEMI scene. <br /> <br /> The story of the story (few of it) makes no sense at all. The character of Barney Drum is the only real comic satisfaction in the film that tire after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian supporting actors can be found in television commercials. None of them have moved to anything else I know. Of course, the brother of Slay Stallone less well-talented ..... = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was almost entirely filmed in and around the small village of Claremont. (About 20 miles northeast of Toronto) I met many local attractions / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed in "Oshawa Drive-in" which was now demolished just before it was demolished.
