Maybe this was made because of his hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, and the best thing about the entire DVD would be the case !!! I'm surprised that people took time to make something out of garbage and after spending money on it too, I'm glad I'm just a tenant. I assume that the true fans of this film may have to be sadists and goths who care about it without being involved in any CGI or any other influences. I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future, Still works. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers, this is very disappointing, do not buy it!
