It's a weird movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends, it can give you a deadly laugh. Strange comes to mind again and again. Amateur shot, acted worse, directions, maybe nothing. The special effects are funny but the music accompanying the baby demon bird will certainly be the most successful. See it if you have time to kill. But no, do not even try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to "pornographic holocaust",. Since I have not seen it, it is a tribute I can assume is bad. I should have given it a 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets 3. Gore excessive, the only thing that someone did. Stay away if you are too sensitive, more daring than laughing. I wonder if the makers of laughter make it?
