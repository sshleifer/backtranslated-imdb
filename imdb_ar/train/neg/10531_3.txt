This is a kind of music, which means you love or do not like 1950s music. If you do, you'll love this. I personally am better than the 1930s and most of the "1940s" music with the dancing talents of Aster and Rogers, Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Robbie Keller, James Kenny, Shirley Temple, etc., but the songs of the fifties, slower dancing numbers and melodramas soap all over the decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is an example. The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. By that time, the story had no great appeal, either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus.

There are similarities in the musical R & H. Thus, if you like Julie Andrews flick, you should love this as well. <br /> <br /> This is a huge production with, yes, capital "L."

"Yul Brynner is the classic" King Mongkut ", the filmmakers always portray in a negative way, not" progressive, "such as the left wings like the saying, but the teacher Kerr (Anna Leonowens) Today secular progressors place higher teachers than people who are trying to treat cancer! However, Jules is good at this role and even employs some comedy along with his character more than the bark. In this film "The Magnificent Seven," Yul was the only cowboy who dazzled the audience. <br /> <br /> In short, he is an elephant M is great for his day, and millions have enjoyed it.
