I did not know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. This was a really terrible film. The film scenario, direction and representation were very bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could have made a smart and thought-provoking film, but he did not. I pressed in my seat for the last half of the film because it was so bad. Where was the focus on the film? Where was anything in this film? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. This has been done in a harmful and wasteful way for my money. Do not see this movie.
