There are only two films I would like to give 1/10, this foul smell and "The Man Who Fell on Earth". I remember seeing the protocol in a theater in the early 1980s when I was in high school. The script is offensive to anyone (including a high school student). I completely lost it with the "giggly" gag that someone fired on the fire. Goldie Hoon is supposed to be a witch but she comes across Bape and Moro. Then there are stereotypical stereotypes of the Arabs, followed by Goldie, who wins all over the sorcery. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hoon. I could not stand to see another movie that was in it until IMO regained itself in everyone who says I love you. This is the type of movie you create if you do not want to make any effort in writing the script. the worst.
