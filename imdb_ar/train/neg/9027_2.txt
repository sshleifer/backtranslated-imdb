Revenge of us watching the audience maybe. I sat in this two-hour film, and I was waiting for the second film to start showing his film. But Costner never took revenge on the fate of her fans who died and the film ends. I left wondering where the rest of the film was. If there's a movie called Revenge, it's better for the hero to get some of it by the end of the film. I had a choice to see this or Black Rain in the cinema, thankfully I saw other film brothers in cinema instead. There was one good thing about the film and its theme was beautiful. Listen to cd.dont watch this awful. 1 out of 10
