What an awesome movie. Do not get me wrong, because Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from some interesting pieces, the film is often filmed with hysterical submarines screaming, crying, sweating and generally fearful when something goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's take this aside from simplification to make sure that the public still understands what is happening (the scene in which Denzel explains to the radio reformer how to be like Scottie in Star Trek is no more than a joke) Well worth acting. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that the real US Navy is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
