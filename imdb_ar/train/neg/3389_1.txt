I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway knowing God several times and felt the passion, despair and joy that comes from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine a "chorus" of the screen but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came out of the offer is stymied, this should answer your question. There are some presentations that are simply made to be viewed directly - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough finished the musical work of Gandhi and the dance with the animals in the film "Doctor Dolittle" in directing this film, which has little resemblance to the play. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), And wonderful songs were dropped or given to other characters (which were not logical). Michael Douglas was indecent Try the people who could not dance acting There was a woman "Landers" erotic that could not sing or act or dance - I think she has just finished becoming Ghandi's wife. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances do not seem more than just a novel of "Flashdance" that rejects and nothing works. I sat there amazed at how a very passionate passionate thing could be drained. If you really love this show and will go back to Broadway in 2006 - watch it but do not think that the long musical event that was the "Cours Line" has absolutely nothing to do with this film.
