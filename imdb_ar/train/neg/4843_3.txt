Well, I've also heard you read all the reviews and comments that are not yet implemented about how this movie deserves the best Oscar, so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from members of the US military who served in Iraq the likelihood of the events of this film. They reflected my own thoughts; while playing the movie - full civil - I kept thinking about myself, "Say what? There is no way that can happen like this." 2) There is very little that actually happens in terms of the plot. A new bomb disposal man appears to replace someone who has been killed (a death that has not been clearly explained). The new man gets the rush of adrenaline from his work. His position puts others at risk. This is! 3) This film is not anywhere near the suspect as claimed. If you want to thrill, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally strong, try hiring the Go Tell The Spartans, which revolves around the Vietnam War, and the stars Burt Lancaster (who told me personally in a wonderful Supermark interview that it was a movie he was very proud of and one of his best , Which was still displeased, was largely ignored in the aftermath of the end of the world in the extreme limit), or the old classic black and white Sink The Bismark, which, especially for the English film, is incredible heart. Do not waste your time on Hurt Locker.
