I just do not get some great sites for this episode - Miranda is so wonderful, and that there's nothing very ugly that makes you crazy. Someone here made the statement that perhaps the frequency of light waves or something rather than being a heap. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and very fun. I also do not quite understand why Colos was an ambassador, so why not leave the union and the damned Medusans residents? There is one part I like, when Colos talks through Spock about the unity of human experience. In general, I love the TOS, and even at best, I'll always be right. This episode - mmm, I will not buy except for a used version of less than $ 3.
