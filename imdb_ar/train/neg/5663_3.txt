This is for Zatoichi films because "Star Trek" films were "Star Trek" - but in this case each of the original versions was more enjoyable and enjoyable than this big shiny game, and it was also made better if the material was more important than the surface. If I had not seen them before, I would have thought of this beautiful but empty look because I thought his style was inappropriate and his content was inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the personality in a larger and larger production must look good, but there was no meaning other than the hope of making money; it was simply a show, often failing to capture the personality world and failing entirely in taking the personality anywhere that did not exist (Also, the actor was not at his best). I was hoping to see Aichi at a later stage of life, in a story that would gracefully see him and draw some conclusions from his experience in general; it only reworks pieces and pieces from other films, savoring more sexual violence and violence. Not the same experience at all.
