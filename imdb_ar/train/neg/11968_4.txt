This is just Bruce Willis, a schtick film movement. Watch it with some popcorn and friends. You can rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skirt talking to Willis of Dick the carrier? What's up with that? He can not do that from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W is suffering from a sickle wound. There is a range of medium explosions. <br /> <br /> If this film represents "sea seals" accurately, do not stumble in Africa and expect them to come to save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack in the village bothered me more. "Seats in the front row for ethnic cleansing" ... while Bruce looks at the ongoing carnage in the city. So what does he do? He crawls into the city on his stomach. Yeah. How many died while they were roaming? Well ... I think there is a need for a physical count. <br /> <br /> If this African man is very important, why did not the helicopter hunt with the elderly and the children? Could you say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. Not only in the plot, but a lot happens at night, it was hard to determine what was going on. <br /> <br /> He rented it.
