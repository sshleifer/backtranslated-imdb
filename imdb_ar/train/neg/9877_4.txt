Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wies Anderson directs and takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full-length movie. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, did, the film seemed to have lost its smart spirit. It seems that Anderson has left the story behind him knowing that he is a talented man, and if this is a bad film, it will be his first bad film. Just as you go to school and spend your bad first day, this is Anderson's first bad day in filmmaking, so I'll let him out easily. I will admit that it was cleverly visited and a nice soul, nice animation, but the film is gradually difficult to enter, leaving the story behind him and random shots of random things happening. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman is impressed by his intelligent son, George Clooney, ashes, and in particular by participation. The film does not make it up to the level of awe, but it certainly comes closer and closer with its advance. I'm sure that Wes Anderson will return to the track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a big disappointment.
