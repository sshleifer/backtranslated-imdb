This is one of those films that you see from an academic perspective more interesting than the perspective of entertainment. I classify it based on how much I enjoyed the movie or enjoyed it, so I give it 4. If I classify it as an academic film, however, you'll get 10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Elements of sound effects and realistic. It is supposed to convey the memory of disjointed and fragmented mind, and that it is interesting in these respects. <br /> <br /> However, the film contains a lot of disgusting elements because I did not find it all amusing. They're basically just annoying. Contains some very interesting erotic images too, some interesting concepts, but some personal relationships (especially between mother and son) are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will either appeal to you or not. For me, it was fun from an academic perspective, but it was not a good hour, and I might not go back to it again. <br /> <br /> 4/10 If you are looking to entertain. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
