This movie was well advertised. I'm thirsty for movies and have watched previews of this film for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this film would be in fact, my friends thought it would be wonderful and I was scared of it. Then I went and saw him, planted in my seat almost asleep until I remembered I paid for this movie. I laughed at most things in the movie just so I did not feel upset and spoiled the good mood that I was in, plus I wanted to get paid from the movie! I always go to a movie with an open mind, I do not try to enter it with many expectations, but this film was not funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have watched many of the movie's premieres or liked slow and tedious comedies you may enjoy them, but for true comedy fans. Maybe check out the kings of comics again. I was told something to see "Know Parents" !!!
