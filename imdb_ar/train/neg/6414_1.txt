This is the worst part of cr4p I have ever seen. It hardly made sense. It was not scary at all (unless classified as scary as loud noise and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gillard needs to stop with these horror movies. I think everyone in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits expired. <br /> <br /> In the list of worst films I have ever made, this is how you will go: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> < The reason I made Silent Hill 3rd because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was cr4p at all. The same with cabin fever, meaningless, but the return topped that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Kapin Fever put together
