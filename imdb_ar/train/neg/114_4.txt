It's not cast. The finest group of actors, you can not find. It has no setup. The director loves New York City, and at the end of the film, are we all! Woody Allen was unable to improve what Bogodonovic did here. If you fall in love, or find love, the Manhattan is the place for you. No, the problem in the film is the script. There is no. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In Hollywood's own director's experience, that's what happens when they go to work in the group. It is a reality for him and his friends, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film hollow, shallow, less message.
