Alfred Jellinek, not a common name yet, is the Nobel Prize laureate for literature. Her film was born with a second prize at the Cannes Film Festival and high prizes for male and female shows. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so threatened that anything goes well? <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, gobble' is the preferred spelling representation in Britain for the bubble noise caused by Turkey. In the cinema world, turkeys are very volatile, measured by box office receipts or cash receipts. "Gobble, gobble" and The Piano Teacher are ideal partners. <br /> <br /> This embarrassing film can not be overestimated. It starts very badly, as if it disturbs the viewer. Intersection credits unimportant scenes for more than 11 minutes. We have identified Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the changing ego of the beloved author, and the rocky piano professor. She lives with her mother, a climber and strong. My father is a crazy man institutionalized and dies invisible during the event up. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, along with recording his hatred. What we see in the film (and perhaps we read it in the book, to my knowledge) is a comic, exploitative and illogical story of an emotional pendulum swinging here and there without continuing. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name appears at the very least, is initially a person with intense musical sensitivity but is completely suppressed. Not quite, since there are two hand bags in place with Maman's loud appearance early ending with a heavy apology. If the references (yawns) draw a maniac (why not use a phony word when you do a simpler word), it will be your violent mood for Elrika. <br /> <br /> A large piece of young Walter, taught becoming a low-voltage engineer, whatever it is, playing ice hockey in a few leisure moments, is also a talented piano player. Elrika encounters an old concert in a luxury apartment in Paris that may or may not be. Like so many works of art, it immediately falls in love and starts in "la la femme cherchez". <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika has a desire for explicit pornography, which appears briefly but graphically for a few seconds inhale a tissue taken from the waste bin in the private wing where you see it. <br /> <br /> Walter is a wonderful experience and reluctantly accepts her as a special student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by distance, hostility, frustration and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declared his love and long before Erica followed the ladies where he engaged in oral sex refreshing and unfinished by mouth. Erika retained control of her evil fetus. She promised to send him a letter of instruction for more cheerful exchanges. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, you feel jealous and chilling because of Walter's kindness to the nervous student who literally suffers from exercise before rehearsing for some future concerts, Erika pockets the student's coat with broken glass, causing severe ruptures of the hands to play Sensitive piano. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (passing female genital mutilation, etc.) led to the emergence of Walter in sharing the apartment Erika with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliating, restrained, patient, etc. Sensible Walter is, for now, repelled and walks at night. <br /> <br /> At this point, there is still almost an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika Walter tracks the ice skating rink. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the traction hand on his pants. The "broth of children" will be expelled soon with other contents in the stomach. Be marginalized. <br /> <br /> Walter, a drug addict, may have wanted revenge for the newly thorny insult to the ground, to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what is happening now? It's not too deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a beast while Erika becomes a victim. At one point, Maman was locked in her room and slapped Erika, and the next time he kicked her in the face, fucked with her and renewed the statements of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair to this summary? Watch the movie if you like, but I advise you not to do so. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if it is in a proper mood. I can expatriates portray the challenge of human relations that this film has conveyed if you like. But I prefer not to do so, because this is a cheap film and bad for the instincts and does not say anything. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to say that Erika, who is repressed in a friendly way, longs for love, seeks ineffectively in pornography, rejects it inappropriately when he literally appears, and realizes the pink color and palpitations, under her nose, she does not like to Hurt, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world, for reasons not explained, stopped. She seems to be making a beast of a superficially loving person - but surely we all know that any man is likely to be violent, because this is his basic nature no matter how he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have patience for your existence, there is a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she is supposed to play the role of substitute for a student who taints the underwear with worn hands, Erika carries a knife in her handbag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. She has stabbed herself in a region and lives that are not life-threatening. Roller credits. <br /> <br /> If this won the second prize at the Cannes Festival, how bad is the rest of the posts?
