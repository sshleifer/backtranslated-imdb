Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the original story of Cylon. The supply hypothesis is interesting. However, the authors follow a lot of story lines and fill them with too many POV characters so they can not tell stories. The plot creeps at icy speeds that dissipate the tension that may be. In any particular episode, little happens or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Grayston (Eric Stools) is a military contractor working on a human soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only prototype is the motive behind Amnesty International's copy of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing by soldiers from a single group, a homogenous underground group. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Joseph Adama (father of the commander of Star Wars Galactica Adama) struggles to hold his family together while searching for an AI version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica Strongly similar to Chicago 1930). <br /> <br /> In addition to obscene writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem like many original stories. We already know how it ends (that is, the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
