This animated image comes straight from a dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company acquired fame and fortune during the first half of the 1990s through the production of horror films. The most famous disasters in their areas are "sub-species", "seeds" and "scammers". Neither of these nor the doctor is recommended Mordrid, in fact. The hyperactivity director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Murdered is stupid and surprisingly amazing and almost soulless. I just saw it because it was stars of Jeffrey Combs. I learned that he can have many flaws if you are a loved one. For every good film, it seems to make 5 bad movies. However, the story revolves around the battle between two ancient archaeologists. One good one here 150 years ago to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and the evil one named Kapal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason he has already forgotten. Combs get his instructions from a mentor. This "man" exists only from a pair of eyes in space. Very cheesy too, that is! The blinding lightflash is occasionally displayed on the screen, but this relates to the only form of special effects of the film. The whole thing is just a bit of whining and shaking and when the two sides finally face each other, it's over before you know it ... I was expecting the wicked wizard to respond a bit, but nooooooo .. .. In some scenes, you can really discover some originality and creativity ( Such as Jeffrey's lecture on the impact of the moon on criminals). If you are really interested, you may find some very small but nice aspects (such as the crow), but in general, it's a waste of time and terrible energy. I'm a fan of Jeffrey and he may be a fantastic hero in my eyes ... but he certainly does not have to put May on it.
