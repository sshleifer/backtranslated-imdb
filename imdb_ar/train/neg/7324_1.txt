As a film graduate, I would like to think that I have seen a variety of films, some good and some bad, but I must say that Summer Rain is the worst film I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that a classic would be a great Britain like "Secrets and Lies" or "Lokstock", but it was not so bad that my classmates ended up laughing and expressing hilarious acting and cheesy text (reminding me of bad theater production in schools). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to bother us from the start. Michelle, the main character who lives with her friends, has a kind of face that will never tire of him. My neighbor was very wet (a shadow that breaks my tears every 5 minutes) so that at the end of the film I did not give a damn about either. All I thought was, "I paid 3 pounds for this pile." I did not write any reviews before, but after watching this film, it prompted me to warn people of this disastrous production. So please avoid at any price. Thanks for reading.
