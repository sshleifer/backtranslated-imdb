A vulgar cliche about imminent divorce - or is it? - Through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. A vulgar dialogue, cardboard figures, stock cases, a sub-plot of the red herring coma, and worst of all, there is no return at all, whether emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> No one knows creative writing any more? The true mark of weak storytellers - when you can not create any kind of satisfactory satisfaction - just quit the story. I have to ask, "What made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place?" <br /> <br /> Well, but lost, debuted by actor Anthony de Marco - the rest of the actors were, at best, forgotten. They ask why no one is watching independent movies! These are ninety minutes of my life and I will never go back to it.
