This comes from someone who has almost no offer. Representation and sound are awful. This may be eligible for a "very bad" credit point, for some. However, I take my horror movies seriously, and this is just nonsense, it's very cheap, I think these are my main complaints. The dialogue is often joyous - it is the number of times you use "I was surprised". The actress "The Child" is seriously an awful god - I pray that her career ends by being represented here ... where the line "DONUTS! I DATE DONUTS" deserves frequent viewing.
