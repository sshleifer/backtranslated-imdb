All the funny things in this sitcom are based on the fact that the main character Jim is either a bad father or a bad or selfish husband in general. How can that be funny? Of course there must be a personality error in the sitcom, but Jim's character is flawed in a way that is very sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Why? I think the reason is that "he should now be better." Jim is not stupid, he can take care of things and has the opportunity to do so. But he chose not to. It's a conscious choice, when he chooses not to play with his children, not to go shopping because he does not want to buy "lady products", an option he does, when he takes away his relatives. <br /> <br /> It seems that the other characters are only in the series, so Jim can have someone to be upset. If Cheryl was a real person, she would have left him for years, and would not stay with this deadly person for eight years. But unfortunately, it is just an incentive for the extreme selfishness of the middle class.
