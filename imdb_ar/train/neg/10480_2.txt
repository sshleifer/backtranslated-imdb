In fact, you may find it in the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie funny but then the story moves from one side to another with no specific reason and you can not understand what It occurs until the work finishes. <br /> <br /> However, the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) describe him as an actor, but I do not think the way he does it is anything but exaggeration! .... Period. The little boy who plays his son has no sense of acting and I think it was just an interest he did or something because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason while they thought that by casting comedians, they could do it, but they did not! Sometimes the cheap, tasteless humor is very bad, and I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But hopefully this is a bad thing. To make people accept these DVDs to the general taste, they will have to give them some food, and that may work. <br /> <br /> Maka
