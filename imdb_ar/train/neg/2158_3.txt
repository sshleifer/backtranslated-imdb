I can see clearly now why Robin Hood fluttered quickly. Perhaps the first episode of it is the worst ever broadcast by the BBC. The opening scenes were as strong, meaningful and intelligent as two fighting monkeys. Robin Hood had no character, and the sword battle was funny. The worst part of this episode is Robin Hood, who was wearing some of the make-up dresses at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? no one. This series may have improved significantly since then, but this first episode quickly dropped people's hopes, which is basically a pile of cr * p. The great champion of England has been insulted. <br /> <br /> "Do you tolerate this?" I will not do that for sure, unless the BBC begins to understand what a wise investment is. 10/03
