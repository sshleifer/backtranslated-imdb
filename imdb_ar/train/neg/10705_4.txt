Maverick cop suffers from family problems and nostalgia using his gun ?? Check! Insulated site with precious object begging to be stolen? Check! Yummy looking love interest? Check! Variety band of villains Cannon Dodder Cartoon dumb with European dodgy accents? Check! German seems to be a bad man played by an English actor with a piece of comfortable dialogue in every occasion ?? Check! One horny blanket? Check! <br /> <br /> Dear, does this movie take the first week or so? Clichés come thick and fast like collapse and most defenders are standing around tampering over how dangerous the script is! <br /> <br /> In a direct, quick and joyful way directly to Die Hard's video clip just on a mountain (complemented by some of the lines drawn from the above), we have all the usual procedures that divide cliches gradually as we go along with some old violence nudity And good thrown to wake anyone in the audience may just be shaking his head. <br /> <br /> Jack Wilde is the cop in John McLean's position here, who runs the time so that the old bad guy in Venice used all the bullet holes in one point. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this mess, there are some well known known faces that I can only assume they need money and / or I simply play for laughter directly from the senseless opening scene which has nothing to do with the plot Absolutely the final inconclusive conclusion is complete with the ruby ​​dialogue and even ruby ​​evey cts. <br /> <br /> If we look at this third question of the SMP effort on IMDb, I was surprised when I found that this worm produced only two series, and I have to find these gems on DVD! It seems that the first sequel is the Rip of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, Know Good! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with each film, and the character's name seems to change for the third batch. <br /> <br /> However, blind purchases of cheap DVDs will not be the same if the studios do not keep the material in such terrible quality !!
