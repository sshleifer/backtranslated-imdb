Well, it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and a lot of disappointment. I can see where the filmmakers came from and they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not quite different from each other, that the individuals were lost in the fighting, etc., etc. (Well, this is a default, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. this kind of movies was bored of me. I've seen a lot of really long films, but it seems that this film went on for a long time ... basically because I could not bring myself to pay attention to any of the characters. I kept thinking .. Who cares ??? I found that representation was generally dead and that the dialogue was tense. I understand that this was the nineteenth century and all, but most of the conversations seemed somewhat abnormal. No one seems to have had any emotion in most of the film except melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> It appears that the "romance" in the story is not supported by anything other than "I am a young man and you are a girl", which I do not consider very romantic, yet I felt that I was directed to believe that these people were in love . Well .. I think that all this "all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to" write the thing, or whatever. I also hoped there would be some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (both seem to have had an interest in the girl at first) but this was just a kind of fall. Maybe avoid vulgar love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Well, Daniel Holt was about the only character I really liked. Su was me fine. I did not exactly hate Jake, but he looked a little too ... weak, I guess. Jack Paul I did not care about him at all. And I'm sure you're supposed to hate everyone except the poor natural people who fall on the left and the right. It was a great painting and led to the whole "horrors of war," but I have seen many other films of the same theme, and have been better implemented. (I enjoyed a lot of patriot, for example, even if it was a bit emotional play), but as I already mentioned, I'm cynical. What can I say? :)
