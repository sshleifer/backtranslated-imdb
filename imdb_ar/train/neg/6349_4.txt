Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedy movies ever, and I'll seriously think that Annie Hall is the greatest film ever, but if you really think about it, maybe I'll think of a better movie or two, but it will be difficult. Of course, he had some films that were not good, but they were not bad, like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had a bad film like Melinda and Melinda. Not very tired and not very familiar, his films are usually ingenious and hilarious but how did this happen, do we still have old Woody? The plot is about four friends having dinner together. Two writers of the play and one another reminds a funny story happened to her boyfriend. It is about a young woman exploding at an unexpected gala dinner. We never heard the rest because the two dramas start discussing whether to make a comedy or a better tragedy. We start to see two points of view. Both focus on this woman called Melinda who has a problem with drugs and her ex-husband. In this tragedy, an old family friend decided after she tried to commit suicide on the front door of her old friends for no apparent reason. The comedy revolves around Melinda, who stumbles at the dinner after 28 sleeping pills. They both give a powerful whirlpool of events that do not make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some wonderful performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not reconcile them together. They do not prevent him from drowning more than most other films this year.
