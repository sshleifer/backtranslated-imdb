I knew that the "evening" was a great movie, so I was expecting to be bored. An evil tease on IMDb said it was a "chick flick" but that your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Stay alive? Yes really. I'm still here, but when two of us came out we were surprised to find that it took only two hours - it seemed to me a much longer evening! I suppose that for yank, it's supposed to be high or fantastic because it's about the rich who live on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with large balconies and lawn mowers but no apparent lawn mower. If you like this kind of thing, it may seem like a short film. <br /> <br /> Monty Python's film about a knight will not die. We ended up being twisted (why Yanks adds a third section to this word that I wonder) The trunk in the road is still screaming at his threats. This film revolves around a kind of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (name inappropriate for the tomb dodger shown here) continues and dies while guilt is inappropriate. She is not worried about being a broad-eyed Bimbo character, but imagines herself deadly. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a girl film, there is a young man who is supposed to be Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff. I'm not a loudspeaker, so I can not claim to be a good judge on such things, but it seems that the boring trickster who was transferred to this role seems to be carrying the title of servant in his favor. It is pure bloodless. <br /> <br /> As you may gather, the main characters are not a big cop, but the small characters are managed, surprisingly, to be much worse. There is a colleague whose only task is to respond to news that his girlfriend is reckless. Fair enough, but it is not Hamlet's role - why is this so bad? When you forget that it was a girl movie, I thought he would be kicked out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that the facial fungi did not satisfy him, but I realized then that she must have encouraged him to grow a "beard" because he looked worse without her. <br /> <br /> I kept awake by observing actors and actresses who attached them to the earlobe or free and pointed to interesting scenes of the scene - if you drag them, see if you can find the stuffed buffalo head, this is just the kind of thing you expect In a cottage on the beach. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the compulsory wedding, there is only one element of action. I had thought she had gotten right. Unfortunately, although the hit and run accident is done by a car there can not be. When the incident is discovered, the actors walk around shouting for a character they can not know nearby (but we do with the audience). If they do not have any evidence that the person is a few miles from the place, why are they roaming around screaming aimlessly at him? I assume that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a sequence of dreams that no one remembers ... <br /> <br /> Another element that caught my attention is a small amount of copper. I did not think the technology to do this was developed until the 1950s.
