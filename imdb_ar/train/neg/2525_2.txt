This film, as Homer Simpson said, was "more boring than the church". I probably did not understand her well enough, and I thought it was good, but after (the beginning of the spoiler), Herman Brown was sent to jail and Maria started working / sleeping with her boss and just started in the clouds, and struggled to keep awake. Again, it might have symbolized something, but the explosion in the end seemed very disturbed and inappropriate. (End spoiler). In the end, I failed to see why others thought it was so wonderful, since I found it very boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie at my own free will, since I was required to watch it for a film category.
