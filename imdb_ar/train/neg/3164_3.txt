EVA Longoria dies on her wedding day when a snowy statue of an angel (without wings) falls on the back of a truck and kills her. She then tries to destroy the relationship of her former girlfriend with his new girlfriend, a psychic she can see. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the non-original film will not be bad in a vulgar way, but the character of Longoria is hateful and hateful because it drains all the fun of the film. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. Being fair in Longoria, no one else in the crew or staff, is not the problem, it's the terrible divine scenario that drowns the proceedings. It's just really stupid.
