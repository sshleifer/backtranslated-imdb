I can not believe that a lot of talent can be lost in one movie! The gingerbread man starts from the right foot and can build some great expectations for the end. But at some point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted. It is unbelievable how Mallory Dos Magician managed to attract the character of Kenneth Branagh from his nose. The climax of the films is monotonous and flat like beer, which has been neglected in the sun for a long time. Gingerbread Man may be the worst film ever made for Grisham, and this has not changed because of the fact that the talented stars are jamming the film. Do not waste your time here!
