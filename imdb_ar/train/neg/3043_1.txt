The film is supposed to be a "notebook" about Santa Claus and his magical and mystical wonders. Instead, it seems scary. Two things in this film emerge in my mind as two: the way Santa looks. And 2) "evil villain." The devil just pitch strange strange dances just a disease to watch. Watch this movie only if the version is MSTed or if you like to laugh very well. I can not believe that this is a movie for kids.
