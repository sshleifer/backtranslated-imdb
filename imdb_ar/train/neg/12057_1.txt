Charles Brunson continued his decline in the 1980s with what could be his worst film in the decade, if not at all. In this, he plays the role of an investigator who does his best to track the pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling them to the highest bidder. It is a shameful attempt at action and perhaps the most frustrating film of all. Many people consider that the sequel to death is the worst Brunson movies. The consequences of Death Wish were not fantastic, but in most cases they were very well done and watched. But Kengaite is a completely boring film, punctuated by violent expression and child violence. It is a film that can be reformulated, and it gets worse because of trying to spread the "law and justice" mentality that has become so exaggerated that it does not say anything. In fact, the film starts with underage sex with Brunson and then rapes the homosexual with a dildo. Chicago Theater, I watched this in cheers only when this scene was awkward, just to be excited when the pimp who raped the girl in this film. There is nothing else to exploit, and the film was not written well enough to rise above the level of exploitation and offer something that would work. Brunson seems more in things but obviously this is so disgusting that he can not be saved. I want to point out that I think Charles Brunson is the coolest actor of all, but this effort is in the end the worst he has. Traffic sequences are also poor. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (Awful)
