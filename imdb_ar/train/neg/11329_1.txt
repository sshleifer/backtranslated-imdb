Elizabeth Taylor has never been able to act and was just her annoying naughty character in this film. This was before you get a big fat but it still looks very short and stumbling. Rock Hudson agreed to be Bick Benedict, but it is clear that the actor with a larger set of games like William Holden was better. James Dean has certainly demonstrated that he knows how to mingle his way through a film. The entire movie is incredibly slow and lasts for a very long time. The actors were all young and light-weight, and none of them had a convincing age because of poor make-up. Hudson seemed ironic just to get away and it was clear that Dean and Carol Baker were the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
