As Steven Segal films go this one is down the barrel. His best was just a feed for bored teens. This one tips the tables, then falls off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is lame double. I can not spoil this by telling you the result. You already know how all Steven Segal's films end if you see one. Here goes. He is a super-conscientious government agent who knows a lot to separate, so they decide, instead of killing him, to numb his mind so as not to remember squatting. He runs away of course, and is located by an old general who needs one man who has a million experiences to recover a stealth plane delivered to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a rogue air force pilot, Surprise, Surprise, Segal Trainers. All the heroes, with the exception of Segal and his washed-up girlfriend, die heroically and Steve Bipp saves the whole world with one shot, or turns over. whatever. Made with some surplus air force and air force. And a lot of boom boom. Get some bob animation instead.
