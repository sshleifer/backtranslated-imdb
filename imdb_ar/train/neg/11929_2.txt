I had seen the "eye" before I watched this one. I really liked The Eye, it was one of the best recent Asian movies. So, I chose this Haunted Bangkok because it was the same as the director and it was kind of a popular tour here. But the guy, what a disappointment ... Haunted Bangkok is three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are not scary at all, not so annoying (as was the "eye") ... nothing. I can not even fill the ten lines required for comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. My rate: 2/10
