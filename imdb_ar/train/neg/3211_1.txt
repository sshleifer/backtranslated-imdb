It is located directly in the class "astonishingly bad" - no drunk students movie rental will rent a kick from. I was at the science fiction film festival and all I remember is a wave after a burst of hysterical laughter where this film was first shown. Other criticisms will describe the fecal nature of this film better, and feel bad about the poor man from the production company that appeared, obviously measuring the public reaction. What he got is the equivalent of science fiction to the drunken student audience. After an "serious" anime film, I think it was "cyan blue", the audience was in a bleak mood, and then opened the movie and within seconds the room was circling the islands. I will refer to the worst parts; script: the most entertaining and worst part of this movie, it installs it along a predictable linear path with an unthinkable situation at times. Rubbish, but laughingly. <br /> <br /> Animation: Done badly, put together, if you can deal with awesome wallpapers and gradually hanging out the heroine (I know I can!) The montage where "deform" from a Swedish peasant girl to LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: Unilateralism is painful, and there is a short coma story (with separate lines of dialogue) shedding a little light on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in short, if you have a captive audience and a few drinks walk around (try and make sure they re-alcoholic to ease the pain), then slide this movie into a DVD and get a mindset of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" . There is no other motive to watch this movie except to laugh at it, and it is not meant to be a comedy. You do not see this movie alone. It may be more boring to watch a solo of the New World with Colin Farrell because you will not be able to laugh out of the absurd with a friend or two.
