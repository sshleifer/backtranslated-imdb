This was a waste of time. Danger: If you are watching it, you will be tempted to remove a DVD from the wall and install it from the window. <br /> <br /> Amateur production: a terrible, repetitive, empty dialogue; a thin paper plot line; wooden displays Lucy Lawless was pathetically pirated. <br /> <br /> A seriously flawed story, totally incredible characters. The worst concepts in film and television are: (1) twin villain, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> A "twist" plot? The simplification is clear and obvious - like watching a train walk down the road in the middle of the day on the meadows. So it does not solve properly. Evil does not punish the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - do not see this even if it is free and your only choice is to go to a synagogue.
