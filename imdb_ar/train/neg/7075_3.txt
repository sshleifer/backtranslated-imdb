This is at least the third version of this movie. If you're watching it, there's a feeling of deja vu, and do not be surprised. All they did was change the story setting and tell it in a different way but the differences are not great. This is not improved because the plot is initially flawed. It never works. Like its predecessors, representation is below average. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has not seen the movie before but the end does not fit the story. If this movie ended ten minutes ago, it would have been successful and it was very satisfying and I thought it was worth it. But here is the spoiler and this in the end the crime does not pay because the criminal is not caught. I do not like this message resulting from a movie.
