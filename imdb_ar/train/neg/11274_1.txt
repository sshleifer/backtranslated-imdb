So that you colleagues movie colleagues get a point about this film, I decided to write another review. I missed some things last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, representation. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, what they were thinking about making a piece of trash like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no features ever recovered from start to finish only when Joseph Vince disappears at a very exciting climax !!! br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money in this when I could give it to a homeless person, a bus driver or something! <br /> <br /> Will you get the picture?
