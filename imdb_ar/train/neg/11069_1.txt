I felt cheated after seeing this picture. I felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they were thinking when they did this. Jeffrey Dummer is hard to kill and has no end. It was as though they were leaving this film open for a sequel. It was like watching a soprano episode. It ends abruptly, and you know there will be another episode next week. I also felt that I watched the first part of the film in two parts. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they became lazy, ran out of money, did not know the rest of the story, and wanted to make Dahmer 2. After watching this movie, they all seem to be very accurate. I was watching Jeffrey Damer walk through the jungle. Suddenly, I heard this music, and then came the writing on the screen and says how Damer spent two years of punishment and was attacked by his fellow jailer and killed at the age of 34. Wow, he goes from a picnic in the woods until his death in prison. What about showing how he got there. What about the trial of Damer? What about showing some details. I can not even explain what happened in this film because it jumped everywhere. I found myself saying in disbelief: "That's all, is this the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie so far. I'd like to tell filmmakers, if you do, do it right.
