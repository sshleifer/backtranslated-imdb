Very likely. How Francis Weber, one of the best comedians in the world (at least when he clung to his native France), was able to show an entirely undesirable film outside the realm of the fact that a mortal man distinguishes it. Not only are characters not very likable, or the film is completely devoid of the least intelligent: it is physically painful to watch it, such an endless show of ineffective writing, acting and filmmaking so you can not believe it is the work of experienced and talented directors . One time brings the eternity that you spend in the cutting room and on the shelf before its dazzling and missing play is released by telling the whole story. As they were thinking?
