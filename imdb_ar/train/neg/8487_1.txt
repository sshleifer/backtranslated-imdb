I have not seen anything so bad since I came out of the James Bond movie "Monraker" 20 years ago. I managed to sit in the entirety of this one just because Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing I could do to save this monster. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film has failed miserably in every aspect of filmmaking. The characters were cardboard and unable to raise any kind of sympathy. The plot was totally unbelievable. He was acting, except Swinton, amateurs. The computer graphics were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was very annoying. I can continue, but what is the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was there. I have no idea why a representative of her caliber has agreed to appear in such a courtroom, but she probably regrets it now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or time in this stink. Nothing worth watching here.
