The only thing that happened to me after watching this command, is that I would not get the time I used to watch it, again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael Dorn trying to earn what it should be like then, make payments at a holiday home and wait. Wooden representation, poor special effects, was the most comic thing while our foreign hero was in the form of a female and this ended as soon as she did her nude sex scene b-movie within 30 minutes in the film. The opportunity to make what could have been a decent film disappears the moment Nicole Egbert is recording a foreigner in a bar in 30 seconds, while the police, the army and Joe do not live on the fact that the woman drinks the coffee, does not use the cup handle, one time. It must be from another planet. Where I wish I were in this movie.
