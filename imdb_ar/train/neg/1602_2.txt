Anyone who thinks this movie has not been rated by the comic genius should smoke with two stones in the film. This movie is not low rating ... it's a bad film. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane as the last two films are well written and funny. Class reunion is not of these things. The sad thing is that they have such potential (good cast, good story lines) but good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny were more disturbing than the entertainment. Stoner men, vampire, blind girl ... not funny. The only ridiculous character is Delores (the person who sold her soul to Satan). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. Surely I was expecting more from John Hughes.
