Surely one of the films of a funny man Eddie Murphy is this nonsense about a kidnapped Sufi child, and three hundred years of dragons and "chosen." <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "chosen". The opening song refers to it as "the best man in the world". He is searching for missing and missing children, being contacted by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) telling him that he is "chosen" and that he is able to find and save the "golden child". For if the child dies, Mercy will die with him, for he is the bearer of mercy. <br /> <br /> If you do not demolish all this garbage that focuses on the focus of loss for you now, it is sure that the movie will spread. Suffice it to say that the plot is repugnant and destroys the entire film. The other vehicle is supposed to be the humor brand for Murphy (comedy is not a good mind for you), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dancer Kalshar Sardo Nomspa can not do much for the procedure. Silly and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
