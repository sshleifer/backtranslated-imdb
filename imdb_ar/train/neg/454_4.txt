Overall more than a movie rating that includes strong actors, some intelligent dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicolas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher, a central love story. Shir compensates for this almost with her reactions to Cage's changing tone and out-of-control body language. The crate simply does not settle in its turn. He tries everything he can think of and encounters as an actor instead of a real person and this is what is required in a love story. Cage faced the same type of performance problems in other roles that require more personal Jimmy Stewart. Cage continues to play these roles, perhaps because he likes this type of film, but his own energy as an actor does not allow him, although he is better off through repeated attempts. He must leave this kind of role to less interesting actors who are fully committed to the film and spend his energy and talent in the roles and films he has won the most, where he can be the same crazy interesting.
