When I first saw Robotboy, I found her new and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode this show tries to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. The episodes became predictable. The main characters are not interesting. Once again, we see a very intelligent boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a fat girl and boy. Also this show has no logic. The ultra-modern robot operates on two AA-sized batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activation and activation. We see two different robots, rejecting the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society"
