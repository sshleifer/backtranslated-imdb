I'm not very fond of joking jokes as a gender, but even according to low budget utilization criteria, this is really lame. Even at the level of ruggedness and paper, they are incredibly boring (there are some of both, but everything ... hey). Before the home video revolution, they may not have been theatrically released (although they may exist; after all, * Plan 9 from outer space * played in theaters). There is one good line (and delivered efficiently) accurately in the entire film; I suppose they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> Acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had good actors, and the rest tended to be ironic, which could be fun to watch. However, most representatives can learn to read and write. Here, those who do not read their lines like Indians in cigars, seem to have learned a voice. This film has one distinction: it manages to minimize badly for most of the film, and then is funnyly exaggerated to the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have identified the actress who plays the receptionist as an exception receptionist, she is not wooden in any way ... not that she is good, but she certainly is not wooden. > Even the worst slanted clicks of aging are generally good for some Protestant reflections in its hideous attack, but with this, there does not seem to be anything to provoke moral outrage around it. <br /> <br /> Do you know the most fun things? Obviously they expected the work of a supplement! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and so boring that it actually gets really weird. I sat through the video a lot wondering why anyone would go to the trouble of making it.
