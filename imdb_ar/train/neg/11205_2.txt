Yes, well, I certainly regretted giving up my Saturday night to watch this strange little movie, but it's too long. Apparently the main character did not steal two hours of my life. Here is the infinite example of "no regrets". We have this shiver, which has been corrupted, deeply rooted, selfish and aimless and intolerable, where it was very difficult to overcome the attractiveness of the son of a very favorite businessman, Jaemin, unless it was just: physical attraction. Claims otherwise, this is love. But after watching this, loving Charles Manson looks like you are digging a beard. (Well, it's not that bad, but there are not real properties yet recoverable.) I could never go beyond Jaemin's endless reason to chase Sumin. He never showed us, just told us, that Jaime loves Sumin. Maybe it was culturally flying over my head: mad / chase = mad love in Seoul. It must be because more than half of the film is a movie chasing the other and the last part is chasing back and forth to the point that I thought this turns into a spiral comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to give the appearance. Well, then Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so good yet someone is trying to improve himself. But after his first taste to attract his pursuer, he gave up his daily job for some kind of prostitution. What? Well, as we mentioned earlier, mania does not stop because of a change of job / function, and if you throw a bunch of very angry characters, you will get one messy movie where unbelievable events seem to occur without accumulation. A basic movie, not 100% terrible, but you can do better through foreign films of homosexuality.
