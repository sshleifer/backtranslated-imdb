I read all these reviews here about how this movie is good. Jeez, this film was very predictable and boring. The representation was below average most of the time, especially by McKenna. I have never seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone "poking" into a movie. Hey man, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that may be this cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this film was just an average part of the film. <br /> <br /> The script was lame, and most of the acting was acting, this movie was lame. > <br /> Oh and pray for the man who was cheering. It seems really bad. <br /> <br /> Probably the best actor in this movie is the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
