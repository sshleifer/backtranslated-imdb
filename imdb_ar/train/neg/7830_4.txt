So far the nightmares and Dreamscapes were irregular and disappointing. The first part, directed by Bryan Henson, may have offered little in the way of telling terrible stories or real fears, but at least was well directed, impressive and visually interesting, with a strong representation by William Hurt and very special special effects for a mini-series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was just appalling, not the good way. The film's scenario is bad, and it requires unsuspecting unwelcome heroes to act irrationally in order to move the plot, and make the characters roam endlessly for purposes of presentation that is not interesting and unnecessary. The representation is exaggerated and unconvincing, and she felt more sympathetic to the cold-blooded killer in the first story than the newly married couple in the second. The filmmaker used a million stunt to try to make the novel scary, but with the representation and writing amateur, the end result looks like a school student film project, with the camera moves for their own sake, little in the way of conspiracy or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues this way, it will frustrate me. I look forward to getting William H. Premium. Messi, and I hope to get a director and scriptwriter suitable for his partner. So far the quality is very inconsistent to predict either way.
