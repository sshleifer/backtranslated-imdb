The basic premise of the bright film, three young women destroy their car and end up staying with a creepy family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watch 36 minutes of obsession chasing an OJ with a white sedan instead of a Bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> An old lady with a hot and cold mute controls her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes of watching the actors eat - YAWN trying to determine what to eat ... well, there may be Game to drink here ... No - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... Well, I got my attention for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and uninspiring murder ... Yawning <br /> <br /> The end ... Exquisite! This psycho spoiled - why can not be the rest of the movie like the last five minutes ... Unfortunately this - my advice - quickly progress to the last five minutes and watched it and then put something good in the operator - for me I will go back to sleep.
