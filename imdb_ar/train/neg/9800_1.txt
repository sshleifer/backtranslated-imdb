Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came in 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese Sendai TV program that began in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese motion picture and series, you think I'll get a kick from this show. <br /> <br /> You may not be wrong anymore. What has succeeded in the Japanese version has become a complete defiance of the TV with the mighty power watchers. <br /> <br /> The MMPR is based on five teenagers with the power to become superheroes dressed in fashion with robot dinosaurs that make up a larger robot. <br /> <br /> Now, this idea has been imposed more and more funny than anything in the film Transformers, however, the absurdity of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> followed by two bad, I mean, that the film is very bad, and that the actors who play the lead in this series, disappeared completely from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, try watching the Japanese Zyuranger series instead. <br /> <br /> Also, what's up with the long haircut filled with the 90's and all the earrings on the men? Makes them all look feminine!
