I do not say that because the production values ​​were very low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl washing her hair in the Creek? Did we really need to sit there to get an extended shot and watch it do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, and the lighting was just bad. You can hardly see anything and when the characters talk, you can hardly hear what you're saying. Have you seen the whole movie? Of course you do not skip most of them, and I do not want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This movie has been performed very poorly, so that according to low and low budget standards, it is very bad. The movie is not wasted horribly any time unless you want a good laugh, but even so do not be because of the lines of "ridiculous" actors, but because of the extent of production damage.
