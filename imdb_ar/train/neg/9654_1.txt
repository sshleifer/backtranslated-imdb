The film is very bad. Simply awful. The bad film series of endless Bollywood! Their excuses must be exhausted to make such terrible films (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This film has good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to perform superbly ... but were very badly directed. The bad text did not help either. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a lot of ridiculous moments and very poor editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first major concert, Ajay Devgan, meets with Om Puri (who has been away from him for about 30 years and talks to him again) and all that Um Buri found is careful of his friendship with Salman! !! What a load of crap. seriously. Not to mention the baaad acoustics. Whatever happened to Shankar Ihsan Loi? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devon is a big mistake in filming a rock star. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. The same applies to Salman as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> He probably only watched it in the last half hour.
