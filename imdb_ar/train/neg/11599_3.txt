The only thing that prevented this flare from being a complete disaster was some elegant touches of interest. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Moderate Alert) Death by a little comic is derived from a scene in the twilight zone: the movie, which transmits death by animation. This is still handled well, especially seeing the ink bleed and the color that comes out. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a satanic motorcycle. <br /> <br /> After I said that, I was happy because I got a cheap DVD in the store coming out of the sale business, because this was so bad. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films were similarly annoying with the constant realization that you were seeing a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to recover, or have any meaning, it has at least some of the stylish notes, referred to above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, DVD lets you move to 8 "nightmares" where something actually happens and is the only way to see this. Scripting between creative moments is somewhat improbable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
