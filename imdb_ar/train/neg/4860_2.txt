Horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program out of my will. It really sucks! I, of course, talk about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I were to talk exclusively about those seasons, the show would have eight out of 10 stars. Not one of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons who were not part of the cast was good. They were, and they are, awful. Comedy is not funny at all. Absolutely!!! <br /> <br /> The original group was full of very talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever its name), and all should have had better deals after leaving MAD TV. This offer is pretty much overpriced and less time to watch your channel on Saturday Night Live, another awesome show. Go out on a Saturday evening and enjoy, and let the MAD TV melt away and die, as it deserves.
