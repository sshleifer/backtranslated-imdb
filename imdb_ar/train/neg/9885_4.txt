He won only the third billing (behind Arthur Tricher and Virginia Field), but this was indeed David Nevin's first role in the tournament and was absurdly charming in the role of Bertie Wooster of P.J. As an adaptation, it's like the 39 steps reversed from a real Wodehousian stroll. This is very bad because the interaction between Treacher & Niven is not out of reach. Unfortunately, the mystery of the movie "B" and the forced comedy is increased even in 57 minutes. The follow-up next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was out of sight, with no Bertie in sight and Jeffs (for all people!) Forced to play dumb.
