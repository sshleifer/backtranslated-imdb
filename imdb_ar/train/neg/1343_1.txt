We bought this movie from a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration, as we had already bought the movie No Big Deal, remake it. <br /> <br /> We expected this film to be so poorly inspired that we could reproduce it and place it on the tube. However, this was a shock. BORING is the keyword that comes to mind. The bad effects and scenario are not enough to make you see it. The woman's main body appears to be flogged at appropriate moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, this makes you wonder only, have they looted the budget, making them take off their clothes? If so, you have requested a refund! It looks like a homemade film, the stills are not even compatible with each other, and the camera works amateurish enough to make them make new bad movies look professional. I can not believe that this product is sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> It's just boring and watching. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism on the subject. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
