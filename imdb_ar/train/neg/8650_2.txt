If it was not for some immature fools, I know I insisted on watching this "documentary" when I never saw this comedy! This film is full of bad moments and laughter. One is in particular where police / Afghan soldiers have been detained without Larson for filming in the streets while allowing the photographer to continue filming his arrest and then riding his car away, still photographing, presumably in his luxury hotel. Then there is a scene where a car collides with another car that was turned upside down and stopped well on the side of the road without any evidence of a collision or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this currently got the rating he has (5.8/10). I thought IMDb users was more logical.
