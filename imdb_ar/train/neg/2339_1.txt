This rotational movie looks more like a mix of MTV music than a real movie. No real story While the film continues, ask yourself, "What will happen?" ; But nothing happens. The story about Eric Clark, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people seem to have nothing in common: why do they get them in a movie? With music, you can make watching the movie the worst thing. When I open the tap and come out with Bach music, most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie. The director must learn how to write a script for a 100-minute film or more before starting a movie.
