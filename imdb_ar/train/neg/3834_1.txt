I watched this movie after I really enjoyed the girl Gregory many years ago. This was Dravail. The plot was vaguely disgusting as the teacher and his friend spun 14-14 year-old girls into very short skirts. It seems that former commentators believe that this does not matter, but I found it rather bad. If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher is burning after his pupils. We were surprised that censorship allowed it. Apart from that the film was just a waste of time. The text was bad, and John Gordon Sinclair tried to reconfigure his pupil's image, which is a bit strange and on the wall. Why anyone who wants lust after him in this performance is incredible. This film failed in all respects for me. Horrible. Please do not waste your time watching it. Life is too short
