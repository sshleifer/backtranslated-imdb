This was the third new version of sleep with the enemy after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only person who succeeded and was a better film <br /> <br /> DARAAR directed by Abbas Mustan Who unfortunately failed in his attempt here <br /> <br /> The story was good, but the deal was not good, the heroine was shown to be too reactionary and her climax was disappointing. <br /> <br /> Direction is bad - <br /> <br /> Rishi regains his role in YAARANA (the stranger who also served as a remake of SWTE) and seems very fat for leadership and he is fine on his first appearance and manages many scenes to calm the crowd but his voice was terrible
