In the United States, very few films about Rome were produced that were not shown at the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. The Sword and Sandal Sword in Hollywood has mostly a Christian theme, making it difficult to enter into the previous Roman history (perhaps Spartacus was the first exception to this rule, encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it was not Jesus). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture not only before the time of the Tsar and Christ, but when Rome was the only city among many on the Italian peninsula, it overthrew the hated king and left the republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and although the production values ​​are not at the bottom, however, the representations and descriptions of the cardboard. I can not help but imagine how the dialogue was in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing, it is very difficult. I got some good laughs from him at first. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these films after I missed most Hercules movies in the 1960s. It is rather entertaining, but as the film progresses, it becomes somewhat boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I would love it. At that time, I went for anything with the Romans and swords in it. So at least, this flickered back some childhood memories.
