For starters, I would say I admire the American Pie Series. Although "Naked Mile" is the worst, it seems to fall the entire chain. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the film was the American Pie Movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of bad things to be said about this movie. First of all, the story contains an old arch structure. First, there is an introduction to the characters, then the pledge of the experimental house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of them has exactly 25 minutes of length. Regardless of the general nature of the scheme, there is little personal development, making a double strike of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, she hated the stereotype in this film. That is to say, the players of the CDs are the most wonderful players and thinkers only of sex, and openly expose geeks as inferior. It also shows females only as sexual objects, and only males want to treat females as sex objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, acting was also weak. Except perhaps Steve Tally. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, a film is generally horrific, if viewed from a critical point of view. Looking at it from the point of view of teenagers, I think it is better, but this film got 18+ in most countries, so the minors should not really see it.
