You know that the film will not go well when John Carradine (a screenwriter and storyteller) tells the funeral procession of his character, only 5 minutes after the film. Narration is the last will of his character. And provides for the division of his property between his four children and his servants. Children divide $ 136 million equally, but if any of them die, this share is divided among the rest. If all children die, they will be divided among servants. To be eligible, you must live in the family estate for a week. It seems like a typical scheme of a reality program. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext about the nature of the deans. They are a strong family and very holiday, but the real problem starts with dumping that dog. From the opening of the voice of John Carradine, you expect this movie to lead to the game of cat and mouse Machiavellian with crooked end. <br /> <br /> This journey is slow and painful. We move within minutes of watching people sitting around us, playing billiards, throwing darts, misusing a "shot through the fish bowl", dramatic conversations between a silk tie wearing men, persistent bickering, misplaced circus music, Expressive, aesthetic horror of grade 4 and piles of exaggeration in the drama. All of this inevitably leads to the expected and unexplained end. You will be happy because you are still alive, but the pain may be too great to bear alone.
