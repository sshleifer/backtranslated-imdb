Really, when it comes to it, this film is not funny. Josh Kornbluth is a funny antithesis, but he thinks it's hilarious. The plot to send 17 letters was fine at first, until Josh's approach "Look at me, I'm a fool" invades every scene. Judas Priest's joke may have been the least funny thing I've ever been aware of, and that's what he says so much, because it involves stiff competition from all the other jokes in the film. As for the excessive "Debaser" of the Pixies, I have only one thing to say: What did Pixies ever do to deserve such a fate? What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to urge him to write / output / production / star in a terrible film?
