Well, this movie was really "unique". Carrie Fisher was the most talented in the film, although she was said to have had a coke problem during the film. But she said she could not remember much of it. Well, this is her excuse, but what is everyone ??? I can not imagine they all suffer from the coke problem. No matter how bad, I think I think the plot was fine, and there were some funny moments. Although the part that the man gets on this thing in his head was very violent for my taste. Well, I think I was disappointed that Carrie Fisher was such a wonderful film and this film did nothing to her.
