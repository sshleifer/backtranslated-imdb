Until this new season, you are a fan of the Big Mosque. However, the new season has been completely tempered. <br /> <br /> The new Christian MP destroyed the entire intent of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. The new MP declares that the premise and shows the Christians in a very bad picture. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian or a Muslim, but I love watching the show and seeing the intimate friendship between Ammar and the priest. not more than that. <br /> <br /> Just undo it and do it. Not worth watching anymore. <br /> <br /> It may still be saved, but a lot of change is needed. <br /> <br /> Restore the old format.
