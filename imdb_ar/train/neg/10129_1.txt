I can barely find the words to express how wonderful this film is. I sold a promise to work, with the Segal and the Ghost, which are usually made for an action action movie. I can honestly say that I prefer to take my eyes off with a cocktail stick instead of seeing this film again. The acting was so horrible that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with a very wide plot openings so you could fly a F117 over it. The text was so bad, if I discovered that a 10-year-old boy had written it, I should not be less surprised. The trend and production are very amateurish, so I will not clean these people to videotape my enemies' couples. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this film have reduced art, and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Seagal must never show his face to the public again, and I can not imagine what made him agree to the representation of this film, the worst film I have ever seen.
