Alfred Hitchcock is not my favorite director by any means but imagining what he can do with this! The plot holds a lot of possibilities for suspense. John Garfield is excellent as always and Raymond Massey molded against writing. Nancy Coleman is not an impressive leader, but the support team is big and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, begin to retreat early. There are plenty of coincidences. An important theme is trivial by being in a little more, in the end, than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey, and performers. But it is not terribly good.
