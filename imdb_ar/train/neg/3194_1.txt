I can not believe that this movie was released recently in 1984. It got some funny work, not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever. Who will ask Sheriff Texas Joe Don Becker to accompany Italy illegally arrested in Mexico to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the film does not tell you anything about it - in fact, it's a general title for the movie / wannabe cop as I can think of it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this only on the MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They notice the resemblance of the female Ellen leads from Seinfeld ("none of them express spongy") and moves ceaselessly from Baker's weight. The film is probably no worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation certainly precedes it here: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I wish I were illiterate, so I will not have to read it."
