It is recognized that Parsifal is not an opera that can attract everyone, although it is my favorite, Knapperttsbusch, 1951 in particular. The entire Seiberberg approach is very constant. As soon as the music starts to swell suddenly ... Syberberg keeps the actors moving at the same pace. Take on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happens to edit the film? The result is physically stressful to watch. Spiritual scenes are never transferred. Your motivation is to rush home and run the recording again to emphasize that Wagner was right, Syberberg has made a mistake. And that decoration with those "smart" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism - would there ever be scenes of this film without prior knowledge of Wagner?
