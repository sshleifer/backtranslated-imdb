I can not believe it, IMDb already has every TV show known to man! I have not seen this show for more than 20 years. I remember only two rings, and I barely remember them. I remember that Tony may not start from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is one in which everyone tries to join Tony, but he refuses, but usually becomes a member of the Power House at the end of the program, encouraging everyone. <br /> <br /> And the one I remember is the one who pretends to be Lolo for some reason that he is dead, (complete with funerals and mourners). I do not remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those programs that convinced myself that I have to dream about them because anyone else has never heard of them before.
