Pros: None <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Everything <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: Correspondent meets a rookie who tells her stories about the death of people killed by zombie. <br /> <br /> Review: I've never seen a bad movie called The Zombie Chronicles. TZC was shot with a budget of about 20 bucks, a terrible horror film based on lame and forgetful actors who can not act to save their lives and increase their total horror. How can I get a movie like this? Simply, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> Last 2 Cent: With enough humor, this movie was produced by a film company called Brain Damage Films. Their brains must have been really damaged in order to make such a stunning film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (if it's up to me, this movie will get a negative rating bajillion)
