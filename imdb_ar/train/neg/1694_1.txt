This movie may sound scary in commercials, but the actual film was a cause for vomiting. This is below average, (even less) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and sure that a dead Japanese woman will scare the tube away from you, but what about it? Make a film that would appeal to observers and not just show pictures of frightened people and some hair (a dead Japanese woman). Can you say "the terrible rupture of Samara (ring)"? Do not get me wrong with the Dead Child. Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and can imitate it, a wonderful deal! Just bury the poor zombie and save some spirits that have the ability to be harmed by the grudge! 1/10! YUK! >. <
