Okay. from where we start. Let's just say this; avoid this movie at any price <br /> <br />. It's based on the animation series. The movie makes the drawings look like <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Full of abandoned actors that seem embarrassing because you <br /> <br /> here, the poor camera, terrible music, and enough features of the product <br /> <br /> make you not want to visit Yahoo! Again, this movie is really <br /> <br /> down the barrel. In the words of the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and Robert Everett have made their way through this picture with the abandonment of homosexuals <br /> <br /> from men who have discovered rare types of salary in the distance. "<br /> <br /> They must pay us some of the millions they have earned to watch. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
