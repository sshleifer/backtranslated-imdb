Aaron Spelling produced this Western-made film, which is so horribly simulated for a three-and-a-half-minute film that he is playing as a potential series pilot. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is an American Marshal Dave Harmon, who is walking around Yuma in Arizona County in time to kill one of the local bigwig farm brothers who set out on the trail. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a homeless Mexican gentleman who sleeps in prison. One night, Andreas falls asleep when a villain and another man in military uniform take the other brother to the street and kill him and kill Walker. Not good for the first twenty-four hours of your work. Walker visits the local army fort and ranks the commander's chains. Begwayg hears about the death of his brothers and goes to town in time to get his chains as well. Local residents, who are getting a brief change by the military on beef, are also getting a place in the chains. With all these strings in order, Walker still has time to attract the local hotel owner. The military man involved in the murder ends up being involved with the local cattle buyer, and the Indians are very reluctant to speak, culminating in an unlikely confrontation where Walker must prove to the city that the evil cattle buyer has a boss. , Someone we suspect was always very helpful. <br /> <br /> There is a sub-sub-plot involving the death of the Walker family at the hands of the army raiders, and I think this would have been the force behind the chain, which was captured. Instead, the movie ends abruptly, and I waited for scenes from the next week's thrilling episode. Due to the disappearance of the dimness due to the non-existent commercial interruptions, the speed of departure stops at this point, and the story spreads at the end. <br /> <br /> The Walker is sound and solid and has a deeper sound than a well. The rest of the staff is full of TV actors who may have seen them in other TV movies. Too many lame actions, lukewarm violence. The first brother who is killed gets a medium-range bomb and falls without scratching it. I did not expect Reservoir Dogs, but this is the wrong film that should be used to teach children about the evil of weapons! When talking about children, the Mexican child moves here from "gentle" to "dilating blood vessels that cause discomfort" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Westerners, you'll hate Yuma. If you love Westerners, you still hate "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not classified, but involves physical and violent violence with firearms. <br /> <br />
