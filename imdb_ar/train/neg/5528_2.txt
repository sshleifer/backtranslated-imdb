With this movie playing for only 61 minutes and nothing good on TV, I decided to broadcast the Revolt of the Zombies on DVD for a while. Even when I realized the era that was coming from them, I was very disappointed. I started with an oddly optimistic quality in the opening result (what - not encouraging music?) And then the opening sequences are rather slow to move. Gosh, I've made a film about the zombie - even from the 1930s - he'll have some chills (White zombie, with Bella Lugosi, for sure) - but that did not happen. zero. It was not dramatic (except for the few moments when the burning eyes on the film showed someone's fascination). Like the equally dumb zombie king, this may be an intriguing curiosity, but nothing more.
