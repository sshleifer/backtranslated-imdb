This movie is very bad. Horrible as in a waste of 84 minutes of your life. Very special special effects. Acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's about a crocodile attacking tourists who are watching while filming a documentary about Blood Surfing. Surfing the blood is when they walk around the sharks, but the error turns horribly when the 31-foot-long crocodile cuts off a holiday. Sharks do not look real. Crocodiles is worse, and becomes more pathetic when they escape from the creature, but the crocodile collides and 2 females. The deaths are fake and the pirates are only to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A horrible, meaningless movie is not worth watching !!
