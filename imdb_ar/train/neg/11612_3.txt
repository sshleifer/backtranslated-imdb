Detective Tony Roma (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after appearing for the first time under the title "Laughs". While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of Jamal Ashkar at the bottom of the sea, and her feet as you might expect, covered with cement. Rome immediately the case after being hired by mountain man Waldo Gronsky. Rome immediately finds himself at risk as he has to investigate some of the mafia, who run the tables on him and is himself the main suspect, and now he has to flee and hopes to solve the case on his own. Sinatra port tries hard to sell us lame jokes and makes us think he is a good informant, not to mention being sexually attractive to Rex and Welsh fox, but he failed miserably in this tribal vanity project. The astonishing controversy surrounding each female is amazing. Every woman in the film is a cloudy head, who likes to bend in front of the camera, and Douglas, of course, is obliged to zoom in on their donkeys every time they flex their back muscles. There is even a gay character in a ridiculous camp and believes that the beggars, this film was produced by "real men" for "real men" to reassert their volatile sexuality, is shameful.
