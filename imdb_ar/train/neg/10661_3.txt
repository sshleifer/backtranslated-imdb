It is "F.B.I." Starring Red Hadley, with an all-star guest guest! The film begins with an accidental hijacking (appropriate?) Leading to something, and another does not refer to the main story, "Big House, United States." Prison Break Story. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a television show, just more "violent" (for times). <br /> <br /> But - Trip representatives! This is Ralph Maliker being sent to jail; his cellmates are the following criminals: Brodrick Crawford, Lunny Chaney Jr., Charles Brunson (Read Muscle magazine!), And William Talman (read "Investigator"!) Honest! You should know that the early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, and answers the end to "voice commentary". If you do not want to get this comment, do not miss the opening scenes between the Snow Man and the boy (Peter Futrian works well as a runaway carpenter). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, United States (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
