Disney goes to the well several times, where anyone who has seen the original "LITTLE MERMAID" will feel very disturbed. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce them to King Triton. The celebration was quickly shattered by the sister of Ursula, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defensive tool to get Trident the King. When the attack was stopped, Ariel and Eric built a wall around the ocean while Melody grew up questioning why she could not go there. <br /> <br /> Awful and appalling is what this describes directly to a video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see seems to come directly from other Disney movies. I think Disney can only steal herself! Do not tell me that the penguin and the word do not remind you of another duet from LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include a re-match between Sebastian and Lowe, the Royal Chef. It's awesome under played it! The peak between Morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I will not give up anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed to be too crowded and could not be dealt with. From embarrassing to Disney, it is best to leave LITTLE MERMAID 2 for rent and laughter. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other disciples that Disney will plunge into later.
