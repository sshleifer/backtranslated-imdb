The work in this film beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possessed the great powers Leonidus in 300, New Matrix alongside Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Except comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I can not see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unrealistic that Anil Kapoor's long-range shotgun was the least faulted by the director. Except for Tachan directors to make this film there is no other Tashan. I regret to waste my money on this film and will not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can offer on IMDb or I'll give it zero.
