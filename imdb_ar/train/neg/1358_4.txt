The words "Swedish" and "Motion Movie" are not mixed. This becomes more apparent with every attempt made in this genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) operates in a military air base with highly classified computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to harm his family if he does not do what they say to him. They want secret equipment and will do their best to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a huge number of dips. Usually in Swedish motion films there are no "ups", just "down". So I think something in this film showed some quality. To start with positive feedback, I can say that the film is technically made. Screenshots of airplanes and helicopters flying a good shot and looks very nice. Representation is of very varying quality. Shanti Rooney performs well while Maria Bonifee is as cruel and abnormal as usual (wonder how long Swedish managers will continue to use them even if she has acting skills in a wooden board?). Stephan Sock is laughable as a "nice" special forces man who comes to al-Qaeda to investigate. <br /> <br /> What about scenes of events? Well, as I said above the sights of airplanes and helicopters were flying nice. But apart from that, there is not much to talk about. This is a common problem in Swedish motion films. There is not enough work going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe in filmmaking. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because quite frankly, the story and the acting are not good enough until the film relies solely on it. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this 4/10 for effort.
