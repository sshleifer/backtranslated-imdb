When I saw this film, around 1979, it became the first film I came out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than a comedy that misses being funny and this is wasted every time (although I can not talk about the last 25 minutes of the film). There was nothing original about any of the plays. Although I enjoy sudden humor when necessary, these short stories were unnecessarily vulgar. The most outrageous thing is that the film was announced as "Robin Williams's first film", taking advantage of his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy". However, it turns out that his role is so simple that you can not even notice him on the screen.
