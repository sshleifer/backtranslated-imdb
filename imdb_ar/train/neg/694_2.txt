It is the early 1980s. There is a group of teenagers with an age-old look that is suspicious. A maniac is chasing around. Yes, this slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called prank? I have no dim idea. Unless your idea of ​​a great joke is to hit again and again someone's dinner with a baseball bat - not a big budget; actually quite a garbage joke if the truth is told. But there you go. <br /> <br /> The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are cleaning a dormitory. They became aware that a mentally ill was about to leave. To combat this development, they are dispersed and wandering in the dark. And end up crying for most of them. <br /> <br /> Prank is a very bad movie. The DVD version I saw was Vipco. There seems to be little violence. This makes the DVD more useful because, let's face it, a hilarious movie mixed with violence is a waste of time. For only the refractive film and bad videos.
