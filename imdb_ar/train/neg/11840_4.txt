Anything potentially interesting in this article has drowned in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we see can never be known and "this is the whisper [rumor] most often" about one of the most exciting Hollywood mysteries. <br /> <br /> Okay. So we do not get anything new (and give you the "secrets and scandals" of E! E best foothold in the specific incident ... this is not much support). What did we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is the nest of snakes and corruption. There is no big news there. The most interesting thing is that we know what the washed manager wants to do to regain his position in the entertainment industry and / or the political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks from his own experience through these characters. But what has been said to him is ridiculous, ugly and disorganized. We have left the feeling of guilt because we are witnessing a handful of Hui who express themselves as history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is very strange. I found more anger than fun. We are not sympathetic to anyone. And the "Citizen Citizen" great clears the relationship between Davis and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In The Cat's Meow, we are not at all sure of Davies's motivation to be with Hurst. Once something is told to us, it does the work of the other. <br /> <br /> Do we believe that Davis was the love of Chaplin's life? Or is it just trying to provoke the wrath of one of America's most powerful citizens - and it seems unusual. The film never turns out. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the values ​​of production. There is a glorious recreation for yachting and fashion period. I got more considering building some of the flips on men's jackets than following the story of deforming many of the most famous characters in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the script is pure. Makes the disclaimer that sets the film frame only more temporary and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The performers can not be illuminated, although Meg Tilly goes beyond the parody here. Kirsten Dunst does not disappoint me. It offers sincere performance in a sea of ​​chewing landscapes. It is only Joanna Lomley that rises above the material, but to the extent that she seems to distance herself from the whole project instead of listing it. One of her first lines, "I'm not here!" I'm sure she wishes she did not. <br /> <br /> This is not on par with Petty Bogdanovich, very bad, "good in the last love." It's about trying something dangerous, but it hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is full of bitterness toward the Hollywood monster. This is the film "The National Inquirer". Not only polluting the names of those who put the film on board Oneida this weekend, but the audience is also very bad.
