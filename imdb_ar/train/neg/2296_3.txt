"Back of Beyond" takes place in a diving restaurant / dive station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Paul Mercurio, a shy man who suddenly finds himself in trouble when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. At first, we got confusingly like a flashback in which he and his sister (despite their better understanding of each other later in the film) hurried across the desert on his motorcycle. After that, it appears as a calm temperament, and sometimes, a mood in the presence of the arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know that there is something certain, a kind of Magregor of the spiritual senses, and his peril is at risk and like - the clairvoyance is only related to the story, most of which concerns three diamond thieves who disrupted the car and who depend on Tom to help them get out of Their place without falling in their way. Of course, Tom is with a thief, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, incites the three allies who do not really trust each other. But not in a way that really leads to any ambiguity or movement. In fact, it seems that the entire film wants to build something important, but it really fails to do so. Until the end, which plays its role as a campfire story (which really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), it is almost too silly. <br /> <br /> It may be worth trying if you do not mind the terribly slow speed, but in the mood, at least, for something a bit different from the usual.
