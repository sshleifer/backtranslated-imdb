The Hills Have Eyes II is what you expect and nothing more. Of course, the film will not be a candidate for the Oscars, it's just pure entertainment that you can only lose for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves fighting against the infamous mutation hillbillies on their last day of desert training. They only fight again during the entire film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie) because blood and courage are constantly moving in everything, and also the scene of the rape of another senseless statement shocked the audience. <br /> <br /> I will give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, just that. However, I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film progressed, as the clouds began because of its continued attempt to shock the audience with graphic shock and the occasional jumping scene just to make sure the audience remained awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just a decent entertainment, something that takes time if you are bored, nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
