A scientist and his girlfriend get out of the way when driving a car accident. He runs away unharmed but headless. He saves her head, brings him home and keeps him alive (!!!!). He then moves on to look for models and stripping off the ideal body of the head. His paralyzed assistant watches his head and starts talking and has a remote (or remote) link to a mutilated monster being kept in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, these are very stupid things, but I had a certain passion for it . When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this film about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed it on television on Saturday afternoon - unpolished. Seeing this on TV again then was fantastic! Frank blood and gore along with the hideous beast and sexual abuse are hapless - Who cares if it is good? When I see him now, I realize how bad he really is. <br /> <br /> The representation is very miserable, the production values ​​do not exist, the scenario is very stupid and (apart from the still disgusting bull), these are dim things. There is also light fighting between two villages and the great monster that is finally recognized. Also add in the end that leave tons of loose limbs. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of the 1960s film. On the other hand garbage is absolute. In both cases, it is not a good film but it should be seen (for once) for horror fans and viewers. <br /> <br /> The head laughed too creepy. Note the final credits that cause the title error (called "head that will not die")!
