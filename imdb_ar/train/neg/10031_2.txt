I saw the movie in the theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Karina's beauty may have two songs. This is. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even Indians in Mumbai (Chennai has now reached the semi-finals). But the worst I feel about the film is the scenes of the movement. Now Bollywood is trying to copy the motion pictures from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors are making a big impact to make it look real. Unfortunately, Bollywood managers do not have much time. They spend their time on songs and publicity for the film. Now, such scenes of stupidity in the south may work where the public pays only to watch their favorite actor kill a handful of people. But in Bollywood this certainly will not work. All the action scenes I wish I had sent. In the end, even some Chinese are showing up from anywhere to win Akshay Kumar. This is high stupid. The public does not pay to watch such a stupidity. I think Bollywood now has to forget motion movies. They can not do that. Another good work I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is very sad for motion picture enthusiasts like me. Do these people see their movie after it's finished? Can not they detect that slow motion (which is done by ropes) is unrealistic and very small? It is best not to have motion scenes if you can not handle them. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era where a movie like Zangger and Dewar was watching exciting scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but it is visually much better than the current era. <br /> <br /> This film should now be opened to Bollywood filmmakers. Please do not make any motion movies, so you get the art of making them realistic.
