The poor Robert Englund filmed another and at the expense of Toby Huber, who usually makes good horror movies but failed in this film. Englund plays the role of Mark de Sade, known in the 17th century who was jailed for his obsession with pain and pleasure in causing pain for himself as well as watching others who are also suffering from pain. The story is very confusing with flipping from century to century, and became confused about what was going on and what was the purpose of the film. All that I saw was a young lady who was locked up in a strange oddity that she wanted to keep for herself. The young woman became fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and discovered that among the dead, Englund was killed a few steps from one century to another claiming to be a descendant of De Sade and trying to kill her because she mentioned By her mistress Momusel (who was mentioned in that mistake) or who was in the picture above the wall of the Sadis. The movie was terrible, I was surprised by Hooper to hire Englund in this film and the special effects were very fake and funny, especially the eye part. Englund tries to return from his movement once "Nightmare on Elm St." Using these needles pull out and put out people's eyes. Horrible, very terrible.
