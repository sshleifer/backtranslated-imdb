Revolution of the Zombies (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost predecessor of George A. Romero's classic films. This was a low-budget butyl pot from 1936, which seemed to be probably fantastic for the fans of the time ... but it seems awfully rude these days. There is already a good scene at the beginning of a soldier firing his gun at a crowd of approaching zombie soldiers ... and near the bullets enters the naked chest of one of them. The effect seems hopelessly false these days, but I'm sure that in 1936 he had a thrilling audience. The story relates to the quest for the secret of mind control ... ostensibly to create a zombie army that can not be stopped ... but later as a way for one person to win the woman he loves. The length of the film barely for an hour, but it moves very fast, so it seems to me its length, believe me! There's not much to recommend ... you might get some fun from the studio's imitation footage of the star "wading" through the "swamp". The finish is interesting ... so I say that the movie is worth watching at least once. More than likely you'll see it as an added bonus in some cheap "4 Movies on 1 DVD" collections at Wal-Mart for $ 5. Hey, it's worth the money ...
