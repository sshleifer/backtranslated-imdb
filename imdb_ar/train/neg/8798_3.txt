I like a movie with at least a story. This does not happen in this film. It is a series of short articles without coherence. <br /> <br /> There are scenes for someone collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig does not remove her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the film and we never know why. Completely disappear after about 30 minutes. There is another stupid woman who cleans the man flat without end. There are countless scenes in the fast food joints where Mamaz and Babas were largely overrated by the California Dreams (I used the song). The dialogue is mostly about food (pineapple, chef's salad and drinks request?). I assume that most of the actors gained weight during this film because a lot of junk food was consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this film because there is no story. He claims this is a love story - it's not something like that. I just wonder why it did not hit the fast forward. I was waiting for something important to happen? No. Perhaps this is the only consolation for this film - the scenes have turned so fast that your trick is assuming there will be a revelation to all this nonsense.
