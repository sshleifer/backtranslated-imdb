A film is superfluous with characters acting so unsympathetic that I was not really interested in who would be the best (or was that the purpose of the film, to portray some people talking smoothly in New York City?) No love story here, no comedy either. The representation is very flat and the plot very predictable. What bothered me most was the constant joking with quotations from classic films. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less important is your film? Try to be your own! The small budget is no excuse at all, First Manager. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder they cost me only one buck ...
