The animation era of Disney was dying by the end of the 1990s. This Quack Pack should not be considered as flying DuckTales because the show barely has anything to do with DuckTales. It's about the character of Huey, Dewey and Lowy as teenagers, who have a problem with their Donald and speak hip-hop in full dress, unlike DuckTales. I prefer little adventurous sons of DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to McDouge Scrooge. The stories are frequent, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want a lot of hilarious humor, I recommend this. If you want to watch the best Disney show "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
