The film was so bad I could not sit there without doing something else. There was no conspiracy and no point. I was totally bored and for the film about a standing comedian, I could not remember a joke or a funny line worth describing. Politicians who do not speak attractive technical terms can not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> How was this made? Is there no quality control in the film? Watching girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this terrible experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in great comedy films, managed to survive this kind of exposure. It was not funny in this film at least, proving that writing is very vital in effective comedy.
