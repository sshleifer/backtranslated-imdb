See the 1936 version. When I find the voice of Charles Boer personally troublesome, it is more than just a match for Rodolph's world-wide drive and depression - I mean Omar Sharif is trying but not - very cute and vibrant. Katherine Denov (sp) Besides being old do not look like Mary - nothing! Looks so sophisticated that they do not even think of dying in order to love this man in such a way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film who plays the role they play is Ava Gardner, who appeared as Empress Elizabeth on the screen is appropriately short (and looking for images of the Empress there is more than transient resemblance) As historically, Empress Elizabeth did not share much In the life of Rudolf.
