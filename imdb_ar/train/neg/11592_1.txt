I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment is worse than this installment or vice versa. Since it has been nearly fifteen years since I saw this film, the fact that I remember little about it does not bode well. Maybe that's simply because I saw him once or twice only, but I doubt it. If there is anything worth remembering about this film, you can rest assured that I will remember it. <br /> <br /> At the time of the release of this film, the privilege was still entering the stage of death, so there was a lot of media coverage allocated to it. It is not a good sign at all when teen magazines contain explanations of the fundamentals of drawing. One of these articles should have made it clear that Freddy was so weak that he could not overcome the dreams of adult human beings, so he decided to pursue the unborn son of Alice. Good yet, but this is the task of the writer or director to explain it to the public. It should not be left to some irrelevant publications. <br /> <br /> Taking advantage of the trivia in Part Three about Freddie's concept, one can expect half of the scenes that will bring this humor out of the "infant horror" category, but unfortunately, it was not. The folly of the American classification system goes on to say that a piece of B'harni-esque waste like this can get the same scary piece rating as the original. <br /> <br /> By this time, a franchise can not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your view of it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide an effective representation. Or maybe just look competent compared to the rest of the cast. Either way, given that her last role was in something called "All New Adventures of Blade Chastity", I doubt that she really has anything else happening to her. Even old Robert Englund has been in better production in the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Since box office revenues were falling steadily, and not just for that privilege, at that time, I had thought that studios would realize that their film's eunuchs would not make them more sellable. In fact, such a film, like his immediate predecessor, was so neutral that he not only failed to attract a new audience, they both managed to alienate the core audience that originally supported the franchise. However, part of the credit should be given for not having the bright sense that made the fourth part too humiliating to consider. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare at Elm Street Part Five was given one in ten. By trying to attract everyone, or MPAA's idea for everyone, the attractiveness of one has succeeded. Such as parts two and four, one can erase them from continuity in full, and no one will notice the difference.
