I've seen some bad movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking about when they made this film. If the production crew had turned into a zombie when they came up with the idea of ​​making it, for surely you must be dead in the brain to find any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I admire most species and enjoy the "shoot" games, but incorporating the column scenes from the game has made this ridiculous and irresistible. <br /> <br /> As most of them already said, there was hardly any text and representation was poor. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who classifies this movie above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, otherwise it will have a very distorted concept of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I must say, I was more annoyed than the video shop, which gave this admiration, which led me to rent it. Thank God I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in films. <br /> <br /> The comic book man will be right if he says "The worst film ever"!
