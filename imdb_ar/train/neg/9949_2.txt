This movie could have been much better with script rewriting. I do not expect much reasonableness in the movies, but you think even a homeless Jack and urban dwellers will wonder why a group of experienced fishermen want to hire him as a guide. When reaching the fishing grounds, the poor Ice-T plays its role as if it will lead these men in the forest as never before. <br /> <br /> How did Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I suppose this film was based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago, this film was screened on a class of ninth graders after they read the story. I reunited the film, and dispensed with all the meaningless scenes and all the bad words. It ended up 43 minutes long.
