I completely enjoyed Bilal's story when I came out, and was surprised when I saw the trailer for this film, and even more when I found that Bilal produced it himself. The film, however, was a great disappointment. The pictures are nowhere near the rich and brave fabric of original artwork, and the story is bad. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the inner aspects of the narration, and he does not do very well in it. <br /> <br /> The most fun part of the original cartoon novel was the friendship and hatred between Nicopol and Horus. They were both out of the right time and place that forced them together. Most of all, they were funny and loved. Not so here. Nicopol does not have a distinctive character at all, and Horus is an eccentric who just wants to lie down. Although the film is French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We've all seen films that we enjoyed, but we will not recommend them all, for one reason or another. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, except perhaps as a warning not to exaggerate your talent and resources. Bilal is the main storyteller, but it is clear that he is not the master of every visible means.
