The eighties were not very nice with the star Charles Brunson who was once. Starting with "Wish Wish II" in 1982 and ending with this truly heinous film since 1989, the Brunson script writers seem to be trying to outperform each other. "D.W. II" left little imagination in his portrayal of the rape and suicide of Brunson's daughter (as was the rape and murder of his housekeeper with disgusting details). "10 to Midnight" was a kind of hateful film that made you want to shower afterwards. Nothing is recoverable from that. Other films such as "The Evil That Men Do" and "Wish Death" films, which have been overstretched, have crossed the boundaries between high camps and high streets with their portrayal of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure whether the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) have been kicked from showing a weary Brunson of the elderly destroying the bad guys young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the poor craftsmanship (and terrible writings) of these usually destroy little energy films that may Generate. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is fairly well done but it really takes misery in the cinema. In this film Brunson: Homosexuality is harmful. The pimp is forced to eat his Rolex watch; the male prisoner is allowed to rape by another prisoner; makes incredible statements of xenophobia among other things I've happily forgotten. It also depicts the gang rape of a Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off the screen, though implicitly). <br /> <br /> What did people think when they made this film? What was Brunson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible movies? For those interested in his best films, check out most of the films he made in the 1960s and 1970s, such as The Mechanic, Wish Death Wish, From Noon til 3, Once Upon a Time in the West, Red Sun, The Great Escape, The Magnificent Seven, Rider on the Rain, etc ...
