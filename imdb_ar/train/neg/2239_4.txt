The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that the reason I wanted to see this film was to see Gabriel Drake with all her glory. <br /> <br /> Ms. Drake must be one of the most attractive, most beautiful examples of the "luxury totti" committed by celluloid. From her time and her likes, only Jane Ascher approaches both brilliant. What were the actresses with the musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those like me who were impressed by Gabrielle, her scenes will not be disappointed in this film. She has a wonderful personality and leaves no of them for the imagination here. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the film is very poor and was in its time, made at a very cheap price. The song that covers the opening credits seems to last forever and is horrific.
