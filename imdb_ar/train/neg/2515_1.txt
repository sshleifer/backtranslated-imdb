This film is hated, and was supposed to be considered a major crime. <br /> <br /> One of the mysteries of the film industry is why no one has made a faithful film of this wonderful mystery. It is a truly mysterious story, a romantic old-fashioned romance and a dry English humor. Why did the automakers have to change Richard Gordon from Scotland Yard to an amateur detective, give the stupid role and his English comedian, change the main story about murder and Gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? Those producers and directors who always believe that they are capable of making a better story than those in the book must write the original text themselves and not rape someone else's product.
