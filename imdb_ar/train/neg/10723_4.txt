The old mummy's spirit is transferred to one of his followers so that whoever participates in the desecration of his grave is punished. The transformation of the spirit makes the young man grow old at a tremendous pace until he looks like a mummy. One after the other, the blood is drained from the participants in the excavations. <br /> <br /> In order to be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's curse is the murky issue. Although the film offers some good original ideas (mummy sucking blood, moving the soul, interesting make-up effects, the scene of arm-ripping, etc.) and a few moments in the atmosphere, the direction and speed are the basic definition of frustration. To make matters worse, the first 15 of the relatively short film duration of 66 minutes consisted of nothing more than padding. I usually go for these slow motion mummy movies, but the curse of Pharaoh tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodan is the only bright spot? I hope the film focuses more on her mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the screenplay. Finally, I do not know whose idea was to put the mummy maid in what appeared to be pajamas, but it was a ridiculous and ridiculous look for a creature supposed to instill fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaoh's Curse, I will post it on 4/10. Not a good rating to be sure, but generous due to all the problems I face with the film.
