I did not expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Festival this weekend. It was an alternative option when two other films were sold. However, I had hope. It looked very much like "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. The Man Falls for Indian Beauty, Parental Conflict, Blah Blah Blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a fun movie with some good laughs and beloved characters. <br /> <br /> My Bollywood Bride did not have anything like this. The representation seemed padded and a way of numbers. The characters were very vulgar. The story seemed to be written by a high school student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seems as though there is a lot of dubbing in the dialogue. I mean a lot. I know it is necessary sometimes, but it seems that half of the film was filmed in a closet and it became very startling. <br /> <br /> Two fairly generous rooms.
