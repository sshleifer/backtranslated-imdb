Marilyn Miller made just three films before her sudden death - Sally the Magnificent (1929) and Comedy Hare Majesty Love (1931), a trifle - New York State University (1930). She is quite poor as an early conversation and a musical attempt - even though she has four dance numbers, she sings only two songs (who and Un-Man alone). The rest of the points including the sharp address melody are abandoned, although we can hear the latter in the background record. Miller seems to be overweight and amateur here - there are no quality stars at all. Even her dance is clotty. The film is very poorly written, full of meaningless jokes, funny and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as a performer, you should definitely check it out, but for public entertainment, stay away.
