This ultra-low-budget comedy succeeds only in being a low budget. The dialogue is extremely stupid, and the scenes are boringly boring, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of collisions and explosions in the parking lot during the last five minutes of the film (short port potty bulb) early in this scene is certain To smash and scatter the crap on the main villain of the film - no support here without purpose). The entire film is sadly reminiscent of the one that sometimes came out of the studio of Rodger Corman when he gave an initial exit a few dollars and a camera - but without the discipline that Korman would impose.
