Sorry fans Fulci, but I could not get this one. The soundtrack was disturbing when it came, and the acting was childish, the story was executed and performed, and the direction was absent. <br /> <br /> The carnage honestly looked like a children's film project. But I have seen some of these, they are actually better than this! He seems to have been so underfunded that they can not afford ... anything! No DoP, no way out, no one even had an idea of ​​what he was acting. It was a very bad film experience. One of my worst cases. <br /> <br /> This was about the worst festival I've ever seen, next to terrorism that is second only to Keller Clunes from outer space. I have nothing else to say about it. <br /> <br /> An assessment of 0.1 / 10 of the ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
