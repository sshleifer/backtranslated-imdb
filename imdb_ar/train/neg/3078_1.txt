I did not think it was possible for a horror comedy movie to fail badly on both fronts .... really awful. The fact that he does not take himself very seriously (usually a good thing) works against him, primarily because the actors are so rude that you will really split that they read signal cards. Although ..... MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ....
