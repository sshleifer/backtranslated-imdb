I'm a fan of Matthew Moden, but this movie - which I stumbled upon on the cable - is fearless. I see that the screenwriter and the director were identical, so there was no one around us to check out her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, no original characters. Gold was essentially the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this talent by proxy. Given the cost of photography in New York these days, I must wonder how to achieve this in the first place. If you wonder why I saw him at all, he came after a film I liked on the cable and left him while I was working on the computer. It's not a very difficult picture!
