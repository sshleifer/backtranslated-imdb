This film is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also more entrenched than both, and not as good as it is. It is slow and somewhat predictable. As he got a shadow of delivery and Amityville Horror.plus, we get some new age flavors thrown into the mix and some of these scenes come as a motivational / inspirational speech. This film is a mixture of almost everything. And even though it's great, the make-up effects are not very realistic. In fact, it looks rather cheap. Besides, there is a really terrible cliche dialogue. I will not say when, but there is a point where some personal actions are incorrect or believable, given the circumstances. No one in their right minds was acting that way. Once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. There is also some unwarranted nudity for nudity. It is not necessary at all. The good news is that acting was actually very good. The best of this film is worth so, after the evidence has been carefully evaluated, the ID says that this film was acceptable, but not good. My judgment on The Tooth fairy: 4/10
