This is another of the many B-minus films that have been classified as a Noir film in the hope of generating some interest in something devoid of it. All aspects of the film - script, representation, direction - are mediocre. Representation of three wooden filaments. I think John Dal was expected to go to filmmaking, but then someone realized that he had little talent, and ended up doing television. Lee J Cobb, who is usually great, can not rise above bad text and bad direction. It is supposed to be Jane Wyatt of women who start killer viewers. The film contains two of the weirdest cars I have ever seen, the car followed by John D. after a particularly curious Jie Kopp. Move a typical Alpha DVD.
