I saw this film for several reasons, most notably Mira Sorvino. With her on the cast can not be so bad. It seemed like he had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and was good at "not believing". The story is set in Spain, so it might be a strange entertainment film with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking the same thing, let me warn you: this is a really bad movie and uninteresting movie is boring. The only thing that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is full of sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative. They are trying to build a slant / suspense by looking at fascism in Spain but they fail terribly. The torsions have no credibility and the alleged investigation does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin paper! I did not care about anyone. More than that, they are very annoying and hated people. <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome. Mira what is your? Why Mira? You are the winner of Oscar! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak but that was no excuse for such terrible performance. She seems to be sleeping throughout the film. Come to think about it, I think I actually saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I thought this woman was exciting. Well she is not here. If you want to look at some of the skin, try Rumi and Michel because there is nothing to see here. This tone? Oh God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is the worst. It is very painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I suffered enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This entire movie is frustrating! It's very bad at all that it's amazing how it was made. Bad team to produce a poor script and earn some money on the actor's name. Do not fall on it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
