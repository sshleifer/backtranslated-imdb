I screamed from my head because watching this film was my first film ever going through for about 13 months. I remember it being incredibly bloody and made me angry. I watched it back on TV a few years ago. Big mistake - acting is wooden, the plot does not exist and the film lacks merit unless it is 23 years old T & A is what makes you go ... 0 / ****
