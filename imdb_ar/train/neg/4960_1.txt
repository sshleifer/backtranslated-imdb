I'm a fan of Batman Cartoons and I became frustrated when I could no longer find Batman: the cartoon series on TV anymore. I was excited to learn that there would be a new cartoon for Batman on TV. I watched the first episode on the day it was first introduced and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is very bad. It looks like a cheap Japanese anime crappy. Then again, like all modern animations like it. <br /> <br /> Character designs are even worse. Batman looks like Birdman, Catwoman looks like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red copy of Hulk, Penguin is Mr. Kung-Fu, Mr. Marlene Manson is a gothic look (the funny thing is that I do not expect geeks and mysteries to be gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst design for characters is the Joker design. They turned him into a monkey / fighter Bob Marley / Kung Fu! Joker is supposed to be Batman's biggest enemy, but in this exhibition he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and futile. In one episode his plan was to put Joker's poison in dog food! What an evil! Batman is a wonderful and complex figure because he is haunted by the death of his parents, and that is why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem to be haunted by the death of his parents, and it is not exciting at all. Nor is he an investigator, he is just a fighter. If there is an enemy who can not defeat it, the enemy will not study to discover its weaknesses like the investigator, he will only build a giant combat robot to defeat them. Often, this show does not seem like a Batman show, just another anime without brains is nothing but a meaningless fight. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the bad guys. They have removed everything that makes them loved and can be reconnected and turned into evil villains. Man Butt is the biggest example of that. In comedy, it is a tragic world that bat studies to find a cure for its design. When experimenting with himself, he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature. In this exhibition, he is a mad scientist who wants to transform himself intentionally into a giant bat creature without a clear cause. Almost all bad guys are like that. None of them, except for one or two, has an actual motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst description is Mr. Friz. In the comedy, Freeze was just a crazy world until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote a BTAS episode "Heart of Ice", which gave Freeze a new asset that made it more tragic, tragic, 3D and loved. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as its real origin and was even used in comedy as its origin. Even the movie Kraby Batman and Robin used as an original. In this show, he is a small thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After he became Mr. Freeze, guess what? He's still a small jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it on those created by my religion. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not like this show just because it's not like comedy because I also liked the BTAS, the Batman comics that followed Batman's Tim Burton movie, and obviously Christopher Nolan's brilliant Batman movies. None of them were 100% loyal to caricatures, but they were still very good. The problem with this presentation is not that it is not exactly like the comedy or BTAS, it lacks any kind of depth that makes the other Batman modes very common. <br /> <br /> You have given this offer many opportunities but the more you see, the more disappointment you find. I miss the old days when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.
