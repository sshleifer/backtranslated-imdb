I love Chris Rock, but I feel he is lost in this film. The idea of ​​remake Heaven Can Wait is good, but filmmakers have closely followed the conspiracy of Turkey. When Eddie Murphy re-edited Dr. Dolittle and Mr. Walnut, he completely restored them - until they became Murphy movies / cars, not just a lukewarm reproduction. That's why they were successful. If Chris has done the same, this may be a much better film. The little laugh that comes is when he does his own standup routine - so maybe he did a musical. It will also be more entertaining if the white man is inhabited by a truck driver or modest. Why does Hollywood continue to make such an unwanted? Because people go to see it - because they love Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not reproduce movies that were not good in the first place!
