Brain That Would not Die is an awful piece of film that emanates from the opening credits. All the classic tags have unfortunately become: an unreasonable landline, a terrible representation, low light sets and lighting. The figure goes: When the doctor and his fianc√© are caught in an accident, they cut off their heads and take their heads and take them to their laboratory, where they put their heads in a container with some special liquid that keeps them. Alive. I bet Virginia Laith, who played the head in a pan, spent a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that frying pan around her neck and squatting under a table. Anyway, the doctor tries to find her new body, and hires two strippers so she can choose one for her new body. Bad along the way, very badly shredded into parts in Mystery Science Theater 3000.
