Do you realize that you've been seeing SAME exactly exactly eight years ago, right? I can understand the initial curiosity about seeing strangers living on an island, but you think that after seeing the unskilled, smelly heroes running in the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade, that would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more (And interesting). <br /> <br /> I am not even talking about the validity of the offers I find questionable about the record. It is difficult to just suspend the disbelief because of the "Bushy Bill" of the mouse when a full crew of producers and camera people are housed in a lively air-conditioned dome flying in cold mochcinno with moxy. <br /> <br /> Call here? I do not care about these people or their winding lives. I just do not get it. But if you find yourself fascinated by people who are hairy and unpopulated, I suggest you turn off the TV and make a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their real home. Called "people in their homes" and free, you can sit and marvel at their exotic ability to recover the assorted cigarette debris from a large number of garbage cans, eventually leading to "dirt pushing" and making homemade cancer for Dr. Frankenstein. All the time, people beg to change for food when the scent of Aqua Fleva is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Much like the survivors, each week belongs a member of the tribe "leaves" "island" when they are sent homogenously to the local institution when the full schizophrenia start frightening in anarchy. Now this entertainment!
