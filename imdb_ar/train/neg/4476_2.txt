I watched this movie premiere on MTV. I have to say that this was very mediocre (at its best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, I have left feeling like there were a lot of holes in the plot. There is no beloved character in this modification due to misrepresentation. I just find that all characters are heavily owned when it comes to someone you love. Also, Kate and Heath seem to love incest too. They seem more like a brother and a sister than a lover. I do not understand why the father accepted something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of a few actors whom I respected and enjoyed watching in previous films, but as I said, it is very hard to love any of the characters. The performance of Katherine Heigl was terrible and was a complete shock. It was awesome for being the older sister of Edward, and there were not enough lines for Amy Osborne for me to even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did a good job and it was good to see him in a modern thing and although his personality was a bit weird, he was the only person who liked him. As for Erica Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our champions, but they were fantastic and thrilled. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy this movie very much or its music. There was a short appearance of the Christian evil band, MxPx, but this little look would not convince me to watch this film again. MTV did a great job convincing me that this was not the case. I just picture something completely different.
