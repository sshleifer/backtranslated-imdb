The story line was very straight and easy to follow and contained a lot of comedy that did not need to think so much that it became boring. Some people seem to have looked funny, but I like the most intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were many Swedish actors known in the film and their performance was appropriate when thinking about the scenario. Lena Indry was as good-looking as ever. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original film, so I can not say whether it is better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie may be worth a look at.
