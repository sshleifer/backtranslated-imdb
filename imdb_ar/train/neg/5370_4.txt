Råzone is a terrible movie! It's very simple. They seem to have tried to make a film to show the life of the pulley. As Zaba did several years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is still mostly the little girl in the film "Jul Krummernes", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the film play with the spirit outside and this is the destruction of the film! <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie you should see it. I do not agree that young people behave that way, but I think it can explain how it can end, if you leave your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film folket"! <br /> <br /> In general I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a film that deals with important subjects. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes, and in fact in these scenes, Laura acts better. - Like the end where the gun stuck!
