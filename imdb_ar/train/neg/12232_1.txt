Horrible story, misrepresentation and no humor at all (apart from the last joke in the end) <br /> <br /> A kind of ugly landlord is sent to the ground to save a boy and his mother from getting rid of the home. The film is supposed to be kiddies, but even you will not be entertained by this terrible movie
