Watching this was like getting big mackerel fish slapping into your face again and again. So when I thought, "Surely the mackerel can not come again," * Slap * There were. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the kind of pilot I have seen and wondered: "Do the actors know they were on a ship that is doomed and can not be turned into a chain?" Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian as well. While Blazing Saddles turned these stereotypes into a mixture of comedy and discontent, these stereotypes were just an outright attack. There was no plot line, the end was put to an end, jokes are not. However, if you are a student in comedy, watch this pilot program to see what you should not do.
