Anyone who already has the ability to sit in this movie and get away from feeling like a good film does not appreciate the quality of the movies. This film was an insult to watch, and the trend was the quality of the film class in high school as well as the cinema. The Blair Witch Project had a better cinematic and I hate it with passion! The story of the film was likely to be a very good and intense film but slowed down in the first ten minutes during the rest of the film. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, well that's all good and fine. But they can still do better with this text than they did. I mean Come on, Indian at the store. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian story and the whole story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Who told him to the store clerk and says that no one is working here, so you think the scary ghosts scenario is okay, but then you're not paying for the amount on the idol and forget the little boy who sees this guy. It was very lame because it goes beyond pathetic. I finally left wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with a feeling OMG !!! Why the hell I'm just wasting my time watching this !! This is a step I recommend not watching, there are definitely movies of better quality will not insult your intelligence! Thank God I did not have to pay to watch this movie, I would ask for my money! For those who have enjoyed this movie very easily ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of filmmaking to actually say it's a good movie.
