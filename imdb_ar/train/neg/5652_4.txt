This is not a bad movie ... but the kind that makes your girlfriend watch it. The story is not bad .... it just makes the hour and a half look long. It's hard for me to get rid of this film because I really like the idea, but it was just a long, thin story ... very bad. The main character does not seem to change all that from start to finish. I mean going through something "life changing" and he can barely break a smile. I really thought the Mac was really good. Strange strangeness that prevents the film from a complete disaster. Maybe I do not get this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I'd love to share with you.
