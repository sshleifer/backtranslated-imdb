If you want to watch a good movie about how a woman can resist sexual abuse, this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social comment about a woman who was a victim and struggling again. The spoiler: Rosario Dawson runs the attackers. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilance. Is in essence invalidating the judicial system. The film "The Accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What does "get off" is to tell victims of abuse that they have to resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accused? No!!!
