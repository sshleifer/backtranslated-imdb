There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even the smallest scrap of talent. Nobody has ever tried before to act before, so the additions at the cafe look as if they were stuck in place. Nothing looks like a rehearsal. Awesome movie quality. Most of the "procedures" take place in narrow corridors or apartments with the haughty photographer as a later idea, with some cheap cameras swinging forward and forward among the "actors" as they present their lines. No tripod nor microphone is suitable either, there is sound quality is terrible. Even the "Manos" better than that, at least they had the right equipment. What is lost there simply gets lost in the production mess. <br /> <br /> Adhere to home videos, preferably made by a 5-year-old child who is testing the video feature on my new dad's camera phone. You will be in a long search to find the most incompetent film of this.
