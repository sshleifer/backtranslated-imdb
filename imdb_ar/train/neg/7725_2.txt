This film is one of the most unintentional bad-action movies ever. The game "Dolph Friggin 'Lundren" is funny enough, but it is a great addition from friends to the mix, an eccentric and supernatural villain, a subconscious sub-plot, and one of the worst endings of all time. Suicide treatment for people who enjoy their lives, and even watch the "confrontation," never thought of killing themselves with a stove. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me but the full gay text is not so subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, not by females. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about the male parts of each other, and in fact before embarking on a suicide operation, Brandon tells Delphi: "If we do not, I want to tell you, you have the greatest I have ever seen." <br /> <br /> Now , Is this what an ordinary man would say to another man? In the movie ACTION Do not say? Do you want these words to be your words? <br /> <br /> Later, there are these gems: <br /> <br /> Dolph (Regarding the villain): "I would cut some parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you have installed." <br /> <br /> As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph did not respond," I've got installed? I've got installed?! You are the person who decided that his last words should be about my soldiers! I was just opening his ears and nose, man. "<br /> <br /> These are absurd things unabated and great fun if you are a person who enjoys receiving root channels from unauthorized dentists, without novocain ... It's equally great fun for the entire family!
