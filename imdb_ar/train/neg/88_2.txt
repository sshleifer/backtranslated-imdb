I was looking forward to this film. It is a good family movie however, if the editing team is Michael Landon Jr. The better the editing, the better the film will be. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there will be another movie from the series, all very good. But, if another one is created, I beg them to be more interested in editing. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. This is unfortunate because the other films from the series were wonderful. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy. They are both great role models. In addition, the romantic side of viewers always has a good love story.
