I do not know what it is with these Brady children. First, Barry Williams publicly boasts of his adventure with his television sister Maureen McCormick, and then of dating his television mother, Florence Hiderson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen plays a bunch of pornographic films. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland is having trouble driving drunk. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Bloom may have been subjected to the same sex tossing on the side. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight follows a beautiful young model in her early twenties during his "Surreal Life" period, which was initially fun, now married and in a highly volatile and hostile relationship. She was not the last step, as she showed a bunch of bare pictures with another naked girl to the scrapbook to present to Christopher on his birthday, a good step on her part. I treated her in a very mature manner, just picked up and left to clear his head. I think he always bent on all his needs and now he takes a stand in the end. I hate to say that, but I think they violate it verbally. The way she tortured him for the engagement ring and the way she responded to everything small. She also speaks frankly of stumbling with other women, and obviously still sleeps with women and men, and this is not something that any self-respecting person should do when he actually marries someone. If this is a man who talks to his wife this way, goes out every night at parties and fucks with other people, everyone will be behind the wife to leave him. Why this should be different. What began as a cute little crush on another reality has flourished a huge disaster. Adrian, like beauty, looks like Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, and she clearly needs some treatment because she cries like a child for so many silly things. I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to rid herself of her, because he is a good man who can not afford humiliation like this.
