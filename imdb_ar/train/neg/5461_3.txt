Like all TV shows, there are a bunch of people who like the Twilight Zone so much that they practically evaluate each episode as if it's the greatest show ever. While many of them are really classy classics, the truth lies in each wonderful episode, there were many of them were modest and at least one stank. However, like trekkies fanatics, the lovers of the region insist that they all went. In fact, that is what prompted me to first review some of the individual episodes of the couple's cult series rather than the films I usually watch. <br /> <br /> While this is not the worst episode at all and is not among the worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. A widow sees a long convoy of civil war soldiers crossing her house. In the end, a very unexpected development is revealed and there is not much excitement or suspense here.
