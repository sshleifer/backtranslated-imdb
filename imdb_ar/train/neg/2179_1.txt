I loved watching it even though I enjoyed a very bad movie. I saw this movie through the useful irony of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have a DVD. If you flip the other side of the DVD, it shows the actual movie, so you give it a chance. Seriously, people this is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The effects, special effects, and plot are generally very cheesy and unrealistic. "You do not need two lungs," Crowe said, noting how the head can still speak when there is no body. Tom Cervo sadly says, "No, you've got neck juice!" The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between strippers. That "meow" after the battle or scene, however, was classic. So, in some ways, it was an enjoyable film. I think that for horror lovers, you might enjoy it. For a good time, watch the version of MSTK3, you'll get a big laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K: 10/10 The Brain that will die: 1/10
