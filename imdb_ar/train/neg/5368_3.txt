Special practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I think my biggest complaint is the lack of authenticity in the lines of the medical story. Just by watching the house, I "analyzed" two medical gasses (out of nine) before doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some of the old emergency rings or some mysterious medical soap? The house is modern and common - it's hard to get rid of their thoughts ... <br /> <br /> The second biggest complaint: They're supposed to be forty years old, are not they? Then why should they act with the emotional maturity of children 15 years of age? It is three weeks (ie three full curse episodes) of intense thinking is really necessary to understand that if your favorite friend does not want to be a "friend with benefits", it may not be because he wants to hurt you, but because it does not hurt him. The personality that all thinking does is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole story is so unrealistic that you can not really participate in the alleged "drama". <br /> <br /> I will not even begin to complain about what the show did with Edison's favorite of all, where we met her in Gray's Anatomy ... On the side, do not you think it's funny, as Edison ends up craving after the loser Pitt ( Sorry, but everyone who tries to cure him (Insomnia with a RexMart is a loser, Ph.D. or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with Melrith, annoying miles away in rainy Seattle? Apart from this little flipping with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think the subconscious mind of Shunda Reims tries to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is the right choice ...
