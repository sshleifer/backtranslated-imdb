A television program from the 1980s, updated with a new female flesh and a wicked language. "Dukes Hazard" passed through me; it was not repeated when I was in front of TV in New York or California; or, perhaps I had seen. However, from somewhere (like the footage associated with the 2005 release), I knew it was a bright orange Dodge Charger, and General Lee was still good. <br /> <br /> Hankey's cousins ​​Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are "Riders of the Orange Sage". Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) is filled with her short stunt, but even her thrilling bikini can not beat the competition from a crowded dormitory. The very stupid plot includes Bert Reynolds Gray (named "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazard County into a sector mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar Sean William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Bert Reynolds
