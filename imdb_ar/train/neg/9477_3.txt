This must have been one of the most horrible wrestling ever, and it is saved only by two matches. Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, and also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete laundry. To be honest, I left the bedroom completely, the coffin was not worthy of being shown by the Undertaker and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you are a fan of WWE and have missed the first days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19 you are likely to like it. But I found that this WrestleMania left much to be desired.
