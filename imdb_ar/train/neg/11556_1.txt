Oh, those Italians! On the assumption that films about the aristocrats with strange crumbs, sinking into a gothic atmosphere, and relatives knocking in the back trying to put their hands on inheritance is inherently interesting for everyone!

Even the charming Erika Blanc is lost here. <br /> <br /> 0/10 <br /> <br />
