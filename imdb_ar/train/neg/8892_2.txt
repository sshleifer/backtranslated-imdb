Must admit, this version shames Shakespeare in advance! Nothing could have acted except the nurse that was my FSA! Juliette has good teen skills but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we can never communicate with her. It's the worst scene to do when you think of drinking a sleeping dose ... God stops whining! I had poured in her mouth to close it! Anthony Andrews ... Lex! In view of his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he was shocked in this film. And do not make me started in Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to know if you are looking for every film Romeo and Juliet in the history of the film. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard then the current Leo and Clare!
