The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it ... or about me. It's not a good film. Terrible indeed but terrible in the way that kept my attention in such a harmful way that it resembles a tragedy and inability to look away. It was possible to have a wonderful MST3K theme! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a great movie here are fun: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, an intriguing sequence of intrigues, silly false science. You will feel the thrill of the death-death sequence, the poor victims with their rough mouths and waaaaaaaay a lot of time to think about their impending torment, facing a Muslim sudden death dramatically. Your heart will be warmed through old cliches in the scene of motion as two women fight for a gun and explode, but were they shot? Both look at himself, then the other, then himself, then (after 15 minutes apparently), one finally collapses. You will sing (with the Latin language of course) with the street fans who turn into a horrible death choir, threatened for a moment, to turn the movie into a crooked musician. <br /> <br /> So if you think I'm doing it when movies get worse, this might be a good choice for you. It's not as funny as your favorite Sci-fi movie of your favorite currently, "They Live" which features Roddy Roddy Piper, but from the scenes watching warmer movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> Give it 4 out of 10.
