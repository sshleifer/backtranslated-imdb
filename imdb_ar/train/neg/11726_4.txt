Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a killer of hire, a CIA agent, and a very bad worker. During his spare time, Dial asked for a cowboy hat and raised horses with muscular names such as Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Collins Agent, his moderator. Enter a new mission - kill a terrorist in UK custody. Of course the United Kingdom as an allied country is a great place for covert operations and bullets outside the courtrooms. <br /> <br /> Assassination is a great success regardless of the fact that the escape plan was blown up. So the Dial and Local Liaison partner is killed while trying to escape from the police, while Dial becomes a hot property where coppers in London try to reach him and the CIA attempt to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the Safe Home is routinely visited by Emily Dee (Eliza Bennett), who likes hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and helping them escape the evil British law enforcement ... < br /> <br /> script Need such a say more? On the plus side, Leslie Snipes is Wesley Snipes (whether it's a pro or an impostor) and the film is impressive. The incomplete editing is very disjointed and has the effect of shedding on the stomach.
