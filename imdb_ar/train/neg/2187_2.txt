I bought this movie on DVD so I could get a link from the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Thankfully, Mike, Crowe and Tom Cervo are watchable, because the film itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story one can follow, and a few actors that can work, there is nothing else. The film was very boring, I strongly stressed that I would not see it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As described above, it was better than the film that appeared in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
