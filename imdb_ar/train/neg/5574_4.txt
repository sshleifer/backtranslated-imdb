"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is an ideal example of how to destroy a fascinating idea of ​​pathetic subjects such as false patriotism. Here, future travelers try to destroy Japan, replacing local hero Ghadzilla with their puppy monster, the Golden Dragon with three heads, King Guidora. They failed, but in the end Godzilla fights an insidiousness. The battles between the two giants are very impressive, but the plot of the film is full of holes and everything about "Fantastic Japan" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten to respect Japan's enemies, making them stupid, stupid brothers, easily dominated by clever Japanese. The good thing is that Godzilla and King Guidora in the end almost destroyed both Japan and ridiculously enemies in one of the most spectacular battles. But even this royal battle, the film was boring and really pathetic.
