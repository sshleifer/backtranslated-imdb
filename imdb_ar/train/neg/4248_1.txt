This film was written about mediocrity, laziness and thought. If you're going to make a movie about vampires that has already been done thousands of times, it's better to do a good job well. I will be the first to say that this film has not been interrupted. Some horror / horror films fail to break a mold "lets do something forbidden and abandoned for pleasure because all stories are lies." This, unfortunately, was not different, and like all scary movies, once your adventure on this path will not be back there. <br /> <br /> The end? How do heroes do the same job over and over again throughout the film, but then they are obsessed with finishing the moment and can not do the job in the end? The end was very hostile to the climate and the glowing part 3 that I would never see. Awesome movie.
