He is puzzled how this film was nominated for seven Oscar Awards and won one prize. Not because it is bad or because, given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it, they should really deserve it, but because in each category they have been nominated for honor awards. Some may argue that Hollywood pioneer John Houston lost it at this stage of his career but I do not buy it. Just the year before, he signed his magnificent signature under The VOLCANO, a dark-colored study prepared in Mexico, one of his best ever. On the other hand, Prizzi's Honor, a movie full of stars, good intentions and graffiti, proves to be a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The tone and the general plot of gangs in love with a female playing the bright man were Hollywood's exotic formations in the early 1990s, but the script is highly ambiguous for its own sake, motives are dead, and the story seems uncertain What you are trying to be exactly: romantic comedy, criminal drama, epic bands etc. Jack Nicholson (the Brooklyn accent works perfectly with De Niro but seems unconvinced by Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in a salary position, just passing through the movements almost asleep their way through some parts. On the other hand, Angelica Houston has performed better, but her performance is sabotaged by her personality: she is the victim of her father's disdainful disdain, proving that she supports her ex-husband, and then becomes a revenge dog who wants his head to be a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film are of washed quality as they were in the early 1970s, and Huston's direction is as uninterested as anything else. There are promises behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a hungry director to admit that it could have been turned into something better, but what remains is like a film no one really cares about.
