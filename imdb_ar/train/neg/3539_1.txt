The first two films from Richie were fantastic, stylish entertainment. Here, raided two modern classic? "Usual suspects" and "fighting club" ?? And still comes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Although he considered himself a mystery (with the usual semi-suspects "the biggest trick he ever pulled was to convince you that you were" or whatever ...) and try to twist the "fighting club" around Real characters and any internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in the second half. By the last third, you know you are driving to a blind alley, and very slowly in it. <br /> <br /> Negatives, chess theory and games are fantastic subjects, but Richie examines them very superficially, so frequently that they do not benefit much from the materials. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps watching the movie (almost) is the bold Ritchie mode with the scene and the dynamic Morris Jones camera. If Ritchie sticks to a more pleasing plot, and gives in to a more radical liberalization, there is no reason why he can not create another interesting gangster. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Lack of understanding does not equal depth. If you want to see a wonderful film meaningless logical but has a virtue (incidentally, which also includes an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) witness the "Lost Highway".
