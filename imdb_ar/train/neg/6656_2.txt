This gets two because I loved it as a child, but it became so unnecessary that I just started to hate it ... I can not give this descriptive review because it will emphasize one thing after another and probably will not say anything that no one else has said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing in this show is that it is very bad, with a child who boils up to the crooked nursery to the stupidity that revolves around him. I have a cousin who likes this show and is the strangest and most stupid person I met. This offer must be withdrawn from the air. It's always the same again and again ... they need to make better offers on Nick. I've really tired of things like this.
