I had been given this movie 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. Performance of Claudine Pareto. It will take this time to overlook that Chris Aquino is here. And finally. <br /> <br /> I avoid watching Pinoy horror movies because the stories lack authenticity and I really think that some (writers) do not pay enough attention to characters (and evolution) in their stories (redundant?) stories. It was as if they had "pushed" the film onward when their storytelling was widespread. To my satisfaction, creative exhaustion has led to the penetration of other films. why?? Why did this film get a good rating? I will not give it much merit. The film was scary, but the film looked even more horrific because it deals with Philippine folklore ... it enters the category of "Likely to Happen". I wished they had spent more time improving the story lines and fixing these previous flash sequences, regardless of whether the lighting is absorbent, I would not care much if the content might blow you away .. SAYANG.
