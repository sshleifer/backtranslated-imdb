<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity in my movie program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my description line, it was a humorous, trivial, trivial and highly important. I consider myself a fan of the film, and all the things the film offers. If I want to watch a documentary at Cannes, I'll see A & E .... and maybe they're more objective. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, this period. <br /> <br />
