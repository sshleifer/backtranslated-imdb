Fred Claus somehow avoids becoming Santa Claus this year by enjoying more entertaining moments than Tim Allen, but that does not mean he has had enough to deserve a trip to the theater. <br /> <br /> As holiday films approach, they are open and emotional. But in fact, this could be less worrying than Fred Claus, who boasts of David Dobkin ("The Shanghai Knights" and "The Wedding of the Critters") on his head, and contains a really funny moment of fire as the line between Vince Vaughn poor car and muffled Christmas movie. In the end, does not represent much of the two. With a cast of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weiss, and Cathy Bates, it leaves one feeling disappointed. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays the role of Fred and Nick (Giamatti), his older and disorganized brother, once, leaving him and his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after they had enough to tolerate his parents' favoritism to his younger brothers. Nick grows up to be Santa Claus (and as the voice tells us, freezes time for you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred Rejo Ribo of Juliet becomes in Chicago having trouble remembering his girlfriend Wanda's birthday. <br /> <br /> He has a problem with the law, and he had to contact his younger brother (who looks scary to him for at least a decade) to save him from prison. Nick agrees but only if Fred agrees to help with the Arctic gaming business. Fred agrees reluctantly, but his pessimism clashes with Santa Claus and the ever-pleasing nature, even as the Spacey expert checks the operations of the toy factory and is very happy to close the entire Arctic if things fail. /> <br /> The film, it is said, has its moments, but the length of the padded running stretches it thin throughout its duration. In the piles of cinematic cliches that have been better dealt with, for example, "Elf" and attempts to feel affectionate like fruit cakes last year. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, brings his coarse charm. To the table, but Dan Vogelman's puzzling scenario prevents him from actually doing anything. Giamati, under his bad fat suit, brings a wonderful old charm to his character, but unfortunately, he has to play Fred's second violin. Spacey brings his face into the game, but his role usually ends up as disgusting. <br /> <br /> In the end, Fred Claus becomes a forgotten film falling below what participants deserve. Sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly much better ways.
