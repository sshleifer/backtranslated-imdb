There are times when you finish a movie and one wishes to get a refund for the time you just spend. This was one of those times. I almost gave up leaving only 15 minutes to bear ... I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The pace that a man goes from a straight life, controlled to one of complete spinelessness and can not be held responsible for the speed. <br /> <br /> From the graduation ceremony to the expected end of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) that allows a man of par excellence and culture to seduce himself by a woman, violence, and by changing the mind material. Of course, the women's part can be understood when observing the beautiful April talents (Natalie Kelly). But it is hard to understand the philosophy versus one penny of drugs, violence and dedication to someone I've just met. <br /> <br /> Frankly, besides his ability to stare at Natalie Kelly and Monika Keena, this film has no ransom qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do anything else ...
