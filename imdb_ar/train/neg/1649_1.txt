Every Sunday, three buds meet in a restaurant in New York City to boast of their sexual overtures the night before. Sometimes they are joined by a former companion and newly married to the Houchi and attached to it like an oscilloscope. They are horny dogs / corn dogs, and Mia, who sees them on burrows, decides she needs to learn the lesson. I hope, it will date and unload - why not? All three of them! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a Gal, Naughty Gal. Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want. As far as men do, even! <br /> <br /> There is one laughable element in the "skin" - the fact that it is not once, during Amigo's detailed discussions about her physical functions and tantric talents for the bedridden partners who rubbish, that other customers at dinner turn around and say : "Dude, we try to eat here." In fact, Hee Gap, has an elderly lady eager to have sexual characteristics useful to some drinks. A Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" is so fat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that a friend film with a wonderful setting, a clever and nice heroine and three potential couples had to have such a cop. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 Sound effects "whip-oosh" for the scriptwriter to use the phrase "Go, girl." It was tired in 2000, and it's getting tired now. <br /> <br /> Save time and see some restarts of "Sex and the City" ...
