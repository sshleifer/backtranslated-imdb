I've made this show (I've only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes / interviews seem to have failed. Some are not quite funny, but some laugh - in a 12-year-old boy's way. She reminds me of that New York painter who paints on canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman rejects what she got, including the kitchen sink, while praying that some things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different. <br /> <br /> However, what I "get" often is not enough, as if it lacks the type of follow-up that a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The entire project looks like an expired potato.
