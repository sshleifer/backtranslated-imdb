** The spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This is a single BAD movie. seriously. Acting in a very awful situation, FX is awesome and the plot down is awful right. But hey, so bad that fun watching! The script is very bad that fun! You just have to cringe and laugh at lines like "I think that's what you call CROCTEASING." Women also flashed their chests at the crocodile. COME means ON that's why her funny is so bad! She has such terrible jokes that she's funny! But after a while it's just turning the film into nonsense. I really started falling asleep. Trust me though, the plastic crocodile foot that seals on the leaves and the continuous edges of the pottery tail makes you laugh for a long time. Although I must say it was a wonderful part when the crocodile ripped this dude into two halves and hung there for a short while to figure out what to do. Hee heh a reckless film, which was nominated for the MST3K line !!
