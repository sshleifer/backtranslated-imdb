After reading several reviews, I do not know the film that some people were watching, but it was clearly not the same as the one I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Acting, primarily Moore, is terrible. Women can not act. Nice breasts, but she just can not act. At any given time, she was not discovered to be her real character. Instead, she was a pampered Hollywood actress going to the beach to play with the boys. <br /> <br /> This is what this movie ultimately considers Hollywood. Training sequence on top. Politics - on top. Political correctness - above the top. Fighting scenes - I guessed it, on top. Your task is to go in and out without being detected. so, what are you doing? Why shoot as many courses as possible and make as much noise as possible, of course. Hey Jie Jin, you can be my wing man at any time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but once you get Hollywood on this game, we end up with Top Gun in the breast. <br /> <br /> What is more than expected from American commercial films anymore? Not much think.
