A movie makes you want to throw yourself with the sword. I have seen a schlock in my time but after watching the miserable mess I do not think I can watch another movie again. God has mercy on the souls that have done this. <br /> <br /> Hypothesis - an ex-lover of the army, a figure of underwear (actually good behavior) looking for a girl who sent him a Christmas card while serving in the army. Landing with her family of granola living in the cabin who record the logging of right-wing trees. The family takes him and it takes two hours of our time to see the chick better off of its liberal appearance, drinking French wine, driving a Porsche and talking through the noisy cell phone, the dirty and staining of the city and the Jewish preacher. > <br /> 1d bad characters, 1D themes. His head is overcome with the pro-army idea. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. it has finished.
