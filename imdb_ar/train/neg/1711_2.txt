Well, I've bought the Zombie Bloodbath Trick that it would be damn fun. That's what it is, without fun. This film is really reckless, it is absent from any plot or personal development, or any kind of story story. The main problem in this film is murder and injustice. Basically, each killing looks exactly the same. ZOmbies tear someone up. Yes, that's good, but you need some original killings as well. I mean, it's really lame. Every killing looks exactly the same, and it's shot exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love Gore, and the predominance in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No story, just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person. I wanted to like this movie too. I love photography on gore videos ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not laugh at myself. This movie has good points, but none of them are in the film. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped flood and there were more than 100 zombies, which is very cool how many people participated and helped the world. But in general, this is a terrible film.
