This film relates to the unnamed species (aesthetically and sexually) that seem unable to resist basic romantic needs. Despite the participation of some outstanding players, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on childish text that relies almost entirely on intelligent dialogue; this is not the case. Nixon's role has the best lines, but they often absorb them very quickly, a flaw in the timing the director must endure. The gruesome climax uses every vulgar available, whether or not, and ends this grim attempt at comedy.
