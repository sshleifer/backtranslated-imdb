I've tried to watch this show many times, but for a show called "The Seventies Show," I do not find much about some of the hairstyles and the disco cross-references that actually call for the 1970s - the decade they grew up. Of the episodes I have seen, most plots and jokes can be set at any time period. Take a novelty (supposed) to set it in the seventies, and the presentation is neither fun nor funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a presentation that successfully represents the most youthful experience in America in the seventies, in my humble opinion, you can not do better than Wonderland Years.
