As a great fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The glowing decor and lighted collections cruelly steals any style of this new version. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of many television films in the 1970s. Crenna is not a bad choice like Walter Neff, but his luxurious wardrobe and his "mega" apartment do not match the original mood, or make him an interesting figure. He does his best to make it a success but Samantha Egger is really a bad choice. The English accents and California look unable to carry candles to the attractive Barbara Stanwyck Velvet voice and sex. Lee J.Cobb tries to design Barton Keys hard, but even his performance is just brave, unthinkable. <br /> <br /> It looks like a TV movie that reminds me and again with a wonderful still original film.
