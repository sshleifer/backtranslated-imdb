I watched this movie last night, and as a person who had very low expectations at first, he was still disappointed. The most obvious error in the film abomination is that the main plot point (the man who was awake during surgery) has nothing to do with the result. It would end the same way regardless. So, what was the purpose of this? Who do you know? Also, this surgeon had 4 lawsuits against misconduct and did not think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is quite talented and Christians are very bad. It was all funny from start to finish. I am quite sure that if you feel that someone is piercing your chest with a scalpel, it will be more than that.
