Some praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for adult thinking. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests the beginning of a direct film, that hits someone with a kind of waste that you can not sell to adults anymore. The "Crack Team" has been performed for many of the old adventure films well before (think of The Dirty Dozen_) but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst films in this idea. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member brings out seems familiar and embarrassing at best. A man of medicine / medicine, a mechanic who was stripped of his father always wanted sons, and if we have not seen them at least before, we have seen mixed and mixed dodgers before. The story is about how one companion, the role of Finney, played by Don Novello (Father Guido Sardocchi), moved from flower shops to completely unprovoked demolition. <br /> <br /> The only major character, Milo Thatch, a young obsessed academic at Atlas expressed by Michael J. Fox, has no depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues to search for his grandfather. The opening scene shows the younger Milo who floats on his knees, because his grandfather puts his head helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> While the characters were high at best, it was the best part about _Allantis_ sound talent. Perhaps Milo's depth is not thicker than Fox's magic. Commander Rourke does not lose anything expressed by James Garner. Although Rourke is a great military type, Garner shows his ability to convey the spirit of characters simply by handing him over. Garner's acoustic performance is a high point. I regret to say that "the death of Leonard Nemoy" is no more than compulsory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vini Santorini, was also prominent for one or two well-known funny lines - but I've always loved Father Guido Sardoche, anyway. <br /> <br /> Computer animation has also been done. Animated background, that is. The animations of the character have not been bad for Disney since its simplicity that pushed Don Bluth out of the door. Animations for characters do nothing if they do not make the flat letters appear even more flattering. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say a hacker or a cliche. I'm not sure about that. Any serviceable piece can be converted into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often began a well-known story and plot and was famous only for putting a new layer of paint. So the treatment is the thing. Obviously, _Atlantis_ lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can not start entering all the logical gaps without the spoiler partition. The plot was bad. Conspiracy bridges pick up like a twig and a meaningless ending. To add to that, the script intersperses and animates a few nagging. First, when Milo reveals that Runes or Celtic symbols have been misinterpreted and that "Ireland's coast" should read "Coast Iceland ", we begin to face problems. The scriptwriter will need to know that the Britons are taking Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignoring the Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know the Viking plot to call Iceland Green Island and Greenland Island. <br /> <br /> By making it a question of "speech" that is not misinterpreted, the book was ordered to request a roman version of English and a post Roman date in the script. Because this is a long time after Atlantis sinking into its cave under the sea. Without clear evidence and less technology than Milo had, it would make the inscription less trustworthy. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard's magazine can not be written before Atlantis sinks, or it will not know anything about the cave or crystal lying "in the king's eye". It must have been written after the sinking, but even without the technology that Milo's mission had, how did anyone get by Liviatan. So how can you learn more about anything then? Why would it be written in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> These things can explain automatic writing, foresight, or stellar travel. However the clairvoyance does not require travel and the astral shepherd to write in the Atlantic. Therefore, the type of type must be automatic. Since no one left at Atlantis can read, the spirit of crystalline messages of inspiration must be on the surface. This would be more logical. But it can also be explained in the film: Milo could have discovered that this force had been calling him all his life - appeared in dreams, and so forth. You should explore this in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlants must not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects that the original Indo-Europeans will be able to speak in Europe. Now the Romans will understand that "hard" or that their day has become French "ch" (pronounced like "sh", no less!) <br /> 4. The present Atlantians were alive before this catastrophe - when they seem to be able to read, but are now unable to read what they are used to, or to operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Collective illiteracy points to a critical flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. He looks suspended in the air so that Milo can save him. Although life is not always a struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or write novels, and perhaps a combination of Atlantic school systems that are heading towards the end and the lack of good imagination that caused the fall of Atlantis illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Keda's excuse for not knowing how to read or operate the mechanism if it is too small when the disaster started stupid - but any of these ** seriously ** qualifies her father to hallucinate !! Kashakim's folly wiped out his people alone. He killed a group of tragedy, progress stopped (not much was killed here, but he oversaw a huge slice of culture and progress) so someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if it was not boiled in the lava first because Giant Robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The blue lightning bolt was supposed to have smashed the quasi-Kashakim, when Kida tried to bring her father's image into the circle of great kings in Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Although Milo was the only person who was able to read the Atlantic language, Rourke and others knew enough to look at a book of jargon and found a page on a crystal - he knew it was crystal and not Some astrological mines or "phases of the sun" graph. <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about the subject, he did not explain how Rourke suffered from reading Milo as part of the book. The tearing of the page - which was idle in Rourke's hand, although Milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently - was only to drive the viewer out that "something was not quite right." Unless the word "crystal" ignited warnings in the head of Milo and someone tried to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything. It's just a thick prediction. <br /> <br /> 8. The crew "Double Cross" was not changing character. We learned that Finney, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie were walking alongside Rourke from the start. However, the "change of heart" falls. It was a change, and it was necessary to have better motivation. Difficult to do with characters that did not give anything to start with. <br /> <br /> 9. Little grumble that the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we see from the sequence. It is liquid; it will not flow on the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. Endings are over! - It is only logical to appease political correctness. With its power source restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak force, needing codification. Parents of giant robots and sky cycles that make lightning blue indicate that what they fear is less than they might fear. This technology is superior to our technology, and certainly to the early twentieth century. In the end, Milo needs to teach the Atlanteans to read, why? The whole idea is to leave their small quiet culture alone, not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps you should give me a Lost World plot and prepare this century for hinting that this is the most cherished tribute. The failure I find in the film is consistent with this idea. But I am puzzled why I have to pay to see high figures and plot loopholes just because so many Daim novels have. The pulp stories are part of the "crap they can not sell adults anymore", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our son needs to grow up too. The Lost Ark did not lose any feeling of pulp and avoided much of the damage. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is fun, but I'm thinking about the plot, leaking constantly.
