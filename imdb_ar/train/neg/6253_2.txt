Not a very good film, but according to the information, it is very accurate in the portrayal of torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of NK POW camps and this is done effectively enough, with a sudden frankness at the time. Whatever the technical flaws are (and many are) watching, you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some bad things - again, bad because they are being implemented north of the DMZ and not at Guantanamo Bay. <br /> <br /> I do not think any of the Korean veterans raised his torture while running for president, if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to Vietnam movies. I do not know if people in 54 are trapped in the concepts of World War II (boys tend to wisdom a lot) or war or what, but it is interesting to see this from the same system that will be after 16 years making films like "Go Tell The Spartans" .
