"Witchery" may be the most inconspicuous and most prominent horror film of the 1980s, but fortunately it has some countervailing qualities such as wonderful effects, great musical score and some amazing, amazing choices. Faithfully, the scenario does not make a single atom of meaning, but who cares when Linda Blair (a hairstyle) imagines another girl possessed by evil powers, and David Hasselhoff depicts a tremendous photographer (seemingly not put) film constantly showing voodoo blood and lips stitched, On the heels of steel, fierce burns and excessive use of melody but really creepy. Eight people gathered randomly on a deserted resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The two young couples are there to explore the history of the dark place; the dilapidated family (with Linda Blair pregnant, although no one seems to be bothered by his father and whereabouts) is simply re-opening the hotel and the architect is simply marked for casual sex. They are forced to stay at night in a dilapidated hotel and then suddenly the former owner ?? Represented by aging or something always dressed in black? They start out in different ways. Everything is linked in one way or another to the sequence that shows that a woman accused of magic jumps out the window. In any case, the plot is certainly of minor importance in the Italian horror franchise which began as an informal show of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing and the effects of make-up are undoubtedly the most outstanding element in the entire film. There is something very obsessed and distraught about staring at an unarmed woman hanging upside down in a chimney and waiting to be fry.
