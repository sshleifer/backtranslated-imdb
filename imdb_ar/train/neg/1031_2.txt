This film is one chiche long after the other. First of all, though they do their share, there is an unwarranted narcotic scene where John sniffs like a fool. Wigs and accents are awful. It looks worse then the old Beatles comics. John is a bad, gay, gay wardrobe, and a slave to Yoko and imagines that in the book Albert Goldman is doubtful. They even continued to release songs in a regular conversation. "He's always been just two of us!" John did not mean to his fans like this too. Like his death he showed us that he was very nice if anything. The only funny scene is that one of the Beatles' expensive fans gets to know John and ask him to sing Paul yesterday. John Mahan says something like "Certainly, while I was wondering why you do not get down on your knees and wear your wife's wig and lick my ribs." This made me laugh for several days. Really this funny film in how seriously he tries to be silly while off. John and Paul did not sit all day long, eager and enthusiastic, even during the disintegration of the Beatles, where they were filmed here much more. forget that.
