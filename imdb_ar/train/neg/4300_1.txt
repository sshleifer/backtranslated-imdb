Buford's Beach Bunnies gives B & T a bad name. As a fan of this genre, I was amazed to find a few attempts to exploit the talents of the young actress. I refer specifically to the apparent lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is the next generation of sad teenage boys who watch this on late-night television supposed to think about?
