There is not much to say about this film, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Representation and dialogue are inescapable, and the story of the hybrid wolf is not well illustrated and it all contains plot openings here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you do not want to see. He is so amateurish that he makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was in the plugins. Gasket roller. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope nobody buys this, it does not even deserve leasing. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
