The brides die on the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is interested, but no one seems to know why this is happening, and how it can not prevent it from happening. Carry with me. Bella Lugosi is responsible for this, as he extracts the spinal fluid from these young women to transport his old wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities discover that someone must design deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can not detect an unlikely motive. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudo-science and go ahead ... If you can get through the first 20 minutes of this mess, you will be treated with Lugosi, who is flogging his lab assistant because he does not respect one of the brides he killed, explaining that he is sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than Bed, and other mysterious parodies of real horror movies (genre with budgets and conspiracies). Anyhoo - a journalist tracking her nose to the culprit (and strikingly that the police are inefficient can not see it anywhere!), Then start really fun. <br /> <br /> Cinema and photography is fine. There are a lot of people who are well dressed, very well-dressed in this film. The steering is fair, and the script is slightly better than the due material. However, this film failed to maintain everyone's attention except for the b-film's most rigid fan. Best of all .... It ends in the end, but not soon.
