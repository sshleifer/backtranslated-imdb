I did not see the original version, but I just wanted to drop a quick note for anyone who happens to scroll down this way: Wicker Man is the worst movie I have seen this year. Maybe even within two years. I hope to ask the theater to refund my money or return time to warn myself not to see it. <br /> <br /> I'll give him two positive gestures: the cynicism of Cage's character at least I laughed at some of me and the island scene was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes the jokes. The plot of the film is pushed forward only because the other characters will not give Cage any direct answers - and it begs this !!! How can this last for more than an hour of my time (much less in the film) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. Leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill the library. How can anyone read this text and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shady scheme of what the film should look like" outside of me. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this click. Or even rent them on a DVD.
