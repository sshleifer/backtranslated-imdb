Most of the action films from Hindi movies, especially Sunny and his family <br /> <br /> The movie is a typical Sunny type that contains hamburgers, big dialogues and melodrama <br /> <br /> The film also contains Rajiv Rai components for many followers And a strange villain <br /> <br /> The beginning is fine and then moving to Kenya is good but then the film continues and continues <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace and nothing great happens. > Many stupid scenes such as Kenyan policemen appear like the sharks, especially Sharat <br /> <br /> The peak is too long <br /> Rajiv Ray does a good job Music is fine, As always, Chunky acts like a monkey during his own laughable scenes, and is so good that the heroines are pure wood. Ameryh Puri is not even half as scary as TRIDEV and the rest is on Okay
