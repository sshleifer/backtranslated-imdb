The only reason I have not made this reason is because Sibble shows that he is skilled in the technical aspects of film making. It's a technically skillful film. <br /> <br /> Having said this, it is a film based on lies and distortions that are easily refuted. Most of the documentary is spent using advertising techniques to hit the space program, rather than reality. The "irrefutable evidence" of Sibrel that the landing processes were fakes are easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, check it out on google video for free. Do not let Bart Seabril take advantage of your curiosity.
