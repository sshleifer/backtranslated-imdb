The only film I came out of. Amazing, since I paid for myself and my history and I really cheap. But my mind is no longer able to stand on the ground where I have accumulated, especially as I have written funnier material while linking and ruling. <br /> <br /> This movie offends from start to finish. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and certainly not funny now. But even worse, this film marks the beginning of the end of the truly sophisticated comedy. It's an event, the script and the ideas began in an epoch era (which remains to this day) where cheap laughter and sexual innuendo dominate the comedy culture of the film. <br /> <br /> The Olympic Games? What high school kid did not think about it? Beginning of the End.
