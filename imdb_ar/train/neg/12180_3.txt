This film is very awful, but nevertheless, it can be a joy at times, although this humor is completely unintentional. <br /> <br /> The plot was far from being silly. I do not even think a two-year-old will be convinced by the incredible stupidity that filmmakers tried to slap together into a story. However, on the positive side, some terrible painful transformations provide a great deal of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll keep you. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally funny. Most children's roles are kind of kind, but not very reasonable. On the other hand, Annie is very awful. Adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but that's pretty good. If they tried to believe it, the film would be worse. This is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you have overcome the total madness of the film, there are actually a few moments of outstanding madness. The scene in which the son of Mrs. Hogbottom runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, although it is an annoying disappointment when they are caught by the police. The personality of a personal servant, though very small, is a ray of sunshine that penetrates the gloom almost, but never penetrates it. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie really caused me physical pain. However, there were some recovered parts that made it almost invisible without starting to bleed internally. Judging by his good parts alone, the film would be about 5; unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserves 1. So, I give it 3. <br /> <br /> I was very generous, as I said.
