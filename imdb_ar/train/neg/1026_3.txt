Wonderful. I do not think I've seen a movie before with many wonderful actors who have played an important role in this area. Justin Timberlake may be the worst single actor to have a big role in a film with stellar power and money left behind by Edison. <br /> <br /> His representation was impressive. The story was good and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, so LL Cool J was fine because he had many small parts to cut his teeth. How did the director and film company conclude that Timberlake was prepared for this role, there is no way to understand it. <br /> <br /> His character destroys the entire experience because every time he appears on the screen, you are already rooting for the corrupt police to reduce the ass sorry, he is supposed to be the hero ... I will not waste money on this one in the theater Or in the video. Maybe if you have HBO and you do not have anything else to do at 2 am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be fine. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human being "Kermit the Frog" acting in the Hollywood Blockbuster, just did not work at all.
