I watch a lot of scary films (or at least they try to be) and this should be the worst if not the second worst movie I ever had to make myself try to sit in. I never knew the depths of the cattle until I hired a rotten piece of cheese covered with contraceptives used in latex. I love Julian Sans, but this is worse than I wish him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was fascinated ... In the first minute and half the credits went up and I did not yet see how the pain looked directly. Maybe there were some viewers who enjoyed this and could guide me in the right direction, but again I know that those viewers who understand if not memory me, especially when we had to turn off the video, this simply was not done with our control (we had to make an exception One clear). <br /> <br /> If it's up to a new edition, I'll give it an opportunity as long as it contains at most 1% of its original. That's all.
