This caught on Showtime tonight, and I was amazed how a film with such an interesting assumption could end up being incredibly shocking. who is your father? Brandon Davis stars as senior high school adoptive Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to the porn empire left by his biological parents. Although the premise seems like a movie that can be a lot of fun, it's broken because of the inadequate output from first-time director Andy Fickman, a vulgar and predictable scenario, and this is badly done by live video standards. Even the funny Charlie Talbert often turns into a dismal performance suddenly as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and failed mud. 10/01
