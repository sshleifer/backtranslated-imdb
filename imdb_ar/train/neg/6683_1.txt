I'm happy because people at IMDb were able to decode the genre in which this movie is located. I had a doubt that she was trying to be a comedy, but since she seemed to want to be a dark melodrama and a painter, I was not sure. For comedy, they are surprisingly abstract even from the least adventurous in the world of humor - until the end of the absurd "twisting", which confirms what is a waste of time full of the entire film. It's hard to describe how nonsense nonsense really is. Did anyone in this film ever have any idea what they were supposed to do? In fact worth watching so you can stare at the screen at unbelievable claws over how horrible it is.
