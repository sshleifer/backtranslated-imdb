**** WARNING: Here the spoilers are **** Why do I spend years hurrying in a hurry to see garbage like this? This film is a wonderful collection of cliches, bad writing, poor output, and then we have not yet come to acting. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can predict the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The hero is fighting against the stupid, corrupt and incompetent followers. One of the avalanches collapses, burying all the heroes who somehow managed to survive despite the passage of all kinds of cliffhanger hazards. He gets fried a rotten partner who caused everything alive with his bonus money. The second collapse deviated heroically through the experience of the rebellious rebel expert. Evil followers eventually turn to heart as well. The troubled teenager is in the arms of her cruel father's wife after she saved her. Etc, etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is good reason to warn of spoilers. Maybe you can make the entire chart if you're given the basic components. At least, I was not far from the mark most of the time and I expected what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Then we did not discuss the real mistakes. <br /> <br /> I agree with a former commentator that although there are some features that recover their value even in a bad movie. You will be heavily pressed to find anything in this. I suppose I gave it 2 out of 10 in some great shots, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since the movie made me whine, but it certainly happened.
