Lovers of feature films have to endure a lot of horrible movies lately. Blood Surf unhesitatingly joins the list of stupid stupid horror titles about the big, ironic animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles were especially successful where we had already struggled on our way through the deep "crocodiles" (produced by the disappointing Tobe Hooper) and "Lake Placid". Blood Surf Everything bad like these other movies ?? Furthermore it? He likes to exaggerate dramatically. The saltwater crocodile is assumed to be 90 years old and has a length of 30 feet! During the film, he entertains himself by devouring a group of men with luggage and passengers who have come looking for new excitement by browsing in a shark-filled area. The only nice aspect about this film is the tropical location. Although it is a place quite unsuitable for a film like this, only the lakes and nature look fantastic. Every other side is simply catastrophic. There is a lot of unfairness but everything seems fake and funny. Conversations are painfully blunt to listen to! You will not believe some of the lines that these actors should say! I know that the surfers of this group are supposed to be mentally retarded, but I hope they are stupid! Early in the film, one character refers to the Jaws as a "mechanical game," but the crocodile appears ten times smaller than the big white shark in Spielberg. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateur and the massacres have failed to influence. I will not say much about acting because it is secondary in such clicks. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and flutter with joy as they run away from the beast. You think correctly: Blood Surf is a very bad film. Too bad it becomes fun again. But "funny" for a reason other than James Hickox intended.
