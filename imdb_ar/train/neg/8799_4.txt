Glory to patience Paul Moni, who spent hours and hours in the make-up room every day to look like Zola's part. Mony was one of the greatest stars of the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today - more than classical movie aficionados - know about it. He was a giant at work for at least ten years. He could have won the Oscars for this performance, which he would have given him two straight, because he won the Louis Pasteur Prize the previous year. My personal opinion is that while he was inclined to exaggerate a bit, I still think he was one of the greatest actors in the Golden Age. No matter what part it played, it split into the screen you're watching. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pastor, I thought that this story struck a lot more than we have seen in the past 60 years: going to the Liberal Ship Champion. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its disdain for the police or the army, making it a point to tell us how corrupt those organizations were. Filmmakers like it when power is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film is ahead of its day since we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts support this story. Nor does it in any way diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer and remove some evils. Good for him! I hope they have spent more time showing it, rather than focusing on one experience.
