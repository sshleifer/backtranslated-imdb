Hey man, how low serials went down by 1952! This boring thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoys Annie Wilkes (from misery). Not only do heroes escape from traps by adding scenes that did not exist in the previous chapter (and maybe they can not be there - tell me that when the bad guys blow up in Episode 7 to 8 they will not see the characters jump), but I think this series contains a record Stock shots in the world. I mean, more than that is stock footage! And not just from other series (it seems that all the sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the brilliant "rock" scenes from Episode 2 to 3 are from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from the same! The entire "journey to the moon" series (which is probably the shortest of all, 30 seconds and the characters do not seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) is repeated from Episode 1 in Episode 8! Episode 10 is all the scenes from previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K never rings 10, 11 and 12? Well, they've stopped working after 9 so they do not have to do everything again!). <br /> <br /> I began to work in science. Get ready to see the brightest moon ever! And moon men who can not breathe on their world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, it will be very clean, and stunts (usually the best in serials) are few and far between. Visually, am I the only person who thinks that a Cody commando helmet shaped like a bullet (or is it a lemon shaped) looks very silly? Rocketeer's was cooler, no matter how bad the film was (and the guy was, awful). The tank-like car is not much better, it looks like a group of kids made it on Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the role of the hero is my home instead of the usual piece of muscle (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But he is then unattractive ... <br /> < > Not even worth watching for nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, see the "Unforgettable Marks" section to see the real woman's pearl).
