Your mind will not be satisfied with this budget budget doomsday. But, please, who will? A young couple spends the virtual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some foreigners who masquerade as people in the church. <br /> <br /> A small stroll under the title _Apocalyptically, END OF THE WORLD brilliantly and not having a Prio style of 50s similar movies. Not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid? Not only on the Day of Judgment but the monastery also crawls. The villain of the film is a representative of well-known characters. <br /> <br /> This kind of shameless, irreverent shame seems to be part of the monastery, a sort of 1970's that seems very old today. In any case, the secret laboratory of the monastery is a bad piece of future decor! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world. But the end of the world is not at all his pride!
