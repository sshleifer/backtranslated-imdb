<br /> <br /> I am a fan of horror / sci-fi regardless of budget, but after watching countless late-night horror movies on cable and video, this must be the worst in all movies. With special bloody effects (like a barbecue covered with blood or ketchup that has been shown over and over again) and people running screaming from the left, then to the right, then back again. I had to stay with the scenery of the start shop and stop there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, they are dragged long. It is a very low budget x5 too. Many scenes were too long. The narrator seemed very amateurish as a random person from the top novice he was talking. This is the only film I have seen less than Manus, Reed Zoba Cuba, Benji, and Gedzilla versus Miguel, despite their higher budgets. 10 nap, try to stay awake throughout the entire movie in one place or better, avoid it as if you were a mob eating brains. Why have not I ever done this, see this piece of zombie Ruth Blues. Examples of bad movies are nausea and so on. No final. -infinity / 10
