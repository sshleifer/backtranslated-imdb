I watched this film during a class under Tolkien during my second year. I was sitting sadly close to the screen and my teacher chose me to work as a leather boy - everyone was laughing, but they were not in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's get out of him: Peter Jackson's films "The Lord of the Rings" owe something to the film "Bakshi". In the Jackson version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which Black Riders attacks the empty bedside mattress is a full carbon version of the scene in Bakshi, shot. You can call this impersonation or greeting, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I will not do any research to find out what these things are, because that means I have some respect for this film. I'm sure others have outlined similarities - look around you. <br /> <br /> This movie is the wreckage of a train full of meaning from the metaphor, and many people died in the accident. I've decided to include what I can remember in one way or another in chronological order - if I leave anything else wrong, it's because I'm completely overwhelmed and I'm rich in failure (and at high points, poor). <br /> <br /> * Because of the intense use of endoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a gentle and wise therapist, but an annoying Prophet of Satan (his hat changes color unintentionally during the movie's time). <br /> <br /> Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as "Aruman" during the film, without explanation. Wearing purple and red color for mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> Sam is obnoxious. His friendship with Frodo is strangely strange and unsatisfactory. Yes, the hobbit is as small as the children, but they are not children. <br /> <br /> Merry and Pippin are never presented - they simply appear while changing the scene with a one-sentence explanation. The movie is filled with such dirty editing. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam and Sam Pippin sing bitterly as they walk the way. One of the hobbies collects the lute at least twice its size behind his back - which was not visible before - and begins to play in a typical fictional poet style where they all spread to "la la la". Wonderful. <br /> <br /> It seems that Aragorn is an Native American wearing a very fanciful vest (no panties), with a huge belt buckle for the belt. It can be said that he is the worst fencer in the entire film - often swinging in front of him frantically before knocking on his ass. <br /> <br /> Black Riders look more like leprosy than the threat of evil tools. They limp everywhere they go at a slow painful pace. This is definitely annoying, but not scary. <br /> <br /> Scene Before Black Riders try to cross the Ford of Bruinen (where Frodo's gaze, which is on the other side on horseback) continues forever, during this time the riders ride their horses in a mysterious threat and .. They do not do anything else. The scene may have been intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinations and he succumbed to his wound. It turned out to be more than anything else. <br /> <br /> Gimli the Dwarf is tall like Legolas the Elf. He's a dwarf. There is simply no excuse for that. It also looks like David the Gnome. It is a preliminary but accurate description. <br /> <br /> Boromir appears to have stolen the golden viking armor from Elmer Foud from the Bugs Bunny episode. It seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity with the Tolkien illustration, Balrog incites the least threatening mites and villains in the entire film. It looks like a person wearing a pink bedroom slipper, barely to be taller than Gandalf. "Puritans" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's copy any day. <br /> <br /> * The battle scenes are embarrassing and embarrassing. None of the characters show any level of proficiency using their weapons. I do not ask scenes full of excitement like those in the Jackson movie, but they're supposed to fight. <br /> <br /> Treebeard has a very short look, and I was sorry because it bothered everyone. Watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, now for the good parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some audio representation is very good. Aragorn does not seem to look bad, he looks like Julie Green-Jiannt. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this picture; like Tom Pompil, she seems immune to the temptations of Ring, and her voice actress is not too awful. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as tense as Jackson's portrayal of the scene itself, but it is still dramatically dramatic (and more truthful when he died in the book, although I do not think Jackson made a mistake in shooting him the way that Done by). <br /> <br /> As my teacher pointed out (among the threats of whispering), the sprites (mainly in Helms-Deep, if you're right) resemble the bodies of soldiers destroyed by the war, a political statement that works well if you realize what Being attempted. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not really a positive point about the film, it can not be blamed for Bakshi's most failures in this film, or so I was told - the project was on a tight budget, and at the time The late production lost creative control over some top positions (I certainly did not read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi even if I try some time depending on this size. I simply have a hard time believing that he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this bland amendment to the classic Tolkien trilogy even for laughter, unless you have already read books and have your own perceptions of characters, places, and events. I'm sure someone, somewhere, will choose a copy of this in confusion; if you do, open your mind and find out what you can use.
