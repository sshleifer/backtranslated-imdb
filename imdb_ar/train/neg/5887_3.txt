Jane Russell has proved to be a delightful musical performer in the movie "Gentlemen prefer blondes" similarly? But, unfortunately, this film wastes those skills. There is a nice photography budget in Paris, but the film does not work. Ms. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. This leaves no one playing enough with Jane Russell. Some other players are off course. <br /> <br /> There are many embarrassing scenes; most of all, be careful: there is a number of music where African cannibals are "knocked down" in a bowl after Alan Young sings a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is interesting, and sometimes embarrassing. , A waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Mary Brownets (10/29/55) Richard Sal√© ~ Jane Russell, Jane Crane, Alan Young, Scott Brady
