I was expecting comedy like "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the film was a strange mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This movie contains three schemes: the first includes Madea and taking in a baby. The second involves a woman engaged to a wealthy man who mistreats her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There is a very small comedy in the film. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the film. For example, the baby hugges the baby with a belt (in a comic way), to persuade the child to correct. The child, in fact, turns around. It seems, useful to hit children. <br /> <br /> There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with older young men who are associated with them. (The game of ogling occurs in a family reunion.) The movie moves from plot to plot so that it is always unbalanced. Is this a comedy or a love story or a drama? It is, in fact, nothing ... only a waste of time and money.
