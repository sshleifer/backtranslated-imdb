Have you ever had a wonderful picture in your mind you think it would be nice to be in a movie: like watching the detective look through the cracks of the broken fence of some abandoned houses? Or seeing a woman walking in a street that looks cold and intense and alarmingly alarmed? Yes. Imagine that picture extends to a full movie, but you got the idea of ​​Broken, although there are no investigators in this film, but I use it only as a visual example. But the woman looking closely here has filled 99% of the screen time. I did not get anything complaining about that woman, they are an ideal choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open person, who can find pleasure in all kinds of artistic expressions, and I can really enjoy some really moody stuff. It would be really great if you could frame a scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, acting great. Some of the expressions that appear on the actors are what makes me watch. <br /> <br /> Now the problem with this movie. Out of the mood, there is nothing else here. The director basically took the idea obsession and went beyond it. I do not consider it as a spoiler if I say that mania "mirror". Let's face it, this unique idea exists all over the bloody place and that is all that the director got. Granted, there are a few twisting and moving here and there. If you have been given any attention, nothing will surprise you in the end, except for obvious conspiracies. <br /> <br /> Now, I do not choose bones with this style of art because I enjoyed it most of the time. I still think that we should judge on a technical basis the medium he uses to express what artists want to express. A movie is not a piece of music, a picture, a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a wonderful picture in your mind. All in addition to a good story and personal development. I consider Lynch's approach to cheating. They are irresponsible, cheap and wasteful to the broker. We made 2 hour movies running the movie for good reason. Therefore, we must judge it differently from the judgment frame of one of the images such as a picture or a painting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not Lynch's style, thank God. It has evolved linearly and finally came to an end. It does not have much story or personal development. She presented herself rather seriously with characters composed of ordinary people, thus distancing herself from other fantasy objects at least from the surface. Does not provide any explanation for the imaginary element and has never attempted to build a coherent world around it. The stranger came from nowhere and seemed somewhat isolated and chance. The cohesion may remain in the director's head, but I do not think he has done much to bring it to the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did he put his effort at that time? He seems to have done a lot of work in building the mood and promoting it with music. Music often accumulates tension which eventually turns into a tease. Only in the latter part of the film, embodied fear and tension. <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt like: Well, I know what you're trying to say here but that's the point you're trying to make by spending two hours building all this tension? It has nothing to do with who they are and what kind of life they have. We give very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance just taken. Disappointing but I think the director did not have much material to work with and this is obvious.
