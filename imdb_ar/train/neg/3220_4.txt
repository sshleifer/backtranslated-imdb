I absolutely hate it when the film breaks down quite near the end, having already invested it for an hour. This is what happened with this film. I am intrigued by its representatives and the fact that Malamud wrote his story source. I did not go to read this story but I do not imagine it ending as this movie ends. Luckily, I did not pay good money to see it or rent it because my library got it. Oh such a waste of excellent acting (wife in particular was very perfect). But Milo O'Shea as a Jew? !!!! Now that was funny. I did not research her making, but it looked as if the director had lost his marble or died 3/4 of the film. Before that point, there was a story and characters evolving, there were a number of exact plot points and there was not much wasted time. But this did not last for two and a half hours - if this was not the most impressive and worthless thing I have ever seen, I do not know what it is. I hate it only when the faith of the individual is destroyed in this way; it seems like a violent act.
