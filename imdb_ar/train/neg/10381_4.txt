A thrilling, haunted, American family home is found in a 200-year-old house in Japan where a triangle of violent suicide love has occurred. <br /> <br /> The Novel setting relates to the only element of interest in the very slow horror flick by the manager of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and consists of somewhat volatile scenes which rarely seem to be a leader anywhere. <br /> <br /> A clear example is a fairly early scene where the male bullets visit the temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk warned before. The monk narrates the history of the house (which the viewer already knows from the opening sequence) and then the film simply moves to something else. Earlier the monk offered help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house where things get worse and no monk is mentioned until almost the end when he comes back to do what he should have done an hour ago - try to drive spirits out of the house, although by this time it is difficult for viewers interest. <br /> <br /> There are some (perhaps) unintentional laughs in the camps to see American actors in the end become Japanese-owned and suddenly start by doing bad martial arts, and I would probably say because the scene reminds you a bit of a duel with a chainsaw from the same motel Hill "who was obviously supposed to be amused, but this is generally forgotten.
