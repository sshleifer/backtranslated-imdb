The sun was not bright, it was very wet, so I went to the cinema, that day cold and cold, wet. <br /> <br /> "Cat in the Hat" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and the kids did not need to see it, the humor was not soiled. <br /> <It was like drinking milk from a mad cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. <br /> <br /> This film, in short, is terrible. The behavior was bad, the plot was modified a lot, and the humor was surprisingly raw. <br /> <br /> Began Conrad, Sally, A breaker rule and Sherif the future. When their mother is forced to go to work, Ms. Cowan brings to babysitting. Perhaps the only funny part of the film is when Ms. Kuan sees a Taiwanese courtroom, a C-SPAN game. Quickly fall asleep, here comes Cat. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to get out of control. Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. He got the first and second thing, which suddenly began to smash the house. He quivers the TV Infomercial, accidentally slides off his tail. When the cat runs out of Carmen Miranda, it is not funny. His only funny mask might be the Hippie activist. There is a fish trying to warn the children of the cat. <br /> <br /> It is very unfortunate that he did not warn us that this movie was as enjoyable as yogurt or slicing your tail. <br /> <br /> Soon, the children are looking out for a family dog, who has a key box in his collar. If the box is not locked soon, it will be home to the Cat world. Here it becomes a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting, in general, is terrible. Mike Myers brings his brand of invincible humor to Austin Powers to Cat, where he says things like "You are dirty" and imagines himself as a woman for the rest of his life after beating him in the testicles while pretending to be Benigna. Spencer Preslin is as wonderful as the troublesome Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is as attractive as Sally, although she alone is not enough to save this heinous aorta that is waiting to kill John Ritter (an accident waiting to happen). Glamor and cute Alec Baldwin, Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, and he never tries to seduce the mother's children, played by Kelly Preston. Shawn Hayes is Mr. Humperlop, my mother's president, who is also the voice of the fish. The other three are also nice. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are a parent, I will not put my kids in a state of humor, because there are plenty of him and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As the late Dr. Suss once said, it's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore had already turned over in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says, "Strange Kill the Cat." - The Cat in the Hat * From *****
