Wow I think any Steven Seagal movie was bad. Every time I thought the film could not get worse, I proved I was wrong. The story was good but the actors could not bear it. Also, they made a lot of mistakes about how to do the proper archaeological excavations. For example, do not deal with handicrafts until they are handled. The biggest crime was casting the archaeologist girl. She was a weak actress and felt that her acting made the film less realistic then it was already. The whole concept of the temple knights being underground seemed all these years too stupid for me. I love the idea of ​​how they disappeared and things, so that looked almost depressed. I thought the characters did not explain well enough. Not much background was discovered and this made it difficult for them to connect with them.
