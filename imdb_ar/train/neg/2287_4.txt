I only watched Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donny Brasco), I do not really remember her, but she did a wonderful job as a naive girl who made pictures because she made people happy. <br /> <br /> You did not really think that what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the company and found her debt again. <br /> <br /> The pictures I gave were very reasonable according to today's standards. It's funny to see the men who have the cameras feeling thrilled, and politicians are provoking the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, Good Luck) played a great role here. <br /> <br /> She wrote an American Psycho and produced a fascinating biography of the most famous pinup girl ever.
