This chain has potential, but I think the budget will not allow it to see that potential. An interesting setting, no different from "lost" it drops after the first episode. A whole series, six episodes, could have made a spectacular 90-minute film, but filmmakers chose to continue. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the movement forward. The music was very disturbing and did not work in general. There were a few characters that we cared about because their personalities did not grow during the timeframe --- well, I grew a bit. The end was as horrific as the rest of the series. The only fame here is the art and decorating section, they have created an interesting appearance, and it was so bad that the writer and director lacked the insight to do something interesting with this element
