The movie was awesome !!! Easily the worst film I've seen in the last few years. One of these films will be able to tell people over the next three years that it was the worst film I can think of. Thank you for answering this burning question: "What's the worst movie I've ever seen?" Answer: Celestine's prophecy. I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to watch the film, but then, treat the audience as if we were swaying there is no story and the story is paralyzed by a lot of magic and chance. It is very bad for them to clarify the nine prophecies and can not simply be woven into an entertaining story to follow. They did not spend any time developing their character and it was easy not to care if any personality died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck to it until the end of this incredibly boring film. The book is very boring, but I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The movie does not offer the same opportunity and I suggest not to see it if you want to keep carrying the words of the book near your heart. Do not see this movie. Trust me.
