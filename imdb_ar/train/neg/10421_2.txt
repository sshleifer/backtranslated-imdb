I saw this movie as a very young girl (I am 27 years old) and I felt terrified for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was attracted to music (obviously) violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch him, and both of them say they will not let me watch this movie. I think they only say that I know that I have strong feelings about it; 0) I am currently reading the book (out of curiosity and the fact that it is classic) and it is a truly wonderful story. However I do not think it should have been in a caricature. Start. Well, maybe the kids these days find her strange, but she gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have trouble seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. It gives me a little bit of heart palpitations every time. Yah I wuss but I strongly suggest that any father looking to introduce this film to their children, read the book instead or watch it first to make sure they agree to the content. Not everyone finds it as troublesome as we did but there are; 0)
