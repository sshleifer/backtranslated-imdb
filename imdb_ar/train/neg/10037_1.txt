I never thought the level of movies would go down so bad! The film contains a nonsense story that does not interest you. <br /> <br /> Saif's role is over. Carina has improved her character, but she is not a good actress anyway. Akshay good Anil is also good. Did I say that the role was not good? <br /> <br /> Lots of licenses are full. He wondered if it was supposed to be the "comedy part" of the film. Just because the last few films were floundering - does this mean that Yashraj films should make this kind of trash? She has a history of a lot of good movies. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very disappointed with the film.
