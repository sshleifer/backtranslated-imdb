This movie was terrible, it was almost good ... we love musicals, but not this. Even with terrible sound quality, bad cinematography, and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rap has already managed to perform well (especially in the end). The character of Marjorie, a drunk lady, was fun to watch as well. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unpredictable and may be funny without the terrible singing and joyful piano music. It is recognized that some of the (brilliant) songs are very attractive (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is terrible! We think it might be a good musical stage (with excellent actors).
