I can not say I liked this movie very much. He has some fun moments, but he does not seem to be able to decide whether it's comedy or drama. It does not really work as if it is. It is also a light in tone to be a drama, a few amusing moments and distant. It also has little meaning. Things seem to be happening for no reason. It is also very twisted. I feel I made things as they go. If they have taken the time to explain things, this may be a better film. I would say that the end was hostile to the climate, but that may mean that the rest of the film was actually accumulating into something, never happened. It just ends, that is. I did not find it boring, but as I said, there is no point. I will give winter Kills hesitant and weak 3/10
