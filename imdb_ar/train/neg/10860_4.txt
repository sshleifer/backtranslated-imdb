This was a disappointing film for me. It was about a stuffed group called "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift from someone who knew that I usually enjoyed films that were done in this way (insisting that noir is a style rather than a kind). I do not think it's a noir movie at all. There seems to be a tendency nowadays to classify and commercialize every black and white B film produced from 1947 to 1955 as Noir, and the title is not always appropriate. There is an oppressed male protagonist, Ed Collin (Lee Gee Cobb), and most of the film's events take place indoors. These are just the only noir elements I can see. There is no rampant paranoia, or any real reason why one sympathizes with Ed Collin. Jane White was over-dressed and not as convincing as a girl. I do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers. However, I will be interested in hearing what other film experts say about this subject.
