This film is undoubtedly the worst horror film I have ever seen. That says a lot, given that I have seen such a foul smell like the Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is second only). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really came out. Sometimes, there is nothing more entertaining than a slippery flick. For this film, the opening scene in which a woman is exposed to a frying pan in a tanning room seems to have no effect on the film at all, especially since the film fails to tell you that the event happened two years before the rest of the film. Representation does not exist, and most camera shots are from shrinking women's areas wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most ardent actor in the face of the stone. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be the murder weapon. Giant safety pin ?! As they were thinking? Who is the killer? Employee "Huggies" disgruntled? I had to give this film zero years, but I dared if I did not have an explosion to watch
