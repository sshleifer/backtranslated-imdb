As often, films about self-hate characters do not make a good drama. "Nancy Download" is no exception. It is supposed to be based on a true story of a woman killed on her request by someone she meets online. <br /> <br /> The hero is Nancy (Maria Bello) and is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful golf developer who his company has successfully marketed to many bars and restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has no positive traits (except his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a dark and expressive expression on his face. He does not sympathize with his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to prostitutes. When she asks his wife about sex, she is punished by masturbation in her lap instead. <br /> <br /> Nancy is just as much a character. She did not just have a 15-year-old girl without love, but was sexually abused by her uncle when she grew up (fortunately, there are no memories of that back story in the film). Her self-hatred takes the form of self-mutilation and as a result, she is forced to treat. However, she has despised her therapist so much that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy feels so depressed that she communicates with Lewis online. It is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo, who fucked with women for money with a lot of pain attached to the boots. It has been revealed that Lewis has two children but no longer sees him (no longer the mother of children want anything to do with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is first to have a painful sex with Lewis and then make him kill her. There is a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis exercises sex with Nancy as she penetrates the vagina area with a broken glass. These scenes are reminiscent of Lewis's visit to Albert, who links him to the golf club. Lewis seems to have a two-pronged plan to see Albert: 1) stabs him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) enjoys the beating he receives. It takes some time before Louis reveals Nancy's fate? First, Albert is forced to do in favor of taking his dog to a relative so that someone will care about him in the future. Nancy's fate, of course, is that Lewis ended up strangling her to death (but he showed some reluctance first because he made it clear that he had some "feelings" for her). We will soon learn that Lewis is jailed for life for Nancy's murder. <br /> <br /> What exactly do we take for a movie like Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to feel sorry for the victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is this the main point in the film? Is sympathy with Nancy really justified? I do not think so. The film's book creates an ugly man on Albert's character, a person so isolated from his emotions that he is responsible for Nancy's retreat. But are people one-dimensional in real life? I do not think so. They have an obnoxious Lewis, a man who earns a living by appending pain, and comes and hits Albert for neglecting Nancy. Moreover, his expression of love towards Nancy (before he kills her) is supposed to show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter whether filmmakers have identified where their sympathies are with the various characters in the film. They are determined to incite their audience with scenes of unjustified violence, so that Downloading Nancy becomes more than just an exercise in bad taste and soft pornography.
