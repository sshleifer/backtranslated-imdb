Play scenes such as slow motion Jackie Chan and pathetic wit attempts (the worst game is quite puny: "guess what? This time I heard you were coming"). The stars are an unmatched couple: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he says, actually shows the effects of charisma and screen magic - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this film). Note to the director: In the future, please stay away from any scenes of love, especially when the main actress does not nudity and you have to rely heavily on double the body. (* 1/2)
