Silly, often ridiculously involving the landing of a spaceship and the resulting destruction, causing Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people in orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always amazed at Daniels. This depth and promise was demonstrated in the "conditions of grain" in 1983 such as Shirley McLean's smelting. Over the years, Daniels was unable to get a good and tasty role. Instead, he's in crazy comedies like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> As for this image, it fails because of the subject. At least, the latest television series a variety of positions. In the film, we have a constant flirting and people are turning into monsters where the government is thwarted to take over Mars Martin. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of a film's failure. On television, Pamela Breton filmed a small person stuck in positions while leaving Mars at a loss. In the film version, she tries a blond shell bearing the name Brown, a romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent, or is he really? <br /> <br /> Too much disappointment for those who enjoyed the TV show so much.
