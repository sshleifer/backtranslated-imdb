The fact that I did not like music is very personal, historical mistakes are not. I realize it's an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people are lying about it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the mastermind of the operation, which was organized and reorganized because of his discovery on board, in order to liberate 50 terrorists from Israeli jails, including Samir Kuntar, a heinous terrorist who can find his story through Search for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on Google. Abu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he did not set foot on Achilles' Achilles. Bin Laden did not put forward the planes that hit the World Trade Center, did he? <br /> <br /> *** Potential spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film virtually excludes terrorists' actions and reactions because of the horrors they may have experienced, highlighting and always exaggerating how much the Israelis have done to harm them. However, they never portray the harm Palestinians have inflicted on Israelis. The film (very terrible) uses pictures of the horror of Sabra and Shatila, and nothing is said, which reduces the belief that Israel is responsible, without ever mentioning that the Syrian Syrian army led the massacre. <br /> <br /> The acting was a very bad year, but I think that's what you expect from the opera singers? <br /> <br /> In another note, I was shocked by the way a person can excuse terrorists for killing one of the hostages because the hostage tried to provoke 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, adding that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how unhappy his wife was, spitting at the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope that no one in the world will be as cruel as they are (wink wink)
