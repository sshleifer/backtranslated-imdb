Although this film was produced before Dogme appeared as a mainstream in filmmaking, before digital victory overcame this goal. You get this point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly predicted these developments. Korin Nemec is just as wonderful as a well-known writer and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegantly, because the cinema is very beautiful. Register next time on T.V. , Because I guarantee you will never see a film better than nostalgia. Directly to the video did not feel good!
