Lorenzo Lamas is starring Jack `Solider Kelly, a former veterinarian in Vietnam and a dissident police officer on a search and rescue mission to rescue his retarded sister. The gruesome film is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo got the third bill, and he has 3 minutes of screen time, and even that is not good. Overall a terrible film, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree in bags and muzzled deserve some laugh (unintended). Followed by an improved sequel.
