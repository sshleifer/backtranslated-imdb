Let me start by saying that I will try not to put a lot of spoilers in this. I usually enjoy Robin Williams movies, but these were not one of them. Was described as an impressive film. The night listener was nothing but. To be frank there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 withdrew, for good reason. In my opinion the film was badly written and directed. The acting was fine but again there was nothing to work with. The film revolves around the storyteller who reads a good book by a dying child. However * Enter nervous here * No one can check the presence of children. Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is headaches and excuses from guardians. There is this. Wait for an hour and a half and the film ends. He had a lot of excitement and chills like visiting a dentist's office. Homosexuality, or ring tones have nothing to do with the story, and the film had few offensive words, but it seems to have been put there for no reason at all and made no sense. In conclusion, I can not really write a decent review on this film because there was nothing for it, it was as easy to see as dry paint. I gave him 2 because the representation of what he deserved was good and was not directed by Paul.
