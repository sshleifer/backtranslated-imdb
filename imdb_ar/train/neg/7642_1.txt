Everyone seems to care about the subject, and they do not really notice how the film was made. Deaf, silent man is fine, wins the underdog - this is good, cricket side is awesome, but the film is generally average. I think it can be made much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is highly predictable for a movie that does not depend on a real event. I'm sure the movie might be more interesting. The songs were stuffed there only and I had to redirect the viewer where the same thing would be displayed from different angles. <br /> <br /> Despite good behavior. Chubble.
