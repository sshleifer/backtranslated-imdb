To say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad film that is incredibly cheap. I can really get into a good home theater movie, even a surreal and twisted play like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, since those films already have something worth discussing when the credits expire. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries in every way to be deep and intellectual, and there is no content in this film. This film was poorly executed, the visual images in this film are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this film .. I laughed for their Guitars brothers, but it was immediately wiped out with something totally unnecessary and irrelevant. I have tried to be profound and meaningful to myself, but this is just a trifling nonsense. A student without a camera can formulate something more exciting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and stand-up standings get a point each, and everything else is going very badly, and deceptive attempts at being as good as the films of real directors such as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people who care about FFFC do so because they have no idea what they saw, because it was only moderate statements related here and there mixed with stupidity and even mixed up hanging around in your shoes. <br /> <br /> The film was extremely disappointing, achieving the highest level of Survive Style 5+, a film that has a real meaning, along with excellent use of the scene, cinematography, engaging dialogue, funny moments, good soundtrack and excellent performance, Great speed and flow. The FFFC is quite unlike anything else, a dull scene (20 minutes staring at a nice beach at night? A completely white stage? Foreign balls floating in a white space? An elegant school entrance and then ... a school entrance?) Cinematography, forgotten dialogue, no Something funny or humorous, except for the fact that you have wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack, or amateur shows, uneven, or offline, often going fast, never flowing at all. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that this is what FFFC makes a wonderful film, and it is uncommon every time that his genius is exclusive. It's simply a way to crush your ego, because "unpredictable" can be a good quality for a movie if it is not associated with "boring", "rude" and "awful". I personally spoke with two people who confessed to me that FFFC was awful when they left the theater, but the overwhelming delirium by the artistic elites made them watch the film again and then came back to me. "Oh, it was so good I loved it." <br /> <br /> I will put my foot, this film is still shaking, and I do not care if Roger Ebert said that this film is the best thing he has ever seen since he lost his virginity. "New Emperor's mantle" I say ... This film is by no means an indicator of the other trilogy / trilogy coming from Japan in the last ten years. Taste of Tea, Party 7, and Kamikaze Girls are much better (even with a low budget), and none of them can be honestly compared with Survive Style 5+. See FFFC only if you are interested in making a tonnage pile on a limited budget.
