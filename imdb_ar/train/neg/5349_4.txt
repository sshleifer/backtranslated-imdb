This direct line to video is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis' life. As Disney's tradition is, quality is sacrificed in the name of getting quick money; this is a lazy renovation with Moranis shrinking himself by mistake and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Immediately visualized the visual effects and vulgar dialogue in this cheesy lame, who did nothing but make me pine for "incredible shrinking man" days, when this kind of thing was done correctly. Tragically, this is directed by the top cinematographer Dean Cond√©, who either has to stick to the daily function or choose better material next time.
