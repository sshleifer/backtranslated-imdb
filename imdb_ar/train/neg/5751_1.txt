You have to shoot the movie in one day, there are scenes where you can see the camera's reflections and red indicator, even the green light of the scene that blends with the actors !!! The plot and the lines are really shocking without even the slightest inspiration (at least as a film of thriller). All about Poe in the film, has a shallow and childish approach. The film is full of excitement and excitement. If you want to watch a funny b movie a relaxing evening with friends then go so you will enjoy it (as I did) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
