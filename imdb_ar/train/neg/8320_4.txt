After watching Awake, I came to an end: The director and screenwriter Juppi Harold did an awake to laugh at the viewer, because the simple truth is that the film is full of ridiculous elements. Contains a lot of plot holes and is filled with ridiculous and ridiculous elements (eg, wearing the hospital's main personal spirit ... is it left by the doctor's ghost in the ground?). The concept behind this film is somewhat innovative but all the holes in the plot and the ridiculous things make this film stupid and insane. Except for Lina Olen the great, all the actors make bad performances. Hayden Christensen does not have zero expressions and the same applies to Jessica Alba. role.Awake makes laughter from onlooker. It's ridiculous and full of ridiculous things that are impossible to take seriously. My recommendation is: skip this crappy movie.
