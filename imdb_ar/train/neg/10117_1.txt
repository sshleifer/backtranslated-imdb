Wonderful. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a horror movie B I have found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought it was like a movie to my mood. I brought him home and put him on. <br /> <br /> This was not the B Horror movie that was in my mind. This was much worse. I wanted a bad film but what I got, I did not know that such nonsense existed between man. This film seemed to be 5 years old, written and directed, and this is wonderful about it. <br /> <br /> I am an ambitious director and this film has made me so crazy that someone is pushing this guy directly. He needs to work in a garbage dump in a place he belongs to. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting this or buying it. I will tell you the same thing that I will tell someone preparing to commit suicide. "Do not do it, it's not worth it!" I really do not have a nice thing to say about this film. Do not do it!
