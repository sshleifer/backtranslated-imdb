James Bishop (Matt Stacy) goes to the Mental Disability Facility for a medical residency with Dr. McCourt (Bruce Baines). There, he realizes that many trainees are being killed by the "Ripper", who takes their lives to Satan, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so silly and amazing that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are very silly, especially when the character of Helen, James Bishop Ashkar's fiance, is so unbelievable that a writer has the courage to be included in a scenario. What about James' return to the hospital to bring the files of the dead? Cast, consisting of representatives of pork and actresses? Frankly, I do not know what is or who is the worst in this film: film script, director or actors. The correct answer is certainly all of them. I saw this flick on TV, and I was amazed at how the product could spend money in such a garbage. The horror film becomes very funny given the absurdity of the plot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dem√¥nio" ("Devil")
