My mom used to work in a video store and got a preview of the movies before she left. So when she came home, The Convent, a horror film, I could not wait to see it. Given that it's supposed to be scary but it's really quite hilarious, I can say that in a strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting bad, yes, it is the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's very funny! "What, do you smoke CA-RACK ?!" I did not know that this movie has been released so far ... I thought it was so bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, ... Overall, the movie is very bad (you should admit it a lot at least ) But I promise you, you'll get a good laugh from him. <br /> <br /> * This movie is somewhat fun but good for laughs ... especially that guy who carries "Dagger of Despair" .. Dagger DESPAAAAAIR!
