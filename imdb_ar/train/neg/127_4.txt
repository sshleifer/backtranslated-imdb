I hired I CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was initially seized by US Customs if you tried to enter this country, and thus fans of movies that Considered "controversial" I had to really see it myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a young Swedish dramatist named Lina Tried to learn all she can about life. She particularly wants to focus her attention on producing a documentary about what the Swede has been thinking about some political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. Among politicians and ordinary residents in Stockholm asked about their views on politics, she had sex with a drama teacher, her classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me about "I'm angry" is that 40 years before, this was considered pornographic. In fact, sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even if they are not filmed as some cheap pornographic films. Although my compatriots look awful, sex and nudity are a key element of Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, whose answer to the good old boy John Ford, can be said, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I commend the directors because any sex shown in the film is presented for technical purposes instead. From just shocking people and earning money to be displayed in pornographic theaters in America. I CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (not pun intended) in Swedish cinema. In fact, this film does not contain much of the plot.
