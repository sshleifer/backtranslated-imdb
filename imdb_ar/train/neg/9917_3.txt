When the next Stanwyck husband is killed on the eve of their wedding, she retreats to a mountain lodge, slipping off the cliff and rescued by Morgan's rich lawyer. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to one-sided marriage certainly, spent on a huge property in Chicago (apparently surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez's frustration, but finally returns to Morgan, in a very weak and unconvincing story. <br /> <br /> This movie has great actors (especially Morgan is my favorite) and a great director, but the script is curvy and sometimes useless. I was quite prepared to enjoy this film, but I was disappointed in the end. Still worth watching for the actors, which is good for anyone who loves the 1930s movies.
