A strong blow when released from the Australian fans, may remain funny to this day, but their heavy political experts and humorous humor can make it even more strange. It takes a very long time; some of the <br /> <br /> content could be saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie holds his own, which was in dire need of some new things anyway. His funny Australian position is certainly funny, but it also becomes troublesome as the film continues. Some say Crocker's songs are the best, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will be a landmark in Australian cinema, but we must do everything in our power to make sure that the majority of Australians do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, therefore, Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
