Strange take on the tale of Cinderella. It's a terribly poor scenario, but Kathleen Turner is performing a wicked performance from a wicked mother. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. Fashion ranges from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Quickly advance to see something interesting and save yourself 90 minutes full of driving range. <br /> <br /> If you are really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest "Ever: Cinderella Story" or "Glass Slipper".
