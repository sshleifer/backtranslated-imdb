Do not drink first aid. <br /> <br /> This is a disguised essay in the form of a documentary film. Her title "really" is just ordinary nonsense. The debate on global warming is not over, and will only end when the ecological zombie begins to recognize the mountain of evidence that runs counter to its beloved theory. Only Google "Global Warming", "Hoax" or "Junk Science" will find a stream of information that refutes almost every link in the Gore sites logic chain. The reason for the importance of educating people for themselves is the catastrophic economic impact of global warming prevention measures. People woke up. Anyone with a computer, a little time, and some common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not close to credibility. Do not just read articles that support your current views, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis of the procedure, really. There are simply a lot of alternative possibilities and anti-theory evidence to have a basic level of scientific credibility. It is incredible, in fact, that it may be the greatest trick in the course of human existence. The time has come for people to start talking against this kind of propaganda. It is time for people to recognize for themselves and others that you can be environmentally friendly and recognize the obvious result that global warming hysteria is a big lie.
