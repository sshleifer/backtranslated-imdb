As others have said, "No, Luciano" is the title or response more appropriate to the title of the film. For entertainment, the great opera singer must commit to singing ... not that he is a terrible actor. This movie stinks completely. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a lovely family movie, as it was - but then it was only a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti, who plays the role of a "suitable singer" named "Giorgio Fini," plays his voice several times and the doctor "Pamela Taylor" (Katharine Harold) comes to rescue. Then the singer drops on the doctor, and the doctor drops slowly to the singer, they argue all the time and continue. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti enjoys a winning smile and is a lovable man. It's Harold who spoils things and after seeing them here, I'm not surprised she did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful scene in the movie to enjoy it, and great footage of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I felt bored and did not remember much about the second half of it.
