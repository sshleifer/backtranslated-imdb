There is no decent scenery one. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams made one of the worst performances ever. Proof that you can start anywhere. The man playing Sebastian sucks, too. So it is not much like Ryan Phillip. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are terrible. <br /> <br /> Then dialogue is also nonsense. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to get triple): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat this? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The end contrasts entirely with the original layout. In the first film, it was clearly stated that Catherine and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Catherine to be very bad, apart from the fact that she was played by Sarah Michelle Gillard, was that she was "the only girl who could not kill him." It was a tease that I love playing with. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his desire. Then in this letter, it means that she can have, along with a girl on the side. What? We do not see sex either. It is implicit, making him not only stupid, meaningless, contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> At first, Catherine refuses Sebastian because he fell in love and made him a loser. Despite winning the bet, his chances have collapsed. Then in this feces, loses and falls in love. So are not screw "losers", only the losers are full? Another thing: He said Sebastian was never in love, so what do you call the Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, the eldest girl was suddenly revealed to be the evil lesbian mistress of Catherine. (dun dun), and as I said, they go to the lame trio outside the screen. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are many other conspiracy contradictions. Did the writer witness even the first film? A 5-year-old can refer to his or her purposes. <br /> <br /> After the trio, Sebastian performs sex with the virgin maiden, spoiling her innocent mind in the back of the limo while Kathryn and Vergen Girle run a lesbian lesbian in a lame. Put a sudden twist sitting in the front, listening, and an evil smile in the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Sebastian's vision became the hole in the ass that was in the first film making an interesting film. I think all it takes is to make Sebastien a little bad is triple with two hot girls. interesting.
