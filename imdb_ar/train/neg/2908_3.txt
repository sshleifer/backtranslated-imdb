Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and might be great literature, this adapting to cinema really absorbs because it is more like fighting against sleep than enjoying some movie dishes. The story revolves around an old couple whose son died and lives a life dominated by poverty. The main character is the cock that we hope will someday bring some money for the next cuckoo fight. I'm not in the mood to throw more words on this useless buzzer. Maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sit for 90 minutes in front of your screen for that purpose only? No gracias .....
