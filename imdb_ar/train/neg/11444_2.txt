SNL is very funny but people who say this is like watching a short comic play on a little SNL think. Nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like John Hyder but he fails. Although John Hyder is very funny at Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries his best and people think he is funny. <br /> <br /> It was just ridiculous in the film Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was funny enough with Andy was the billiard part. <br /> <br /> They could have made the Quiet Place much better if they did not make the falling scene 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> The part in which H is pronounced more is the retarded. They are trying to go with her for a long time and half the time it seems that Andy is laughing as he acts ... He is a terrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and for the thoughtful people with 10 years of comedy. Which is nearly half of the United States.
