Okay. I know that the John Hughes movies you want to be in the eighties were all flat on one side, so the expectations for this film were very low. <br /> <br /> However, after sitting in these craps, there is one major thing I can do. "I seem to have stepped out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sat in Rob Lowe in the 1980s, It has no nudity and only sex glimpses in it. <br /> <br /> The acting is great and the characters are boring and flat, portraying Oxford as an absolute insult, and the paddling scenes are exciting, serene, and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless You've got something weird ally or Amanda Shandy (or I think, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this.
