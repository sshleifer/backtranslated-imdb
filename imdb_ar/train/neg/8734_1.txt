I may have seen one too many fits of crime, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most incarnate film, the lack of conspiracy, the absurd conspiracy, and just a plain stupid film I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems to take less time to show it than it did to put it together. <br /> <br /> Actually to make it straight to the video before it is complete. <br /> <br /> It's a nasty inconvenience to the classic movie "M" by Fritz Lang starring Peter Laurie. You're much better off renting it instead.
