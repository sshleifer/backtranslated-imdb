Last night, I decided to watch the bricol or I'll tell the so-called Breckwell for the way Carlito - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" that went directly to the DVD ... no wonder ..... quite .. I fully mean S% and KS! I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this festival from the film .... except for one fact that I hang my hat on ... Jay Hernandez who plays the role of young Brigante. ... Reminded me how De Niro entered in Brando's shoes to portray young Don Corleone in the second godfather ... but the difference De Niro was amazing and even won the Academy Award !!! Jay Hernandez well has the courage to try to be a young Pacino .... very bad for him, I do not think he will play in the film anymore, by the way after I watched this movie #% ty, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get a taste Bad from my mouth.
