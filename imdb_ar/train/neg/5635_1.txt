I also love Dafoe as an actor but I wasted a few hours of my life watching this movie actually, I still can not believe I was able to see it completely. Was there actually a point in the film ?, and the result, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this horrible excuse from a pathetic movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without looking for the facts, but have you married Davo or seen the awful actress in this real-life movie, if so it was an attempt to start her career ?, if I was afraid it had failed. . <br /> <br /> I posted this in the hope that I could postpone someone watching this movie, even if there was one person taking his comments and deciding that he would rather watch drying paint, I would feel that I had achieved some good in the world, if you I've spent the same advice ...
