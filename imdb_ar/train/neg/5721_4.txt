I was not at all impressed with the 2005 Gore Festival, which was a great success at Hostel, and most of the heavy blows to the lame meat were the same or worse - but Live Feed managed to keep me enjoying about 30 minutes. I started with a lot of sex and shaky settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese organized crime squad and a 7-foot-long butcher's hutch ... What brought me out of the film was the tough "hero" with guns and grudge today ... I would like to call This film is mediocre, at best, because the premise that mainly includes the hateful young people who are slaughtered in an abnormal porn theater, and multiplies into a mafia hideout, attracts me. If torture is long enough to be fully effective, my assessment will be very different. Unfortunately, most atrocities are grouped together in one scene, making the rest of the film conclude as a scenario of revenge type. So, basically, it is just a low budget "hostel" taking advantage of the use of unwarranted sex, which is almost constant during the first half of the film ... Overall, I would say do not care about this.
