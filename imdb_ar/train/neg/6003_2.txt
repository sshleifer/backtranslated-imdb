Sundown - featuring the weakest dorkiest vampires ever, accompanied by one of the most blurred and fatuous results ever written - and with Vampire Shin, who had every step and word spoken so silly that I burst out laughing half the time and drew me the eyes of the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have any special powers at all - except for the power (sometimes), the ability to turn off the lamp with their mind (once) and ... that's all really. Did you ever imagine that Dracula was falling from the anxiety of fighting, because he ran out of bullets? No one in practice has done anything else - Dracula - will eat this breakfast, litter his skin and use their bones as a tooth stick. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film is that a human family of four people are caught up in the battle of the vampire gang - Dracula vs. some old weird man. It could have been the good old B-flick fun, but the hyper-dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this film seriously, and ended up destroying the rest of the film that was not destroyed by the clay bats already, acting modestly and the funny scenario . <br /> <br /> In the end, it's ridiculous to be funny. It certainly has some fun moments, but it is few and far between.
