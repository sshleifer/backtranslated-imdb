While I watched this movie, I tried to find out why they were upsetting to do it. Although the main plot of the film is probably good, there are all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. Hollywood marketing people must dictate the multiple bad guys, the permanent double crosses, men and women who come together and have sex. It is strange to see more of them having sex than we did with the president and his mistress. The many plots and sub-plots make the film too much and none of the characters are properly developed - I did not really feel that I knew any character except that everyone was corrupt and evil. The ending is completely incomplete - you've left me more than just wanting to get what it might be, but what it was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation for why anyone does what he does, except that additional corrupt personalities commit the double intersection. I am surprised that many well-established actors (and good guys) have agreed to produce a hollow film. This seemed like a film produced by college students working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you are in a movie chapter and want an example of what you do not do when making a movie.
