In the story of "Romulus, My Father" by Eric Pana, of the fame of "Munich," the poor German immigrant struggling to raise his son Raymond (Cody Smeat McVeigh) plays in rural Australia in 1960. The main obstacle to family stability and happiness is his wife Christina (Franca Bottnet), who blatantly violates her wedding covenants by unknowingly removing men. Despite her very unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give her a divorce, torturing himself in the hope of one day. Unfortunately, Raymond has good faith and must testify to all these marital disorders - and his memoirs are the basis for the film (Cinmo Raymond Gita later to be an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, Daddy" for what you are trying to do, I can not honestly say that I enjoyed it, because while the film contains some good performances and serious intentions that are waiting for it simply is not enough to address The story of the story and the speed of the funeral, which makes the audience desperate and depressed like people on the screen. The dangerous drama that surrounds a slice of life is one thing, but this relentless and reckless optimism of adultery, insanity and multiple suicide (not to mention attempted suicide) is another thing.
