** Potential spoilers forward ** <br /> <br /> Jason (also known as Herb) Evers is a wonderful brain surgeon who, along with wife Virginia Laith, participates in the most car crashes on the screen at all. Laith is beheaded and brought back to his head by the doctor and his head is activated in his laboratory. The exterior of the palace was allegedly filmed at the Lindhurst building in Tarrytown. The factory scenes seem to have been hit in someone's cellar. Survival head is kept on "laboratory equipment" that looks cheap enough to Ed Wood. Some of the library music appeared at the top of the film later in The Body BENEAT. Laith's head possesses some heavy metaphysical rhetoric with someone else who has ever sinned and is chained in the closet. In the meantime, the good document rides the bar joints in search of a corpse worthy of his wife's macaroni. The finish, with its uncoated version, features some splashing and cutting early when the zucchini-headed monster comes out of the cupboard to put the film in welcome. It took three years to be released, and then the audience gave him the bad reception he deserved. Among these, plan 9 was to be announced from outer space and a few others, in 1959 in Turkey.
