A fan of TLK films, where the first is a milestone and the second is probably the best Disney supplemental film, this movie comes together ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice work and music, but nothing more than Timon / Bomba screw in the TLK atmosphere . Although it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is one big joke ... and that's about all it saves. Make True TLK3, Disney! Possibilities exist. <br /> <br /> 4/10
