On the roof, "Show Me The Money" must have ended at least a full season. You always have William Shatner as your host, surrounded by dozens of bakers of beautiful long models collectively called "Million Dollar Dancers". You have knowledgeable contestants who have interesting stories about their lives and who are supposed to know a lot about pop culture. And you have big money! So what's the mistake? <br /> <br /> The shape of this game was a failure. A good presentation of the game needs at least two things from three things: very simple rules, exciting speed and the ability to play at home. The best, the most durable they have three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM did not have anything. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were among the most complex rules in any game introduced for the first time in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> The contestant started with a single word or short phrase followed by the letters A, B, C (a network pin?). Each letter is connected to a separate question, all this starts with that word or phrase. Once the contestant chooses a character, he or she can either answer or pass this question and choose a second character. If they pass, they should see the following question and have the same option. However, if they went through the second question, they were required to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answered and before they found out whether their answer was correct, they had to choose one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money passing by them. They have disclosed the amount of the dollar (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the rider has answered correctly ... or replied an error ... this amount will be added or subtracted from the pot. <br /> <br /> Still with me In addition, there was one dancer carrying something known as the "killer card". If you choose a dancer that carries a Killer card and you have got your question correctly, you are safe and the game continues. However, if you are not correct, you have one final question to answer. If you make a mistake in the last question, you are out of the game. If you realize it well, the game will continue. <br /> <br /> There was no resignation, or get away from the money earned until you answered six questions correctly or made a mistake in six questions or you are up to now in the hole that you can not earn enough money to return. I got you? Okay! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was the total lack of tension, because of the design of the game. The contestant can answer the questions he knows he does not know, and answer many of the questions he knows, which makes the pressure less. After that, they can still find a low dollar amount, even after they have deliberately lost the question, which means there was no "drama". The fact that they can answer five wrong questions and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. The speed of asking questions was deadly slow: the questions were often very clear, it was absurd to try to provoke tension, as if there were any doubts about some of the more common answers. <br /> <br /> There is no real tension at any time during the show and those very complex rules prevented this program from working, despite the talents of Schappner terpsichorean.
