Being a great fan of PLANET OF THE APES "other" movies, I rented this DVD despite the curry for all things Tim Burton. Again, do not disappoint in his uninspiring direction. Even the makeup of the monkey seems to be second, which is unforgivable given the horrendous budget of this brutality. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not represented (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough evidence). I was embarrassed by real talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their salaries were motivated because it could not have been a stereotypical scenario. I rented this DVD at a special $ 1 night and I still feel annoyed.
