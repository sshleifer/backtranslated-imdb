<br /> <br /> As with other episodes in this series specifically designed for television that expand on many of the adventures of the sea legend, Horatio Horn Blaur's superhuman crush destroys every opportunity to thrill. <br /> <br /> When Wesley Kracher destroys a few seasons of the next generation, Horatio Horn Blaur saves every position invincibly. Every intelligent solution comes inevitably from the lips of Horatio Horn Blaur. Hornblower's main problem in this film series seems to be incomparably superior to overcoming many of the wrong characters above and below the chain of command. A perfect object makes for a boring story. Our hero is the best, so those who try to help him are powerless to do something properly unless the Hornblower exists to guide each step and control it. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning in telling a story about any person who can not do the wrong and will win over and over again every time? What is the point of watching this story?
