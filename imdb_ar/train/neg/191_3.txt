... for not living in Montana and especially not living there at the end of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> "River passes through" is definitely a good film from a cinematic point of view. Wonderful scenery, well done by Redford. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is a dry, narrow-minded figure like his father, a preacher. Being driven and not driving his life, he has left to watch his brother, who is also imprisoned in a small town environment, losing his life. The author never gets close to getting rid of his brother's motives, but at least realizes that he lacks the least fun / fun. All it takes is fly fishing, where the style of his father's man is like an old man. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, but predictable from the start. <br /> <br /> Definitely should not be seen (3/10) <br /> <br />
