This movie was worth five punches on my "harter card". I saw this while I was based in Virginia in the mid-1970s. I saw it on his own so I was not distracted while watching it. Absorb. It was the most common and most common celluloid impotence I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who reviewed this movie thought it was awesome. I tell you this: If it's great, what was the box office? End of discussion.
