I wished I had registered the men in white so I could see it again <br /> <br /> "What, do you mean that you really enjoyed theo?" <br /> <br /> I do not mean that I can see it again to see if it is backward, stupid, or as embarrassing as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Many people have claimed it is made for children. May I suggest that it is made by children? Because the entire structure of the script lacks any kind of discipline by the authors and producers and it seems that many of the specific pieces were included because they seemed a good idea at the time <br /> <br /> The cast does not help, but I am already feeling sorry for them . Honestly, you can believe that during the filming, their family members had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard pornographic film, that was the embarrassment they felt about having to appear in something so dismal. To give you an idea of ​​how misrepresented each time the babe Donna Derricko of BAYWATCH disappeared from the narrative that I patiently waited for it to reappear, then seconds later I forgot it was in the film. Received it? A star appears from BAYWATCH and seconds later you forget that you are in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the level of men in the United States <br /> <br /> Enough, trying to be a live animation like GOODIES (although DISMALS will be a better character for this movie), although the movie It may be worth the credit not to go down to the bathroom toilet, but since it is a children's movie (this did not stop on ITV at 11pm) there should be no spirit near the humor of the joint in any case
