Personally I think this offer seems very expensive. Some actors are awesome. They do more and look fake. I can always figure out how it will end within the first 10 minutes or less as it makes it perfectly clear. It's not very well written either. I love watching him laugh at him. You know, "It's so bad that it's good?" Well, that saying applies to this show. I would also like to watch only to see if I am right when I guess how everything will end. So now I've been right every time. It's like a small game I play. It's nice when you're bored and feel a bit of a laugh.
