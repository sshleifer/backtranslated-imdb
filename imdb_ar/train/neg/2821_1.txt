I only watched this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has little plot, and it seems to be nothing but a continuous scene of sadistic psychological violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this film because he starred in the second film "The Night of the Devils"; I wanted to see her play as a natural person. Unfortunately, the text of Tobe Hooper hardly begins and does not go anywhere where Robert Englund controls the film and chews the scene and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
