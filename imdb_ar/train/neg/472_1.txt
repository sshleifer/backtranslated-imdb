The only thing I remember about this film are two things: first, when I was 12 years old, so I thought it was difficult. Second, it was so bad when Mad magazine did a parody of her, resigned after the front page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying they had completely ignored it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great Sufumurian comedy in this period, try Animal House. It is stupid and stingy, it leads to fine art. Another good choice is Caddyshack, the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he gets so annoying, with big lines like Sparkler Carl Spackler. "Correct me if I'm wrong on Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers I'll close and throw the key."
