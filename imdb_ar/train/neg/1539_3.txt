I'm a big fan of Westerners but this one .... Woe, what a stink! I guess what shut me off almost correctly away from the bat was the indirect dialog box. I think I wrote a better dialogue than that when I was in eighth grade. And poor actors! In view of this terrible dialogue, none of them encountered an ironic appearance. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of this is a bit better than what you'll get in Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. It is possible that he was the "big" star in this film, and if you have called him B-Western, you will be praised. This is what should be called B-minus the western perhaps. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, House Davis, Frank Sinatra, and other major talents. For him to appear in a vehicle, this poor person must have tried to minimize his importance for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> There is something annoying about this film that all the men seem to have never had a week and their faces are all greasy. I know that in the old West men were not always well prepared but for men, this is a film that makes you want to go to "EWWWW"! Really, this is a trivial West. Denver Bale also had to live this one, especially after its appearance in many Westerners. Bad movie, bad.
