As usual, I went to watch this film for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not good. Rajni wanted to finish his film career with this film would be successful. Fortunately, unfortunately, the film was a failure. After this he made a successful blow with Chandramuki. I'm anxiously waiting for Shivaji to come. <br /> <br /> I have read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting because the user of TN also. Rajni is one actor who works, I think, from his heart and not from his mind. He is not a representative like Kamal Hassan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong strength in his age. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I need to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so wish you good luck Rajni ...... .....
