A woman (Sylvia Kristel) drowns a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all related to some stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> Easy one of the most sexual comedy to worry about at all. Does anyone realize that this film highlights the harassment of children? I think it's fine because it's a teenage boy - if we have someone with a man who seduces a teenage girl he would be (really) angry. Sorry, but doing for a boy does not relieve him. Still sick. I realized that Brown was at 18 (he was 18 years old when he was made), but he looked 15 years old. I find it disturbing that some people find this good. <br /> <br /> Draw aside the acting suckers (Kristel is beautiful - but can not act; Brown easily is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen), and Nudity becomes hard-nosed and not so exciting remotely. <br /> <br /> I saw this impulse in a theater back in 1981. I was 19 years old with his 14-year-old cousin (who could pass easily for 18 years). I wanted to see it - I did not but I decided what the heck? We have already entered and bought tickets for three underage boys. My cousin thought it was boring and left the other three children in the middle of the road! Let me make this clear - three TEENAGE boys have left a film with lots of female nudity! It should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I'm surprised that this was ever released. 1 along the way.
