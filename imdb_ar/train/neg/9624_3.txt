Given the potential of this step, the reality was disappointing. Although it's always good to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, that could not change that. Most of the work was expected. The jokes were flat to amusingly mild. The characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this film, but it never happened. Ben Stiller Farhana was in the film "There's Something About Mary". Here it sounds like just going through suggestions. If they have to raise the plot points from "friends", they should know that there is something wrong. Humor should be kept in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See "50 First Dates" instead.
