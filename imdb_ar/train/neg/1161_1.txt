As a member of the team, I was a member of the band in all basketball games, and I would like to tell the world after the film came in that we have not been allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was because producers and the director broke the contract with the University of Oregon where he was shot. It seems that the U of O was shown. While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production crew. Mr. Nicholson was not forgotten because he was one of the most ill-behaved guys I've ever met. A good time for a 20-year-old. Certainly not the way campus life was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, despite what Hollywood might think. Trombone player from Oregon
