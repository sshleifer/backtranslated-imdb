This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen! This silly plot and all the "little man" crap is just stupid. The entire film is unrealistic and dumb. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy." This is just an awful piece of useless stuff that should not go to the theaters. Jokes are not funny and the representation is appalling. Please, I beg you to save your money from seeing this worthless piece. I had to sit down through the little man for an hour and a half, hoping I would bleed. I'm disgusted that something like that can even be thought of! Who writes this nonsense? The actors have no talent at all, how do they get into Hollywood? They earn money from this junk!
