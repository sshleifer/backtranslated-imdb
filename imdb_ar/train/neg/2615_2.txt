I do not know why, but for a sick reason, I think since I was in the Disney race, I decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first film, which was a new version of the classic Disney cartoon film starring Glen Claus like Carrolla de Ville, looked like a certain success, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these films did not work is that 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, and it worked better and was more attractive to children as well as adults. This is not really fun because adults are running around trying to act as caricatures instead of just real people. I understand they are trying to make sure they are attractive to children, but it's ironic to see how these actors behave in the film. The story of 102 Dalmations is not really good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in jail for a while, but things change when she proves she loves animals and is a nice person. But her reputation is now damaged as an active puppy, but she buys a dog shelter for a man, and all of a sudden everybody is loved and seems to have changed. But when the Dalmans see the surveillance officer, she feels crazy and begins to see and lose her positions. She has returned to avenge the puppies and is still determined to get a Dalmation coat that she has long wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is a very amazing actress, very low rated, but her experience with Cruella De Vil is good, but let's face it, making this fun little movie more than just a silly situation. Also, as with puppies, they work more for animation, they look stupid, but they are not only believable without the presence of cartoons and their personalities in the mix. I do not really recommend the 102 Dalmations, that's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, that's the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
