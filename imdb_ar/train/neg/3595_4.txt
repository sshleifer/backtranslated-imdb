I was not as lucky as others commented on this film: I have never seen anything else ... we have to say ... "sassy" mind. I agree with many: some actresses who spend a lot of time nude and dancing (departure go) are not really attractive. I loved Kinda Fraulein Crank (?) ... it was so beautiful, it was nice! The representation was also old, although connecting fonts in a second language may have caused much of this problem. Trying to follow the plot was a big routine task: was there one already? I honestly agree with one other comment: for the vampire film, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want to get good blood pressure, check out hammer classics such as Dracula Horror and Favorite Personal Brides Dracula Brides. <br /> <br /> The most spiritual (unintentionally) part is the place a lady doctor tears her clothes with a cloud of bat ... that you have never seen! ... bat, I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, as time for time if you encounter a cable here at Great White North but, for heaven's sake, do not hire it!
