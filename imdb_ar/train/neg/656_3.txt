Note: I could not force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. It can not be done only. Instead, I passed what I thought of while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things you thought of watching a concert tonight: <br /> <br /> - You're fed up with those dreams where these detailed deaths will happen, just to wake up the main character before you bite. Of course, when I say "perfect mortality", I mean to stop shaving the screen or stabs in the stomach. Did not Dallas ruin everything "It's just a dream"? When I talk about it, I wonder if bowel implants will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> - The movie is only ten minutes long and I can actually calculate horror clich√©s on my hand. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Even after interviewing a hero's friend, I am convinced that he will die. Anyone want to put bets? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a master-obsessed character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that "Donna" is a terrible name for a key character in a horror film?) He spends three years in a high-security prison before exploding and finds Donna celebrating her high school graduation. While there is no account of taste, I seriously wonder about who will take all this time to chase someone as dull as Donna. <br /> <br /> Higher schools allow parties to be held at hotels and not followed by students. Students seem to be quite able to buy a room in a hotel and go out and go as they please. I assume that if this plot point is not in place, the film will take 90 minutes of people getting bored of their minds and dusting randomly whenever they go to the bathroom. I suppose that the trade-off about excitement is absolute perfection with everything. I have already played "Count bubble gum chewed under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only in the 20 minute mark. How will I enjoy myself? Self-observation: Do not forget milk and bread on their way home. <br /> <br /> Dear scriptwriter: You have consumed enough false accounts to overtake this movie and every new edition of horror this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of this film was not good, but compared to this new release, it was like Citizen Kane, or at least the Godfather. She had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of the many post-Halloween horrors and had a little "twist" in the end. I miss Jimmy Lee. I hope you act more. <br /> <br /> - In the prom there is not much dancing going on. Instead, girls get into fights with their friends about where they plan to go to college. I hear that all these colleges are being raised by name, and I can only wonder who these girls should fool into the entrance exam. <br /> <br /> The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and erase his clutter between the scenes. This is the only logical explanation that makes him stab a person to death on the carpet or in the bathroom, and when someone climbs into the hotel room, there is no trace of the struggle. (On another side: This is a very lazy murderer, Michael Myers went to look for his victims, he just said.) <br /> <br /> - It's official: the whole audience in the theater is rooted in the killer. What sparked it? Was Dona coming back to her hotel room while the sirens were coming out and asking everyone to get out of the building? It was her constant dreams, and how she insisted on re-energizing her steps towards the starting point, even after having experienced something exciting in that dream. Or was Brittany Snow's performance unconvincing? I must say it was all the above. <br /> <br /> - Well, who has "died of screen in chapter three"? I won the bet. <br /> <br /> - Finally, the film is over. My friend turns to me and says "Donna was not very smart." This is an understatement of the week. It is a bit of a wonder that the hurricane is a small storm of wind, or that a week's power cut is a minor inconvenience. <br /> <br /> Move a favorable review. <br /> <br /> - I can not recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This lazy movie is as terrifying as any other way, and the only way to enjoy the cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten kinds of beer. Unfortunately for theater patrons, alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Out ****
