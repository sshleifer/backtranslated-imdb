My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of Modesty Blaise's origins. It's not that the film is terrible, it's not what I expected or hoped for. Although I've been familiar with Modesty Blaise for years, I'm not very familiar with comic strips or picture novels, so I come to this movie as something strange. This may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more work and more comedy. The film is driven by dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something that had a little more camp value. As it is, my name is humility is a dangerous film killer. There are very few "light" moments, if any. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing wonderful. As others have commented, they seem a little weak so that it is completely believable in the title role. What motion scenes in My Name is Modesty is one of the weakest movie spots. I never understood the idea that this woman could deal with a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes forward and makes the rumors a huge budget film based on Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I will look forward to it a lot.
