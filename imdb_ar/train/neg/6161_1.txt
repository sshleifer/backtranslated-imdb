Maybe this is the worst fencing, sword fighting, movie ever. This is not only because the fencing sport bad fencing, but because the plot and characters are so weak that they have to throw it into a semi-naked sexual scene, and later, the group is supposed to dance around the fencing scene at the fencing club, I suppose to keep the public attention. What a waste of the talents of Abraham Murray. It is best to serve you with very delightful movies such as Zorro and Scaramouche, anything that may be Basil Rathbone is the villain. As a duel myself, I realized that it was impossible to approach fencing as a sport in movies, but if it did, it had to have more intelligent characters and a better drawing and plot in more depth.
