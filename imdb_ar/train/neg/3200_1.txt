Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a swamp, a sweaty killer in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers was laughing at. Somehow, he still has a badge, probably because he lives in Texas and will allow anything to law enforcement there. <br /> <br /> This fat loser is a deputy dean of police near the Texas border. Not surprisingly, he was previously a guard for the Texas Rangers, but was kicked because he seemed to believe the law was his personal liar to play with him at his discretion. Including shooting at suspects crossing the international border into Mexico, beating suspects, cheating on gun battles, threatening women, starting firefighters who could have been avoided and managed to have the life of a threatened child in the process, and allowing women to visit him. He promised that he would help and protect, kill just so he could get out of jail, and so on. This man makes the Los Angeles police resemble the saints in comparison. <br /> <br /> When his partner is killed by a pair of Italian murderers, they are chased by the character of Joe Don and kill one of them. The other is then transferred to Italy at the request of Mr. Wilson, who rightly believes that Joe Don will be in a long time. In record time, the Italian loses and gets a Maltese taxi blown up in the process. This is just the first number of deaths and devastation that Joe Dun has left in his path as he travels around Malta in search of Palermo (the Italian killer). <br /> <br /> This is how the part of Mobius tape from the film, in which our hero is arrested, and his lecture by the Maltese Chief of Police begins, comes out and causes more trouble, is captured, is lectured by the Chief of Police ... and so on embolden. Until you want to blow your brains with the john's Joe Do's gun, which is treated with terror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves to be useless not only the first time Palermo runs away, but in chasing the next boat in which he drops in just one punch. He then takes Palermo after he threatens a woman with hugs. I hoped that Palermo would be punished in the cell of his basement, but no stripper threatened him and took him out, because he promised to protect her. Her throat is cut off immediately (a big surprise) and Joe escapes without to night. <br /> <br /> Here you hope he may have sunk in the chase of the boat. But even the ocean does not want him, and hangs him on a beach where the poor Maltese family sponsored him (what did they ever do to deserve it?) He returns to the city, where he was arrested by the police, and present by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The police officer who was accompanying him was released so they could go to Palermo. The reason for doing anything dead in the brain to destroy the career of this Great Cycle is something outside of me. It's just a very puzzling head. <br /> <br /> They go to the villa where Palermo is hiding and start shooting. Joe Don cheats eloquently, and kills Palermo. Then the last big and amazing line of the film says: "The big logo carries my shirt, can you get it for me?" Thank you for this immortal line, Mr. Baker. This will appear in the film's history records as the last-most-known, amazing and wondrous line spoken by a character in a movie. It certainly goes along with everything else about this character. Bravo.
