The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have an appealing charm: it starts with a scripture from the Bible (the part Samuel Jackson reads to his victims who will soon become Pulp Fiction) and continues with two schools of karate teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of humanity (Better? Sony Chiba or Bruce Lee?), Then Shiba appears playing himself; immediately stops hijacking an airplane and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any value for entertainment is quickly crushed, either deliberately or unintentionally, by the disjointed story, the lack of movement for long periods of time, and the quality of any current procedure. To simplify, here's the "The Bodyguard" reason for an unlikely movie: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any battles. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles are short and terribly pictured. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is awesome. Judy Lee is wonderful, her face glorious. For them only "The Bodyguard" was given the second star out of 10. This film makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.
