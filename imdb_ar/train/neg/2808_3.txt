A series of television films and television series attended by the star in 1980 (Mesti Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Cliffon Little, Seymour Cassell and others) in a story of a photographer who has a dream of killing his opponents. Of course, models and other people start to appear, causing all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> Good excitement has not ended very well enough of nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to generate anything real benefit. The best description for this is the film type which gave the cable channel Cinemax the name Skinamax alternative. I can not really see the point of view of this unless you need to see every sexy movie. (I must also comment that this film is full of smoking, so much so that it becomes laughable when anyone shines)
