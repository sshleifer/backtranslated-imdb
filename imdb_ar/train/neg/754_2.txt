I must admit I exploded in laughter when I saw one of the reviewers compare this to a LOTR. Well, if the dwarfs are excluded, the crew of thousands, great special effects, big battles, strong characterization, decent plot, good representation, elegant trend, and everything else. Leaving you with a walk. And boy, is this movie going! If Mr. Piano is making his way, it is likely to be three hours of fast walking in rural Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes or so these annoying marshes float for a few seconds to interrupt before going a little. I did not see much walking in a movie. If this budget is already $ 20 million, most of them must have gone to Mr. Piano's shoes, because he had to get through many couples with everything he did. This explains why there are no residual funds for decent effects, decent video cameras or suitable representatives. Frankly, it's like watching some exotic pagan videos for people who have something about hiking in the fashion period. Even if you move forward, this is a distorted walk. <br /> <br /> As for the elements of science fiction, I think it was wrong to put Martians in the film: they only object to walking. , Which is obviously more interesting to the director of the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano gets from walking dogs?
