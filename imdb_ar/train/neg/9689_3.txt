On one side, he resembles the "Wizard of Oz", with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. But it is supposed to be about love, possession, destruction and moral decay, while it is actually about designed gowns, shots of Riveria, lots of expensive cars, and music and dance performances that suggest to Vincente Minnelli on one of his holidays. Great view, but it is a wonderful example of desperate dark plot material and attractive style that goes in opposite directions. (Was this the model "The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone feel close to Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
