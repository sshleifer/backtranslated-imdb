Simana santa bad jaw. It's a big mistake in many ways and I do not start where I start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorfino, whose husband killed the judge during her protection, goes from Madrid to Seville to do a policing job. During the Holy Week (Semana santa, see? ... everyone starts to sleep .. it was bad at many points, even from the beginning), a murderer performs his victims like bulls in the bullfighting arena. She as a team with a male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and a nice Athene vodor. She will soon discover that she will be the next target of the killer (wearing a red robe). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why? .. This is the question that was in my mind the entire film. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did you go to see it A: because I love Mira Sorvino (so I excuse her for that in the first look crap) <br /> <br /> Q: Why were we only 8 people in the theater this Saturday The first weekend of the release? A: Ah ah ah. I got Spider-Man the same day. But also the fact that the film has been shown with exciting comments. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did you make this movie? A: Money I think. But the boy did not need Mira money. <br /> <br /> Then ... why ????????????? First of all, there is always a mistake in European common production. Here I got French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then you want to play on the same playgroung as the excitement / swordsman / whodunit / secrets / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although it was unnecessary and with a very bad scenario, it was much better in thrill and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to give some credit to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add a political scene to the story. . ERROR: This is done in flash reflections in a traffic-like photograph, which is certainly the most interesting thing in the movie. Can stick to it, you will not have to sit in the entire film. It is better to go directly to the backbone of Guillermo del Tros (El Espinazo del diablo) to get some smart fun. <br /> <br /> Then the fear of homosexuals. Paul! The first victims are homosexuality drug addicts from S & M who were stabbed to death. The annoying Oliver Martinez goes to a dating agency held by overweight transgender shaved with platinum blonde wig. Personality calls Mira Sorfino to a big dam all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Nah. Just offensive statements are unnecessary, just like colleagues. <br /> <br /> Then thrill. Yipee. There is no clear motive. The first murders are a clear illusion because they represent a famous painting. but not. It was possible that the murderer (the terrible fascist, of course) would be revealed from the beginning as it appears at the end of the film, I think, it's time for the director to say "weel, it's time to end that curse of the film. <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks it's a way out. Error: no sense of suspense, no sense to guide the actors, no knowledge of speed change. Giant, bear huge. The scenes of the Holy Week are unnecessary (perhaps a common production base says: Well, they shot in Seville but showed some credits for this beautiful and historic city with the Easter celebrations.) We: a mysterious film for tourists! <br /> <br /> Then the actors Actors. All errors. Mira Sorvino bears herself to death: she does almost nothing but stab her in the right hand. Everything I did was better (alternative murderers, Aphrodite the Great ...) as if they were not there. Olivier Martinez ... Hello, Is anyone here? When will the producers learn that he is not a representative but a fashion designer with no ability to speak or feelings? Feodor Atkine, cute and transparent. We just pay great respect to Adela Vale, one of the greatest actress of the last century (and I hope there are more roles at this stage). It is the main attraction here because it is the only one that blows the life of its lousy lines. I will not mention other actors because they are just one-sided, uninteresting and shallow characters. <br /> <br /> The inconsistent trend, inconsistent actors, unacceptable plot. Crap incarnate. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
