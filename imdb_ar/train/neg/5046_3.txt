The caricature destroys the story of a convincing period of time around the brilliant star Zhang Ziyi, who plays a remarkable role as a woman joining an extremist group in China in 1928, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and uniting with a former lover who now works for Japan. Each part of the drama and the front movement of the story is dried up by the method of the grammar director of the director Yi Lu. The characters still stare at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, hand-held cameras are forever stuck on faces that show endless reflexes longer than they need, and repeated adjustments the same reflex is triple repetition. We do not know anything about the characters when the story begins and new information is not mentioned as the story progresses, only the silence and steady shots of lovers who do not speak, who interact through silent dances but do not share any obvious emotional relationship. Very sleepy sleep movie.
