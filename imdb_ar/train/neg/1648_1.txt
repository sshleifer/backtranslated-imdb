Personally, while I am able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy some of the most stupid games. As you know, those are the times when you just want to sit down and watch some terrifying action movies to cut time. This is the only film I can remember actually closing in the middle, and I have no intention of coming back to the end. The plot was very fabricated and predictable, and I was talking about what the next scene would be easily (and I usually do not be good at this). The actors were awful, I've seen the best acting in middle school plays. Even the scene cutting operations were bad, the flow was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a funny parody forgotten.
