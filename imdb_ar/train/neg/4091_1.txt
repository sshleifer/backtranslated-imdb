Ah, Lucio Fulci, I'm lying in peace. This famous Italian notorious <br /> <br /> is famous for "Zombie", "The <br /> <br /> Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add this to the <br /> <br /> list that is not accessible. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, was about a woman wearing a gold mask and a G-string. She wanted a young lover called <br /> <br /> with a set of arrows Magical and Arch. It's magic! <br /> <br /> They glow. Arrow collaborates with a man in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> They spend most of the movie saving each other from the sequence of flat events. In the end, a nekkid chick is defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before taking off the mask and reminding us of why you separated from my high school friend <br /> <br /> Fulci bathe every shot in an orange glow The screen fills with smoke. The smoky orange sequence does not look like you would crave rocky sunshine and a cigarette. The special effects are <br /> <br /> funny. In one of the series, the mysterious duo of our homosexuals <br /> <br /> is attacked by dozens of arrows that are clearly scratches on the film <br /> <br />. Most of the effects must have been spent on the <br /> <br /> budget of the Fulci-licious Guru, which is made up entirely of pop-up wounds <br /> <br />. Hi, we can all use a good stimulated wound once in <br /> <br /> while, but when you get pushed the excess wound, it becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I still had to play with the brightness setting on my TV anyway <br /> <br /> Just to see what was going on before. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about prophecies and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> take a quick look at the future ... If you find this movie and see it, <br /> < > You will regret it. The scene in the video (by media) box does not appear <br /> <br /> in the movie in any context. "Conquest" is a tricked action. What could MST3K do with this! <br /> <br /> This is rated R for strong physical violence, strong heirs, female custom <br /> <br />, short nudity, and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
