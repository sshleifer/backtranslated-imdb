Although, or perhaps in part, because of the intelligent musical use to emphasize the motives and ideologies of each of the main characters, there are stereotypes, and the ideas and descriptions have been found in this very inaccurate film field. <br /> <br /> One feels that John Singleton was clinging to post-structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day, and "higher education" was the biased outcome. The low point in the film is the "Peace" rally, where the "Free Love" movement symbols are reused in the 1960s, much like the "Get Back Tonight" act of live, identity-conscious music. In the clouds. Perhaps in the initial editorial director he was trying to confirm that the identity policy is the new Vietnam? Oh, how did Adrian Rich from him launch? The remy launch on the crowd is a nice touch, if you are in the Rich political position. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend it to those interested in the 1990s as a date, while radical feminists brought the academic triad of race, class and sex to popular culture and declared that human hatred was a "viable and honorable political choice." Where is Camille Baglia when you need it?
