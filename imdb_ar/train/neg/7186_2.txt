I'm sorry for all the fans, but this is a useless movie. Representation is bad, so it's wooden, over-distressed in the early fear factor, and does not work exactly. I think there should have been an evolution in the end, but it ended up being somewhat confusing. what a hell? The dude who was killing everyone was stalking? Try again. <br /> <br /> It is hardly authentic, and it is not particularly good as a straight line. That's something to say. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who did the cast work, who wrote the script, and anyone who thought about the concept should be fired and removed mercilessly. this movie. If someone puts it in a party, throw the disc out of the window and put a good horror movie, such as Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
