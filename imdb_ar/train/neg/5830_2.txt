Restriction fee 9. Abbey: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a buzzing movie? Are there only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Does Björk wear a giant furry house on her head in a false Asian ritual? Maybe when the giant turds are used as the backbone in the whale experience. Or, when you're ready to kill the composer to make a minimal copy of Philip Glass and still annoying? However, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most exciting modern-day movies. In 135 minutes, he adds to his claim by being boring to take off. I used to call the stunning colors, the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the film seemed to have been filmed for a documentary about Discovery Channel. So it seems they were trying to photograph their copy of P-ss Christ, but this will appear later. <br /> <br /> In fact, parts of the documentary were the best parts of it. The surface plot relates to a whaling vessel, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then, there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who have been welcomed aboard the ship through a humiliation ritual that includes shaved head shaving (think prank boy pranks), nicotine patches, and giant furry hats beta. Then there is mutual evacuation, cannibals, do not forget the strange giant. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney writes that this is about "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity." That's like saying, "If you do not get it, you're not creative in your interpretation, so I'm angry because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, this is the post-talk interpretation of that sentence and what it would be like if the film was post-talk. But, supposed to be modern art. Ie about the art itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's begin by interpreting all this explanation, right? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered any realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half of the hour involves pearl divers and building a giant slope. Obviously, the ramp is a symbol of the need to elevate yourself to any standards you have dear, and pearl divers are looking for wisdom pearls. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a box that looks like a raw whale. Clearly there is a raw element to predict. <br /> <br /> On board, they make whale fats inside the whale's shape, and they exit the fin part. They replace this spine and then a giant faeces. These are supposed to be the same movie situations. When they have fat, amusing but bad for you. When the spine is, the "important" part of the film, or spine is to be said. Then, the giant feces is the film's viscera, or when the film is nonsense. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships and are placed in strange humiliating clothes that have not been made by ARE NOT EVEN WELL MADE or similar, one of whom is suspected of running out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. So, they put patches on his head. They go to a ritual and get to know the ship from a wise Japanese man, telling them that the ship was hit by dew when another ship hit it; crash or cross, so to speak. This inspires Björk and Barney, who are different abroad, to start cutting off their legs and eating them so that they can become whales and become the same person. They intersect. Oh, did you forget to mention that this has been in Robbie Williams video? After that, the divers of the pearls return with their mouths full of the pearls of knowledge they have left falling into the design of the stupid Vine. Barney made it through 8th Grade Engineering, obviously. Or, maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and have you forgotten the distinctive Bjork score for ears? Sometimes this is hypnotic, but in other cases you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> The art film is one thing, but when all kinds of symbolism are designed in the hope of getting a reaction from people, it becomes a self-destruction joke. When does the line break between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bonwell often made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and / or amusing than this piece of garbage. Un Chien Andalou had the sensitivity to carry as many symbols as possible in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend this? ONLY IF YOU LOVE HIGH BAD ART Movies with lots of icons and flat pictures. <br /> <br /> D +
