Why do filmmakers always conflict with author's work? I mean, yes, you have to intensify things for the viewer's attention, but look at Anne of Gables. They did a great job of integrating important events into a coherent entity that was simply fun. I can not believe they chose to combine three novels together about Anne Avonilia in such a terrible mess. Look at all that they missed. . . Paul Irving, Elizabeth Small, Widows, Windy Poplar. . . The years of the university, for heaven !!! Would not it be nice to meet Priscilla and the rest of Redmond? Kevin Sullivan had to take things in one movie at a time, instead of mixing them together and collecting characters and events as he did. This movie was good, if you leave novels of it !! But the beautiful work of LM Montgomery is undeniable. This film was a failure after seeing the successful way that Anne Green Gables brought to life.
