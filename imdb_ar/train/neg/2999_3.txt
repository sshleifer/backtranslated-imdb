Last Friday's 13th ripoff, even featuring some of his own music! A group of young people gather for a small high school reunion and start slaughtering Jason Furheis. Could this be the nerd who were tormented at school? <br /> <br /> The Routine Routine is fun for fans of this genre, and has the usual T & A share of films if any. The end is more creative than the standard. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Categorization of violence / language, language, sex, nudity, and some drug content.
