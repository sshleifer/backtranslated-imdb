First seen 6/18/2009? 2 out of 10 (Dir- Pete Riski): A psychotic film about an unbalanced autistic girl being tested in hospital, energy flashes, and all hell collapses. I am frankly not sure about the intentions of filmmakers in this film. What we got within the next hour and a half (at least no longer) was a horror movie / twilight zone / zombie / crooked ghost that ended up really meaningless to the end. In the beginning, after a power outage, everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of ill-fated people, including the girl and his father. There is a typical annoying character, a creepy old man, a typical young man who resembles many festivals, and of course the little girl who attracts her main character. Random objects start at different times like the appearance of ghosts and monsters, which indicates that this time has stopped, and the dead because this small group is trying to escape from anywhere. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything in some way and I really hate how they used this girl and they hinted that she was the cause and put her in the hospital where taking care of people is really lame. We did not really find out what was going on, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to sneak in for an hour and a half, this is not for you or for any of the filmmakers. What is a waste of time? Oh really!
