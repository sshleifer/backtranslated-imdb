Many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The movie moves from one scene to another, and violence erupts in almost every one. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not shocked by the violence and have a movie without a fight where something is missing. But, please, not one by one. My response was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is something like a story between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the film I had closed it completely, I could not wait until the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best filmmakers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
