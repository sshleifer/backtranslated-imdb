Ah this film had a lot of potential! Exquisite B-quality actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I think someone in an unnamed marketing department has an idea. Basically, let's do some Legally Blond movies, but do it in New York. That great city of opportunity, strength, money and where everyone is hungry without heart and money. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, a small town Bembo, the brother of Owen Wilson and for whatever reason Andy Dick (just because of him should ignore this film). <br /> <br /> Storyline: <br /> <br /> A boy leaves a girl for New York, follows the girl, a cheating boy, and a girl stays in New York with her cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, exploits it, and resorts to it Another boy (Brother Wilson), together saves the day kiss. <br /> <br /> A few words come to mind when you think about this movie, that is terrible, awful, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic. <br /> <br /> Just do not watch this movie, you will be happy. One of the reviewers referred to Guantanamo and I certainly agree with him. This film causes shock. I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point, I see Simpson naked or very close. This will not happen, save yourself time and YouTube. You'll have a better sexy time! <br /> <br /> Editing movies is cloudy, acting is unbearable, and why are they using blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a cinematic betrayal that must be punished to the fullest extent. <br /> <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father character in almost every Jessica Simpson click and why there is no black or Latin Or Asian or European people in this film?
