I had heard (and read) a lot of good things about Weeds so much that I was looking to get hooked on a series of other fantastic cables (like Entourage or Sopranos or Mad Men) but slowly eroded with every episode I saw from Season One. (Did not make it beyond the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was not original and packed and the black image was embarrassing. Dialogue is forced, like writers trying to be very intelligent and be full of hip. It was a rare moment when it actually produced an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> Characters have never developed enough for me to care about. She was selfish and unattractive. I absolutely hated that adding a smelter (which should have been carried away to Catch A Predator) and removing Hods Cowen's daughter from the crew by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico was not original and Clichy, I had to conclude that the writers were testing loyalty Viewer. <br /> <br /> After the incident, I was less impressed with the characters and could not go over many of the technical flaws in the story line. <br /> <br /> I also heard that the second season was not good, so I lost all my motivation to continue watching this play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of writing and sound good, I think this offer will be a challenge for you, unless of course stuttering and then all bets are parked.
