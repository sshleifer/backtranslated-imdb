I have just rented this movie to watch Dolph Lundgren, which I have not seen in any films since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was very disappointed. The behavior of all parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren, who was fine. Kata Dob√≥ was a nice thing to see in spite of her ridiculous clothes and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not smart at all, it's something that has been repeated many times in different movies. The crooks were a perfectly stereotypical figure, and Lundgren had no depth in them. I did not really expect a cinematic masterpiece, but unfortunately, this is not a decent procedure. Every turn in the plot is very predictable and an incredible amount of realism and incoherent comic scripts began to stir me up very strongly very soon. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to young children who want some comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current vote rate of 7.0 with 6 votes should be influenced by someone involved in making this film)
