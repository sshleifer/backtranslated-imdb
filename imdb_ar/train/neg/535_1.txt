Some of these viewer comments are silly. Is not it painful to see you with your other important character? I apologize to my friend for the entire film. <br /> <br /> He was slow and strangely strange. <br /> <br /> Neither Ridgreaves, Vanessa, and Natasha were fit for this, especially with Vanessa making the ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Dance was the same bizarre thorny girl in my life called My Name Life. She did not press herself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only parts of the movie to be retrieved, and it was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear by God, I got out of the movie screen and slapped me awake. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Claus and Eileen Atkins were both terrific in their two-half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a very good film, it was very nice, the settings were impressive, so it gave me the comfort of the extreme boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's pathetic when a film with "The Greatest Actresses of Our Time" takes so much. She certainly had more than a few notable editorial errors, and her main character (Ann) was a huge jerk. I was happy because she died. But that's because I felt bad about Lily, Anne's girlfriend - most of them because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathetic. <br /> <br /> Not a bad job, the evening of the movie. She was not amused and was not thought provoking. I certainly hope the book is the best, so it did not waste too much time people. 10/03
