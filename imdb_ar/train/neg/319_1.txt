A friend of mine bought this film for Â£ 1, and even then it was greatly exaggerated. Although great names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and incredibly talented Port Young appeared, this film was as funny as taking a chisel and sliding it directly through the earloop. He uses tedious comic techniques from the bottom - constantly breaking the fourth wall while Sandler talks to the audience, and apparently montage of "hot girls". <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays the role of a bartender on a cruise ship who wants to make her a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's comedian - dubiously dubbed "Dickie" - is supposedly ashamed of his unholy success with the opposite sex - lost in the sea, his character in Sandler Stichker gets a big break. My uncle was not dead, he was trapped in the bathroom, presumably sick of the sea. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was from his mouth that he vomited from the worst film of all time.
