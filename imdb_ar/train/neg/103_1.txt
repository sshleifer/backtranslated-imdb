Without wanting to be a criminal, Brad Sykes is responsible for two of the most hideous and cliché films I have ever seen - this one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The representation is terrible, the print is poor, and everything about this movie screams "Seriously, you can do better yourself". Maybe this poses a challenge for everyone to saturate YouTube with our zombie-related crap? <br /> <br /> I bought this for £ 1, but remember, you can not put a price in 71 minutes of your life. It is best to avoid this turkey, even at the price of the basement.
