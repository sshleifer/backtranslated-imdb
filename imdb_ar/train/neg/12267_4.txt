Just talk as a film, I did not really like it. Not because there was not FX or because we had one booth as a scenario for the whole movie, in fact that's what I was watching. <br /> <br /> I did not like it because the acting was shaded, his "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take distinct roles, one is the believer, the other is the opponent, Start! Also, the lighting was awful and I only mention the technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the thing you could get was the movie "OK I'm here!" Of some characters. Like a lady who does not want to hear his Bible. <br /> <br /> About the same story, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is evidence of some good writing and imagination. I support the author of the book for it, therefore, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I hear the story of an incredible or incredible man, just do not spend the whole time acting as you think him and shocked at what he says, while walking around and making jokes like you do not believe. <br /> <br /> Cohesion. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading;)
