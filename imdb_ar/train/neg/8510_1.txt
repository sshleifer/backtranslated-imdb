When we were in middle school, some of us boys sometimes blew stink bombers. It was considered funny then. But the producers, directors and actors of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in your local video rental DVD section) are adults who still blow them up. <br /> <br /> Like the previous reviewer who asked if the team was anxious to get out of the house and home, I doubt that more than one shot was taken for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, famous for "Mighty Aphrodite" and other films that have been evaluated, seems to be selling herself this project. Its representation does not exist, often confined to sad stars that are supposed to indicate the extent of its "sensitivity" to the plight of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - do not be the next victim! Stay away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere is not many good shots of Mira (the only high points I can find in the film) and the supporting actors are of poor quality, offering a mix of bad dialogue with embarrassing "Spanish" accents that deserve the best high school drama production.
