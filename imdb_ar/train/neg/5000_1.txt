Maybe this is the worst excuse for TV shows, since I do not know, what is happening now? Nothing happened at all in this ridiculous "chain". Although Britney and Kevin have shot them mostly, you do not get any good details in their personal lives. They often throw a stupid little talk, acting like a white trash. Look, I love Britney's music like the next girl, but this show is just stuff for a nation so addicted to Britney that they'll see her fingernails (yes, this may be an actual episode). Praise be to Allaah. These two men were separated because they were both together. This show is toxic!
