SPOILER ALERT In the action film The Blind, Lorenzo Lamas performs his usual hard work / beautiful boy, and his real future life, like Kathleen Kinemont, is the ass kicking Alexa hot chick. Or J. Simpson is an investigator infiltrating his inherited public personality. Translation: Cable TV Filler. There is not enough skin to characterize it as a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The program contains some fast holes. Best / Worst Moment: In one of the tense scenes, the OJ partner expresses his dislike for the surgeon. OJ responds that some objects are too hot, or words to that effect. This ambiguous dead sign is offensive enough; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film, it is truly shocking, and therefore entertaining in an unintended and terrible way. I was so surprised that I laughed until I came out of my nose. Now this is a guilty pleasure. B.C.
