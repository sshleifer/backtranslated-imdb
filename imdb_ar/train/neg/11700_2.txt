I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after watching it I was very disappointed. It was the best thing when Stephen King was in it. Robert John Burke can not save his life nor can anyone else. Some of the performances made me laugh out loud! The film was not as I imagined, after reading the book that was wonderful, I imagined it darker and more terrifying. If you're Stephen, I'll be really crazy! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just discover that the pie has killed your daughter, will not you feed it to anyone else? <br /> <br /> Your book was much better!
