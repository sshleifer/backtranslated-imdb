Why do people who do not know how a particular time in the past feel the need to try and fix that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and Apollo landing on the moon with Titanic sinking and you've got a realistic click like this Formula Soap opera completely inhabited by a low-life trash. Would this not allow children who were too young to go to Woodstock and who failed to form a primary school? "I will show those old meanings, I will get out my film and prove that you do not have to know anything about your subject so you can make money!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing I saw in this film for me was to give me a simple idea of ​​thinking about the lower class. The next time I see a slut in a pub like Diane Lane, I run in the other direction. From ill-treatment of children allowing parents who do not have child rearing. From the misuse of the public simply paste Woodstock and moonlanding in a click as if this fact meant that the film depicts 1969.
