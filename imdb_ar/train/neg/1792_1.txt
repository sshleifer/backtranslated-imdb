Let me start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. I can suck (meaning har har pun), and I still love it because the vampires are gorgeous in movies. Van Helsing, whom many considered a heap of nonsense, was pleasantly surprised by the presence of vampires. You might ask, "What's that got to do with this film?" The answer is that I intend to tell you how wonderful this film really is, so that even the harharhar sucker of vampire films like me could despise such a film so much. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Van Helsing, a young college professor is not convincing at all. He is a terrible actor, like anyone else in this film, he has written, to add salt to the wound. I honestly do not mean to offend him, and I'm sure everyone would enjoy making this film, but watching it was really painful. I'm not sure why I saw everything; it was probably a wonderful spell, like watching an impending train crash: it's terrible, but you can not force yourself to look away. Her main fault is that she is too boring, and her plan is too fucking silly, even for horror film Sci-fi. <br /> <br /> But I go on. By the way, Van Helsing fucked his mother. Of course, he does not know her at the time; he only thinks that he is one of his students (who is still illegal and all of them, but not disgusted and creepy). <br /> <br /> If you are Vance Helsing, I'll pull at least Oedipus when I find out. I have done something terrible. I've made one thing amusing if I have made some comments on it, but no. This point was not put at all, by any of the characters. It seems as if the writer did not think about it. I would laugh at least from other characters and say to him, "Ha ha, I have sex with your mother," which is somewhat funny (though immature immature). Maybe space ran out of room, so a few other words to discourage you from seeing this movie at all: there is a ninja vampire battle with an old man. It would be funny, but filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It is not worth watching the film to see how damaging it is. Stay away, away from it if you appreciate your time at all. <br /> <br /> I will say one positive thing about the film: the person playing with Van Helsing is a beautiful spot with a knife. There is such a long, delicate piece where he swings around his knife and performs some elegant tricks. It would be boring in any other film, but here, unfortunately, was the most important thing.
