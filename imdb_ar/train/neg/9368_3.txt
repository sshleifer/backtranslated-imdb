O mysterious actress once in a film playing the role of mother of a child. I'm wondering if ... Yes, you should hand it over to TVM producers, not content for a single film industry. They usually give us two modest films where two themes are mixed together and there is no place to hide. The first topic is a woman in danger subject was vaccinated with a woman suffering from the pain of the subject of divorce which means that we have a scene from the heroine survived an assassination attempt followed by a scene after she made her son Sam ask why she broke up? As TVM, she replies that the reason is "people change" instead of saying something like "I'm right" or your father is doing public toilet trips for men's sex, as in real life divorces. His parents are divorced, but he is as thick as two short tablets; in fact, because he is so stupid, he deserves no sympathy because he does not know that a man who ishes toilet things is a drug dealer, unaware that you might die if he shot you, That I love LUCY is painful, if our childhood is only innocent, Ahwell also said "ignorance is strong." Sam suddenly an expert Surprisingly, Sam Boy did not notice that if the story was set in 1994, why do people often wear clothes, drive cars, and drive trains from the 1950s? During a plot twist it's the mother that is a doll.And then there's a last plot twist left me feeling like I'm a fool to watch this
