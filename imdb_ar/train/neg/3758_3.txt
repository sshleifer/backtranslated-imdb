When I first saw this film, I thought it would be a good film. Usually when you have these types of movies, there is usually one sasquatch, but in this movie it looks like what? 7 or 10 of them? It was good, the plot was fine, I loved the scenes where the downer killed the first few victims, and they worked well in the camera. I was expecting it to be a great movie but it was a little too. This film was much better than Sasquatch. SCI-FI really needs to produce more sasquatch movies, I mean I really liked Mount Sasquatch, Abominibal was not good, the channel I review is fine, but the film Sasquatch was not, but I do not review that let me get back on track . This film is good to spend the afternoon on a rainy day, but on any other occasions, no.
