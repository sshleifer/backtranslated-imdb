The play by Liliane Helman, adapted by Dashel Hammett with the help of Helman, is a curious project coming out of the witty Warner Bros. film, Paul Lucas, where he returns to Broadway and won the Oscar for best actor and plays the role of an anti-Nazi anti-Nazi leader fighting the fascists dragging his American wife and three children. All over Europe before they turn to the states (across the Mexican border). They settle in Washington with his wealthy mother and sister, although the person staying at the palace is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and has fun at the German Embassy to play poker. It seems that it takes forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the essence of this article is (the wise, honest refugees who teach ignorant and ignorant Americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems to care little - Place relatives, where a lecture is given. Lucas made several speeches in the third season, which he won without doubt the Oscar, but seems to have done little but much of the picture, but entry and exit and entry and exit. As his wife, Beth Davis talks like anyone else and works her eyes wide to achieve a good advantage, but the role does not allow her too many colors. Their children (all with different accents!) Are alternately cheerful and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald does not play as a married wife (and the disgruntled mix that she brings to the part seems completely wrong). The intention here was to show our taste, tactfully, just because the man (World War II) might be Germany, and that does not make him sympathetic to Nazism. We got it in the first few minutes; the rest of this film consists of tasty and tasteful exposure and defensive and pathetic encounters in the end. The mixture should be mascara, but instead dry and dry. ** from ****
