Perhaps this amazing chaos has put the kibush in Mr. Burnagh's life as a Shakespeare transformer for cinema. (Released 4 years ago, and I have not seen a quick look at the amendment since). I just finished watching this on the cable - Holy God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the feeling of the references below that he said that reviewing something very badly and sadly sad is an uncreated act that happens to be noisy. However, I will take the risk, just because Love's Labor Lost * is the perfect reward for those who have overrated Mr. Branag's abilities in directing in the past. Prang has always been a very poor way out: a literal mentality; a star beating her. The unpopular truth to fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but he loves himself more, making him sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> In this way, the sad truth remains that Love's Labor Lost is hardly worse than the apocalyptic, ominous, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996. In fact, it may be a favorite movie, if it is about 1 / 3. Branagh decided it would be good to update Shakespeare's early bad work to Cole Porter's environment, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Yada Yada. So he put it in 1939, leaving about eight text without any explanation in favor of the horrific interpretations of the standards of the 1930s (wait until you see the actors rising on the wires toward the ceiling while "I'm in heaven"), cast unknown actors to dance or sing (included himself). The result is such a surreal disaster that one has been left so shaken that it did not call for an awful stop to everything after looking at the first daily newspapers. I do not blame the cast. To reformulate Hamlet, "script is the thing!" No one can do well in this podium: the bright RSC graduates are no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could have acted in this thing? <br /> <br /> First Branagh's mistake was to think that Love's Labor Lost was a well-deserved play. Trust me, not so. It is an anomaly in a cold law, explicitly written for a group of educated learners - not the usual audience for whom it was written. Thus, there is a lot of precious play (and TEDIOUS!), References to modern school nonsense, and the parody of Lyly's * Euphues *. . . In other words, hardly the kind of material to attract a wide audience. Hell, it does not attract an audience that is already set up for Shakespeare's comedy. The play can not be played without cutting text too much and the "update" is hopeless by any means of gimmick coming at hand. Which begs the question, why bother? <br /> <br /> The second Branagh error was to think that the creamy Shakespeare pie from a play could be served in a side order of Gershwin marmalade. It is clear that the idea, or hope, was to make an Elizabethan exercise unrecognizable to the modern masses through the management of American pop culture nostalgia in their throat at the same time. But again, this begs the question, why bother? <br /> <br />
