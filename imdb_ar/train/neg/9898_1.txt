This copy of "Moby Dick" is insulting the audience for allegedly being based on Melville's novel - it even amounts to showing a fake phrase in the first chapter instead of "calling me". In addition to the horrible representation, even from John Barrymore, this is probably the biggest example of how long Hollywood (especially Hollywood early) will go to review and change a famous novel just to enhance its box office chances. Ahab has been transformed from a crazy man, blasphemous, obsessed to a frustrated, misunderstood hero, just wanting to kill Moby Dick after his fiancée (!) Turns him away from seeing him as a wooden man. In addition to this brother, the standard villain who wants his fiancé for himself, and a different end!
