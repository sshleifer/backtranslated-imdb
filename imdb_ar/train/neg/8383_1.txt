...Start. This is the bottom. I'm not kidding. The theater should have been a warning of some kind. "Giving up all the hope you enter here" was appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have the exact words I describe in this film's hell. Her stupid stupidity even fails to entertain. This film certainly aims at some slow turtles in the sand box. The story was blatantly stolen from a 10-minute cartoon of Bugs Bunny and then stretched like Mr. Fantastic into painfully painful 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Wayans game was funny. I think Hollywood's pressure to produce products is the reason for this, which comes out at a steady rate. I'm sad and I'm offended because they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of jokes with a thin conspiracy based on a caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not like almost anything about this film. Nothing will spoil anything but the child is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wynes weak on the dwarf's body. What she did was the end. Not the film's accuracy, but the actual finish where we all stood and stopped. <br /> <br /> This movie was given one star, but obviously it deserves less. I do not feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script deserve the star. This is worth the Razi and I pray to God to receive it. <br /> <br /> When will people learn; if you stop paying to see this stupidity, they will stop sterilizing it. Seabuco is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
