Is Elizabeth Taylor rich and sick flirting with the angel of death in her island castle in the Mediterranean, or is she overreacting - or more accurately, over-estimating - as usual? In fact, both are applicable to Joseph Lucie's inordinate chaos, called "Boom," which is aptly titled because anger in the lush and luxurious atmosphere is about to collapse. Richard Burton climbs Mount Taylor without a call. She was wearing a full samurai dress with Saber. Despite its broad appearance on the widescreen, the picture is deadly, but failure even if Linz Dick Feyles has to avoid the "collective" star behavior "What the hell!" Towards their careers in the late 1960s is rare here). "Boom" is a disaster - although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his unsuccessful play "The Milk Train Does not Stop Here Anymore," was totally fond of it! * from ****
