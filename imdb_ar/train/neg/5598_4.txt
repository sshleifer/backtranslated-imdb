I saw him at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Festival. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Although I appreciated the best, I liked it, but it seemed to me that this act was a little ... weak (I often noticed it from the little boy's family). I mean the script was not excellent at first, but the actors did not make me believe the relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked. Favorite characters, the plot is not difficult or troublesome. She is sweet, the characters are interested in each other, and I do not consider her fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
