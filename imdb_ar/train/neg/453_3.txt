Well, first good: Cher's performance and cinema. Although I am not a fan of Bashir, it is an excellent performance and its part is well written. The cinematography was well done and met with a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> The rest: a high-profile, Nicolas Cage's performance, a non-lethal and utterly weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time I opened the cage of his mouth I crouched. I do not know what kind of dialect he was trying to use. I honestly did not, certainly did not have any New York or Italian accent I ever heard. It was very surreal. It was not because I insisted on some accuracy, his voice was in my ears. I love Nicolas Cage in other shows. Second, this is a purely storytelling story, but I have many relationships, friends and Italian acquaintances in New York City. Frankly I got more laughter and I was even happier in appreciating the Italian ethnic family to a great extent from this film. That would be a dull night at home. What fails.
