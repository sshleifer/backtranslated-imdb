Want a big recipe for failure? Take a plot, add some poorly developed characters and throw in the worst special effects of the horror movie. Leave the soup for a week (the amount of time you spend most likely in making this garbage). The result is Corpse Grinders, a film that transfers bad movies to unusually dangerous and low places. <br /> <br /> The movie blew out completely. I can not say how painful it is to see him. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit in and enjoy. This is not Plan 9 of outer space. This is a long time waste, sad. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I feel frustrated when I realize that people have used a lot of their lives to act in this shit, if you can call it acting. But again, when you have a weak direction, poor writing, everything is lousy, acting is the last thing you criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a disgusting, eager-to-get-out-of-the-moment, out of fear that a friend or family member might see it one way or the other. I really am with that I can destroy every version of this film in some way, so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring directors. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new respect for every film I've ever seen. I have explained to me what is really terrible and why I appreciate all those movies that are just crazy or boring.
