I hated this film a lot and I remember it clearly. It's not so funny. Any film based on terrible sexual jokes and racist humor is not worth the money it costs. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a can of milk. All I thought was "worth it, because he made a bad film." Do not waste your time or money on this one.
