Horror lovers (I talk to people over the age of 12, although if I'm under 12, I apologize for what you might see as an insult): In short, if you think your imagination is disturbed by well-written original stories, Predicted by well-planted concerns, which are presented through convincing presentations, then I can warmly recommend - avoid these hooks - by directors who have apparently been long since their sale by date. It is no accident that almost every episode feels like it happened in the 1980s. Do not directly blame the shoulders of some of these old boys (or indeed the 80s) because we would be without certain films like Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Parker (Active Clive, WTF) happy? To see the happy Romero had a good feeling to give Miss as I'm sure he asked him to participate ...). Perhaps we should point the finger at the creator, Mick Garris, whose credentials include the logic that defies the ill-fated television show of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining". <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is an indication of the state of television today. Are we too hungry for TV horror so good that we salute any old dirty episode produced by networks on our groups? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Normally, I will not see the benefit of adding a comment that does not argue about the drawbacks and advantages of production, but I set it up accordingly. However, since this series lacks the sorrow of any feature (perhaps with the exception of the only melody of the attribute) write this warning over the review: Do not waste your time and money. If you do not agree with me, it is more likely that you have not seen enough of the proper horror. Previous films by some of these directors may be a much better place to start, but if these "masters of terror" are evaluated on these works alone, they will not be allowed to graduate even with a bachelor's degree. Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University of S ** r.
