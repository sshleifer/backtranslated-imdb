I am known to fall asleep during the movies, but this is usually due to a range of things, including extreme fatigue, warmth and comfort to sit and eat a lot. But on this occasion, I was forgiven because the film was nonsense. The development of the plot was fixed. Slow down and boring. Things seem to be happening, but without any explanation of what was caused or why. I admit, maybe I missed part of the film, but I watched most of it and everything seems to happen on its own without any real interest in anything else. I can not recommend this film at all.
