While watching this movie I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time it was real fun. When my wife came to Sweden she looked at the old subjects and she laughed very well. But this American version must be renamed and never show again. It's terrible from start to finish. How they can make it so bad. Well I think someone is blaming the translation ha ha ha .. but it is not close to Pippi. This movie may never be seen again and has not been sent to the stream. Burn the movie and save the kids. If you want to take a look at Pippi, check out the original movie and enjoy the laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, will never stand to be Pippi .. Oh yeah .. When reading the explanation of "spoiler", "spoil" surprise and steal scenes of thrill and enjoy the film. "Well, I think the director is standing on this ... You're looking at this film at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
