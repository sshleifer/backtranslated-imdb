*** SPOILERS *** Let's begin with the "good" of this film - the effective representation of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the representation is terrible (this is not aided by the terrible text). The worst culprit is the villain, Pontao, the head of the Asian Crime Guild (played by France Tumbuan). I was laughing at my head as he expressed his "anger" for losing a handful of money; terrible performance. Patrick Moldon was not much better, and his "It's a hostile acquisition" (this is the rest of the title) was delivered badly as one can do. There are no other major characters, but no other actor / actress has his / her advantage in this film. We then come to the plot. This must tell you everything you need to know: In the original movie Rage and Honor, Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, is a teacher in the inner city. Now, it's Si. Which. The agent (or had some other government agencies - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what this C.I.A. The application process was like. Announcer: What is your previous career experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Announcer: Well. You are Tenant! I just give it a "2" because of some decent behavior and misrepresentation of a nice plot in the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be arrested).
