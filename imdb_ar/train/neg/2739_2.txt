I have no idea what he was shot at, but you can certainly say he does not have a budget. Bad acting, horrible cinematography, lame plot, and some decent special effects do not make a good film. Will make you cinematic style WWF cry ... Where is the tripod?! Directors aim high, but missed their pain.
