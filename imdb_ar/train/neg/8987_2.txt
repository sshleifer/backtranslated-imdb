The quality of the replacement of this film is the only true story ... Otherwise, this film was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the design of the group was very cowardly and cowardly. The story was decent, but it was very hard to watch because of all the horrible behaviors. I do not recommend watching this film ... The only quality in this film was that the actors were pretty attractive ... especially Ryan Power, the man who plays the soap opera star. Some adjustments have been made well, but there are continuity errors everywhere ... I'm getting sick and tired of watching bad gay films ... Can we get a good movie soon?
