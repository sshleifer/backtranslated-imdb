I have seen this movie for years and have been affected ... but then again I was only 12 years old. I recently re-viewed it and wanted that time. This movie is very bad while I love Lee Majors and Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to see a good movie that was in ... from Meatballs (also Bill Murray) to some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, / Did nothing for their profession. <br /> <br /> In any case, Franklin Hart, the character of Lee Majors, a former race car driver plans to drive his own race car (which was stored) all over California. One problem: the government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was good (not the worst I've heard), but the implementation failed horribly.
