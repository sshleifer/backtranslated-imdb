I honestly had fairly high expectations when I first started watching this film, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (which is not short). I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, made it several long pages, filled it with description, and did not intend to read it one day, or may drag and lose its attractiveness, which Emma certainly did. Now the "mind and passion" was out of this imbalance at a slow pace, but at least it had vital lines to make up for, plus some good performances! <br /> <br /> This leads me to Bug # 2, which is of course representation. Although I do not care about anyone involved in this film mainly, I'm sure he can do good, but I have not seen much of it in this film. It was as if people were trying hard to be smart, and it was very difficult to be "top class" and it was very difficult to be British (well, some) so they all came out only as a group of actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3.As I said, the actors looked like they were just actors, not actually like the people they were playing. This may be a good thing, because the people they played with were not very good. Why is everyone like Emma, ​​for example? She was certainly nice with the rich and handsome people in front of them, but they were chattering behind their backs. If her friends were "ugly", she did not bother to stand behind her. So why is this girl so big? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to laugh?" Of course, the imitator could not do it correctly. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow like Gwyneth Paltrow, and Emma did not change my mind exactly. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not care about that. I'm sure it's a nice book and everything, but actually some books are not on the big screen, and Emma is one of those books.
