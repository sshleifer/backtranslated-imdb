The story of Anne (Anne) on her deathbed and her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past. The memories of the past relate to a weekend where Anne Ann attends a wedding party for her friend Laila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will affect her for the rest of her life. During all the ups and downs of her career and family, she was remembered as her true love. Her daughter Constance is bigger, more "responsible", a mother of two and has things together. Nina moves from boyfriend to boyfriend and from job to job and is unsure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The detail period in the film is wonderful. Dresses, hair, cars, homes, etc., really put you in time and other place. There is some good representation in the film. Vanessa Redgrave is good at portraying her main character and fragile mental state as she ends her life. Claire Danis is beautiful and does a great job as a main character when she was small (she is a wonderful singer). Hugh Dansi brought a lot of life to the brother Lili brother friends. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad, which is unfortunately everything else. Things break down the story constantly as it is revealed to us. Chemistry between young Ann and wonderful friends. They have fun dancing. Then ... you're supposed to believe that she does not really love him more than a friend and that his harassment only bothers her. I thought that it was all "probably a lesbian", the thing was unclear and did not serve a purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. Personal wooden work and creepy. If this were another thing, you would know that Harris was the serial killer from the beginning. It is not reasonable to think that all these girls loved him very much (but they see other men as very lame to try to help him). <br /> <br /> The biggest problem ever. Why not meet Ann and Harris? They fall for each other. They are having this wonderful night of sex in an old gardener's cottage, and they come home to see the tragic end of Budi, then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet after a few years, and I look at each other and I could not help but wonder why. why? The film does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people, so I had difficulty feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The story's part is pretty boring right now. Clich√©th daughter of good and Clichy daughter bad. Nina is changing throughout the movie but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what makes her change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the girls connect in conjunction with Anne's old dream of chasing a butterfly. It's really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes," Anne advises. The statement is not true with the story. This is not true after watching the film and wished not to miss the talent of these good actors.
