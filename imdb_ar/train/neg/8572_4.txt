The story is related to brothers from a small town and their struggle for family honor. David Morse is the officer in charge and the "good" brother; Figo Mortensen, the "bad" boy, is a former soldier and a former convict. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have adjusted his performance in style. When you first turn the writer and director into this unrecorded drama, he writes the script and characters through the same methodological process, slowing down the speed of crawling (ostensibly so that we can capture all the finer details). This approach may be great if there are 3D characters interested in it, but Morse and Mortensen photoreceptors are not really convincing as brothers. Worse still, we expect more prominent veterans Charles Brunson and Sandy Denis, who barely get a chance to overcome anything interesting. The image is transient with rigid sequences, a wobbly and confusing narrative (always tilted to indicate technical overruns). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, yet they are often irritating. * 1/2 of ****
