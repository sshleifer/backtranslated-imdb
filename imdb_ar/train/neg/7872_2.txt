Anyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! This shows you every mistake you do not do in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I can not write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" is a very good family comedy with funny jokes and cults, this sequel reproduces the recipe badly from the first one. Funny parts can be calculated on one hand and perhaps half of them. Clavier is exaggerating her role more than the first round, as Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because she replaces her) but this is very strange. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin Rubin! Even if Moriel Rubin was funny on her own stage, she is not in this film because she does not behave as she acted. I know it should be difficult to replace someone who was good in a role (Lemercier got the Cesar Award for her role in the first film) but made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played ?? Job'! For the story, it's too much! Of course we knew at the end of the first film that there would be a sequel but Bory and Claver should try to write a simpler story like the first episode. Gags are frequent, childish and déjà-fu. No, in fact, there are no more than 3 funny parts in this. The only good things might be fashion and some special effects. So you only have two reasons to watch it: 1) If you want to know how to edit a film awfully, 2) If you want to waste your time or if you really need a "non-reflective moment"! 10/02
