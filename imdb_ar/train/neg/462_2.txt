This should be reduced as one of the worst movies ever. The representation is awful, the script awful ... the points were good! One to definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to detract from the fact that her behavior is just plastic! I sat ready to give him a chance, hoping to get better, unfortunately, did not happen! If you choose between this and a book, I suggest you settle down for a good read! I like Dennis Richards, and that's why you gave me this film, but why you allowed herself to be made in this film is beyond me
