You know what you get when you buy a holmark card. A vulgar vulgar verse, would be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same thing with the movie Hallmark. Here we get ninety-year-old Ernie Burgnine, who has retired to tell us that he really did not die as we thought. Poor Ernie, it's the bad spirit that married Ethel Merman several years ago, and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this case, Ernie jumps first and depicts the grandfather who is associated with his long-lost grandson. We've seen it before. You may enjoy this movie but please do not say that you are not warned.
