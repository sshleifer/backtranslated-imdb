I was not really fond of the first movie "Cube". It was a good idea, but the annoying behavior and personalities always kept me from admiring her so much. I did not really feel the need to see her sequel but when I heard that they were making a third film it would serve as an introduction to the original. I was fascinated, thinking they were likely to solve some of the original problems and provide us with a group of memorable characters. Well, I guess I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts well enough by introducing the two characters responsible for monitoring the maze of never-ending traps that infect people in Cube. Filmmakers can create a sense of ambiguity by creating a daily routine for both men. Many questions are created, about why people are sent there, and the true nature of the people who run the entire process. All of this is left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak, but his movement in the first half of the film was relatively good. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, an "observer" begins to raise serious doubts about what he is doing. She later decided to go and help a group of trapped persons. Here everything begins to melt quickly into a dull cowardice. <br /> <br /> It was sent by the people who run our Cube program to Jax. Along with two of his bushings play a major reason why this film is a failure. To start the look of "Jax" and the conversations in a third-class excerpt taken directly from James Bond's full movie with the ever-popular glass eye, which alone destroys any atmosphere created at a relatively pleasant pace in the first half. What's more, it starts to feel like a comedy more than a serious movie. With some incredibly stunning lines, the scriptwriter probably felt bored and did not care. The representation itself deteriorates to a low level when the former "observer" meets the group in the cube. The whole interaction is very painful as with anything else that follows. <br /> <br /> Once again, failure to influence anything but weak characters, representing dialog and imaging "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those looking for a horror film.
