I do not know ... maybe that's because I'm Brazilian but all those things were too much. Lots of love for music, lots of concerts, lots of contrast between the nice life of the main characters (come on, it's not too sad) and the city side that the director showed. Everything seems very fake to me: families, relationships, music and "happiness." It simply sells a little taste of the fake Latin American culture. I have to be frank: I am a little seduced, but who will not be tempted by that fake life made of beautiful music, sex and concerts? I'm not stupid: what kind of world does people suffer from diarrhea, extreme sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene through a call to the mother of Caridad and discuss the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
