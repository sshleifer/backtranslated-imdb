"Greendale", directed and directed by Neil Young, is more than a 87-minute music video that has been set on a collection of works by the songwriter. Instead of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's words, which are full of social and political commentary, to the story of "story" while actors act in scenes. <br /> <br /> Due to the camouflaged displays and the lousy image, the effect is to substitute Young for blowing up some of his own home movies and launching them for public consumption. Although there is an alleged "story" in the film, however, we have no idea what is going on, mainly due to the uncolored appearance of the film, the lack of dialogue and amateur incompetence in acting. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a group of retired hippies who silently mutter through an incoherent novel while Young's songs play on the soundtrack infinitely. Everything turns into an arduous exercise in self-immersion. "Greendale" is making reputable films outside of Hollywood, a bad name.
