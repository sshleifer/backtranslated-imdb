For the most part, On Demand offers some horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies that everyone has already seen, and they already have an opinion. This was either or not visible (I like Mark Wahlberg films), which I have not seen, and I was actually watching a moody movie, which has not happened much anymore because I've already watched all the movies I own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, Big new movies, boy, this movie made me feel sorry. I will not put any spoilers, I will just tell you that only a few of the FEW representatives in this film, fairly decent. I think the main girl, the dead girl who kills everyone, looks very annoying but convincing; I took her in the mental whore any day, so she fits her well, even though she's lame. Blood is not so great, just a few dead, or I might say that "wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there are no props from the body in the film to make the injuries seem more convincing. Near the end of the film I was asking my girlfriend to turn it off, and as a member of the band, the "recording" parts were not too interesting, although what actually happened was when you made the recording. I finished, if you want to watch this, fit yourself.
