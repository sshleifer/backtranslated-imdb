That's what the title should be, anyway. <br /> <br /> This film combines guns, explosives and tireless killing to make the movie "The Movement" flounder. Let me clarify my point of view in a series of questions: Deal type answers. <br /> <br /> What happens in the film? People die. <br /> <br /> Is that it? Yeah. <br /> <br /> What is the plot? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point the film tries to make? Murder is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? Very flawed and contradictory towards their personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes really. I'm sure they used some fantastic Panavision cameras to shoot them. <br /> <br /> If you like constant murder and greed, watch the movie. If you come across low-level entertainment, Made Men is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, the drawing line stinks, the characters do not deserve their time, the story story can be completely resisted, and there is nothing to suit them. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and those who contributed to making this film are definitely "not made."
