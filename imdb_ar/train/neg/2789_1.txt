Savage Island (2003) A lame movie. It's like taking home video with minimal lighting and terrible acting. Not only was the story and the texts miserable. I do not know why this film was made. I've seen lots of clicks in my time and the movies I really hate are the movies that get me mad. This one make my blood boil. The positions were crazy at best. If you make a film like this, it was short. Really because those "wooden pits" will not be present in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover on D.V.D. I'm an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this film is virtually unrealistic. I do not mind shooting at the movies, but if you do that to make the movie fun, there is no tiring reload of horror movies (without error). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend wasting this disc. If you encounter this one in the leasing store, go to it. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you very angry get an automatic copy.
