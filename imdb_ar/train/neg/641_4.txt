As far as I know, Largo Winch was a famous (never read) Belgian caricature that recounts playful adventures, a kind of James Bond without a spy life! So, when I had to pick a movie for a 5-year-old boy, I picked it up because the kid was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But, after the opening credits, I got big doubts: when American films make a startling start, here, no activity or strong sexual scene? So, the story is very complicated with financial moves ?? I thought I lost the baby. <br /> <br /> But, oddly enough, he was caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was the excellent explanation for Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship between Largo and his father? A multi-square story where friends are bad guys, bad guys are friends? Exotic sites of Hong Kong, Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dono, but he is really interested in Largo ("Will he wake up?) and we enjoyed our moments.
