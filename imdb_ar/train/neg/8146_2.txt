First seen on 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): A great movie for the gang-head of a family like the Godfather in Brooklyn likes to say a lot of four-letter words and kill people. The only thing that is interesting here is their attempt to show that the federalists are very much like the gang. This is the only attempt to make a good film. The rest of the film was predictable, cheap and pricey. The quality of photography in some scenes inside rails and floating joints makes you think there is a problem with the DVD player because of the bad contrasts and it was difficult to hear some actors sometimes because of the bad sound. The acting was largely representative of all your favorite gangsters with best-loved films such as Vinnie `Knuckles' and Jimmie` Tattoos, and the plot followed those patterns to a great extent. So, go to watch the best movie gangs before you put your money in this movie.
