I will be vague about my potential pampered comments. There are enough canned items in this movie that have been pre-configured. <br /> <br /> This movie draws some ideas from Classic Classic, to Kill A Mockingbird. I assume that TKOM has gotten its ideas from some source .... Anyway, after you see this, you'll say, "Oh yeah, that's the rip." <br /> <br /> I think this is really the fun thing about McMovies is that once you have identified a plan element, you know whether to stick to the original or try to misrepresent it. There are not many transformations in this one.
