For me, each piece of art is judged according to these criteria: shape, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be devoted to the forms: wonderful shots and sometimes fun acting. Long closures suggest a function that the viewer can fill by himself. Because there are no texts the story becomes a quiz. The introverted person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say. This film serves as an introverted person. If you do not read the summary, you will not see that suicide (and the unanswered question why?) Is what changes our view of life and makes it suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me?" Asks Sebastian. Anna does not answer, she just starts looking at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? what do you mean? My question is like Sebastians: What does this film say? What is meant by this film? The answer for me: it shows us a bunch of people who have a passion for a glass of water. Their life story is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: leather, housing and landscaping. Nice and artistic to do, but meaningless without getting rid of "instructions for use". In my opinion, this film was produced for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.
