This program bothers me! There is no teaser for that and so dangerous to be called "fun"! It's just too educational for my liking! The characters are very stereotyped and unattractive Unnecessary plots and ethics are repeated only over and over again. Where's the fun in it? I also feel that this has been on the BBC for a very long time and is being broadcast a lot. Do you really need to get a slot on the T.V screen every two to three months when the display runs out completely new? I think it's time for the BBC to start rolling out some of its old programs like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons, and Count Duckula. I thought the BBC where to restore Danger Mouse, what happens with that?! 10/03
