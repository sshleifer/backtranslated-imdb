Unfortunately IMDb does not allow me to rate judges less than 1. What a shame. This awesome movie is so bad that I've already turned off the damn thing before the show ends. There were a few bright moments in the script, but routing, editing, acting, sound quality, and especially the timing of online delivery was so disgusting that judges were not at all tolerable. <br /> <br /> The judges were advertised as modern day Western style comic book, but in reality it was something like that. What looks more like a dog tube is at the bottom of your shoes. You can try pretending it is fine, but it continues to stink. <br /> <br /> Why do video shops think it's good to carry this kind of nonsense with static gaps in sound and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than it is on television. But the judges are worse than the most pathetic SciFi channel. I plan to ask my money from a Hollywood video.
