Imagine you are a high school boy, at the back of a dark theater not crowded with your girlfriend. To what extent should the film be so bad that you feel compelled to leave the theater and return home before it ends? This movie is very bad. really. Movies often become so bad that they are good. This film is beyond that stage of bad faith. It's very bad. Horrible, terrible, crime against humanity is bad.
