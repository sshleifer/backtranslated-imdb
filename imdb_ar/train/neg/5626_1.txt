This film caught on a Sunday tube. I thought it was so bad, I searched for it on IMDb to see what other people thought. I was not surprised by the number of ridiculous people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the Hated It categories just to find that they did not exist. I am always shocked at this; I always look at hate because they are always those who hate a film no matter how good it is. Somehow I made this movie through the salsa by the hateful saying both of it and proudly announced that I hate this movie! I know I should go into the details about why I hated this film, but doing so gives this movie more respect than it deserves.
