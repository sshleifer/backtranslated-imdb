A foywonder review for this cheap STV hits the nail directly on the head. Be sure to read it. If they do not, a group of scientists will go to the depths of the forest in the Pacific Northwest to walk around with a group of bones in a graveyard for animals. The Big Foot family does not like this and moves on to one team after another, largely outside the screen. Big Foot himself has a monkey-like face, but is generally less scary than Harry of HARRY AND HENDERSONS. Most of the film has two wooden actors who pretend to be scientists wandering the forest and wandering away. It's a budget-free film that happens very little, at least on the screen. We notice that the most attractive women are female while one of their male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.
