There is a little spoiler below, which may spoil the surprise of one unexpected and really funny scene in this film. There is also information about the first movie in this series. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on DVD, which someone presented as a gift to my roommate. He came as a group with the first film in the series "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This film was definitely much worse than the first "La Noche del Terror Ciego". Additionally, many features of the first movie have been changed dramatically. To boot, the movie was named in English (it was the first subtitle), which I tend to find its attention. <br /> <br /> The concept behind this series was that in the distant past a local branch of Knights Templar was involved in hateful and secret rituals. When these crimes were discovered, the local peasants executed the "Templars" until they no longer used their eyes, thus preventing them from returning from hell to revenge. We then move on to the modern age where the temples are raised from the dead for some reason their revenge on the villagers who were corrupted by their ancestors in the first place. Of course, because there are no cavalry without eyes, they can only find their victims when they make a noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secret system, dating from around the twelfth century, out of the Crusades. They existed for about 150 years, before being suppressed by the pope and others in the early 13th century. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their celebrations, especially for the initiation. Also, given the way in which the community was organized, you do not necessarily have church officials overseeing things, which means they did not have an inner man when the heat increased. Because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured in confessions. The ranking was stronger in France, but it was in Portugal and Spain, where the movies were going on. <br /> <br /> The first film has a virgin sacrifice and blood-drinking horsemen directly from the body of the Virgin (breast shots here, of course, this is a horror film after all), and then, once the cavalry return to life, they attack their victims by eating them Alive and absorbing their blood; in this sequel, all this disappears. You still have the same scene (reconstructed, not the same footage) of them sacrifice the virgin, but they drain the blood in a pot and drink it. So, when they come back, they break into people with their swords or claws to death, and that's what I'm saying is a less effective way to disturb your audience. There is also a time problem: in the first film, acquaintance is closer to the "Templars", where they now say it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants who burn these men at stake, which will determine their history in 1473. The Templars lose their less interesting eyes As well. In the first, they clicked from crows. Now they are simply burned, and in a very ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, maybe it was me, but there seems to be a lot of people from the first film that appeared in this film (despite his death). Not really a problem, since the film is completely different and not complementary in the sense of continuity, but not strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is a rich colleague who uses a distracted child while resting in his pocket. This archetypal man had raised the child's father before to try to get a jeep, so he goes out and asks her to find her father. It comes somewhat of a blue, and is easily the most extreme scene in the film. Of course, the reason for the death of the child at this stage is far from me, and his disappointment to the lovers of terror. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can not recommend this movie to anyone. This is not so bad that it becomes funny, so it ends up as a mean horror sponsor. The bulk of the film contains many people holed up in the church, each of them trying different to go alone to escape the blind dead who surrounded them. When the film ends, I will not be surprised at the result at all; in fact, very disappointed. If you're new to seeing a Spanish horror movie, check out the first film that contains at least some innovative ideas, not expected results.
