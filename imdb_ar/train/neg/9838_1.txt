This movie is awesome. Nice scenes killer or not, the representation is really bad, as you can say they read their lines from the card. With a painful line delivered by everyone in the crew. He thought of watching a play in a high school and complaining about the apparent lack of smoothness in actor interactions (a strange pause between the lines of different characters, along with the delivery of a hasty line by others). If the movie is complete, it may be overlooked, but much of the film includes plot preparation, Family Guy style, and unanswered errors (oh, wow, poorly done). I suppose they were trying to be funny with them, but once again they set off with a group of high school students / college students who set out in the afternoon to try to make a funny YouTube clip. <br /> <br /> Now to the scenes of fighting. It's not too bad, given the level of quality we see anywhere else in the film. Nothing great either, and certainly not anywhere near the same level that other posters mentioned (nothing like Drunken Master). The battles have an exaggerated feeling, with many cuts at different angles with starkly different positions on the part of those involved. <br /> <br /> In short, the only reason to watch this movie is if you are one of the friends of the man involved in this very cheap production. The man you might ask? Oh, the same person who wrote, produced, produced and stared at this masterpiece in the preparatory stage.
