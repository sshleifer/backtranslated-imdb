It's very simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humor that targets teenagers and young people, with an unorthodox sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully clear that in the end, they were desperately trying to make it the last ten seasons, most likely to say they defeated Seinfeld in season nine. The problem with that, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, and friends (and I was very vine here) were in over 5 or 6 good seasons, then 4 bad seasons. <br /> <br /> The soap opera with recycled humor and recycled personality traits that were not very good with the beginning, then got worse in 100 times I saw them. I find it very difficult to understand why people appreciate it so much. It's really awful.
