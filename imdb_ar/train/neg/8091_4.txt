(This is a review of Disney's subsequent English release, which includes Alison Lohman and Patrick Stewart and co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this film to be good. really really. I am very impressed with Princess Mononock and El Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing comments about Miyazaki's previous film, I was excited to see him. But I was shocked, shocked to say, the quality of this film. These subsequent films boast well-planned charts, 3D characters and best music since ... well ... at all. This film does not come close. <br /> <br /> It may also start with positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this film is still very creative, with an exotic fantasy / science fiction setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast some very superior animation for other films of its time. (Although it is not as beautiful and sound as the subsequent Miyazaki movies) and the sound representation in English is very good. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... not ... well ... the characters are all cardboard - from the sweet little Nausicaa of Saccharin, to the villain Tolmekians, to everyone in between. Once you see each of them for 30 seconds, you'll see everything that exists. The fact that the plot intertwines with each other does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there's music ... Now, Hisaichi delivers my favorite author, but Nosika does not do justice to him. Half of the music is keyboards in her 80s, which usually enter and leave abruptly, distracting attention from the images rather than helping them. I suspect that Hisaichi was asked to compose a lot of music before he saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's a wonderful message with this film, right?! Let's all save the environment! It is very bad that this film hits you over your head like a heavy hammer. There is a scene where there is a tree Nausika. Later. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It's a pity to talk about how awkward this film is. But for some reason it seems that all the other reviews on IMDb adore it. When characters have to talk to themselves in long sentences to let you know, this is lame. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind who adore anime, enjoy the music of the 80s, and plant a tree every day from Arbor, you might like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for his subsequent movies, as they shake a great time.
