If it is not for dialogues and bad texts. I mean the trend has been in constant contact with its subject. The actors were doing a good job in bringing their characters back to life. But in the end, the really missing thing was a solid text to tie all the parts together. I would strongly suggest not to watch this. Unless you are a Al Pacino fan like me, I will watch everything that plays in it. Even if the result in recent times is bad. This is, after S1m0ne, a very bad film for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
