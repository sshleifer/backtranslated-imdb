If you can believe it, another group of teenagers will be back on the shores of another lake three years after the death of one of these fatal "accidents." Low, a psychologist wearing an embroidered hockey mask (a cheap piece of paper in it) is wasting them one by one. This mechanical game "Friday 13th" gained a bad reputation as one of the first features digitized, but this is where the interesting facts end, and all that remains is predictable amateur production with substandard performance and a recurring intermittent remix. A second development does not raise morale, and Memorial Day is the best thing to do in Lake Wensi. One of the only crazy collector collectors.
