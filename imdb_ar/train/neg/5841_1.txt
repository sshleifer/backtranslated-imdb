The spoiler below, but continued reading or will never know the terrible fate that awaits all people planning to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night, at a remote research lab, an important medical breakthrough has fatal consequences. Chemical compound leakage was created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells from the hazardous waste disposal system to the basement of the building. Now, rodents are not involved in the laboratory experiment on the top floor and are the only mice in the establishment that will become species changing. Professor Schultz, the lead biologist, has decided that the addition of a new enzyme is now possible from the "catch and destroy" formula to renew the length of time needed to neutralize cancerous tumors. When three different degrees of the new mixture are given to three different rats and the rest flows into the wrong "Waste Hazard" washbasin, the horrific side effects lead to a night of terror ..... right ..... <br /> < > Seriously, this may be the worst film I have seen this year. Everything about her screams "low budget!" , From the terrible representation to the special effects that are the worst I have ever seen. Characters are common symbols and behave in predictable, stupid ways: walk in the dark corridors alone, search for a cat, stumble and fall so the "rats" can catch up with them, ride themselves into a small room, etc. <br /> <br /> While some movies are made cheaply, this film really takes the cake. Every possible angle is cut, everything from the re-use of the previous footage, and the filming of the "lab" corridors from different angles to make it look bigger (and this reminds me - why only two of the men worked in this strange huge building?!?!?!?) To music and special effects that can be done on a computer workshop for children. <br /> <br /> This leads me to the worst side of this manure pile - special effects. Just appalling. Computer-generated mice look very fake and stand out in every scene, so even the dumbest movie buffs can see that they were born by computer. That giant rat suit - oh my lord !!!!!!!! Seriously, are you supposed to believe that the little fat child is a monster? Just pitiful ........ On the better side, some bull looks fantastic, especially given the budget. <br /> <br /> All actors suck. No one involved in the production cared or knew what they were doing. I've wasted enough time reviewing, just take my advice, it's rubbish. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transfer process absorbs, the sound is acceptable and there is a path to comment on the disc by the manager and two of his friends who say they have nothing at all making the film but there was to ask questions And make comments. The three of these primitive mud without human beings are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can hurt themselves or others. I do not want to waste more time or a nice time for the reader, because I started to remember more about what I want about this film ..... DVD Rating: 1/10.
