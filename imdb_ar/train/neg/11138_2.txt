Let me start by saying that I have read a number of reviews before renting this film and what I have known. However, I was surprised by the extent of their harm. <br /> <br /> I admire the big wolf, and I used to forgive a lot when watching one. Most of them have substandard effects, misrepresentation, and weak stories (at best rephrased from previous films). So far, with the possible exception of some of the subsequent "Awaa" series, this is the worst. <br /> <br /> First, the story. I have been moved several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is very clear that the author (s) had absolutely no rapprochement with non-eccentric monsters. As often happens when a horror film is presented to the writer who considers himself the "highest" such fare, they try to come up with a new spin on the bewolf mythology. This is good, but a fan of terror who tries to do so generally ignores the intelligence and development of the horror audience and ends up writing to them. The plot seems like a parody of the films of the wolves, and the events that are just so false that I felt that my intelligence was seriously insulted. For example, television news clips do not interrupt the reporter to take a look at someone in the crowd behind him. Give the characters and viewers the chance to be able to spot the bad person in the scene without using a flashing neon sign. This is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I have not seen the weed less credibly. I was happier with the color of Chani Junior in the crepe hair. Looks like the monster they used well like ... well, like a man wearing a cheap rubber suit with some sticker hair and some really scary animation. I know that many people have already criticized CG, but my God was terrible. One scene features a woman changing, and starts issuing a CG entirely to the actress, who is nude but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, "Hey, why does one of the characters of ReBoot turn into a silly-looking wolf?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd love to look for positives in any movie, and there was a little. Cinematography was acceptable (the film was filmed in full digitally, which is interesting) and some of the performances were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the best homeless woman in the world, and Ken Hodder as a bad man. Also, Yellow Power Ranger has grown and ... Well, damn it. If you're looking for a skin, there are some delicious examples. This part ends the male pig in the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a well-done film, try "The American Wolf in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers" or even "The Wolfen" (although the person has Wolf more than it was). If you have completed the lycanthrop, take a man. Otherwise, give this one a miss.
