Doris Daye never allows bad texts to drop it. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out safely. This comedy, perhaps inspired by the blackout of New York City in 1965, but borrowed from a French play in the late 1950s by Claude Magnier, does not give Doris much to do but a parody of her good second-half, Today the spin gives to this situation). There are some funny lines here, but it is clear that the magnificence of the material has been moved from the play ... Instead of evoking some entertaining events inside Big Apple, we stumble into the suburbs. The stars participating in Doris (Patrick O'Neill, Robert Morse, and Terry Thomas) are not well suited to her, and the hairstyle is shapeless. However, it is not terrible, it is characterized by a few big laughs, but for today's fans, they must be seen. ** from ****
