If this is supposed to be a black experience, let me get out of the front or back door. <br /> <br /> A mama boy sees one day that there are two little swans walking back and forth and then forth, all this down the hill. Angela Bassett, the shining grace in this film, plays the role of his protective religious mother. Despite her anger of his life turned, in the middle of the picture, I really decided to accept it. She allows his friends to come and suddenly, all the right to use abusive words as long as they are not in front of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad situation with regard to rap bands. You know where this movie is heading. <br /> <br /> She laughed loudly at the end when Basset was accompanying her son's body for burial, and says that while his life had shortened at the age of 24, he became a man. What man? He was a convicted criminal, wrote the most brutal rap music with continued vulgarity, and disgruntled society. This scene in the classroom where the teacher tells that as a sanitation worker, will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what is happening in our schools. Complete lack of respect and teacher's teacher. <br /> <br /> The full rivalry between the east and west coasts of the West Rap Coast has not been explained. All we see is the burning guns. <br /> <br /> An awful picture that does nothing to prevent gang violence. What terrible models these rapists are are their foul music. The American-African community must feel happy about its presence. Who was this fat-free slub who pictured Baiji? Making Rerun from the old TV show looks thin compared to. I know that it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this fat little kid into vulgar monsters. What a sorry situation when this movie entertainment is called.
