Watch all the stereotypes and misinformation I've heard about the semi-faithful Mormons, and you'll see that they played a leading role in this funny excuse for the film. Finally, Kurt Hill's fortunes have changed, and we hope it will be a long time before we see any of his features in the theaters. <br /> <br /> The film industry was amateur (I think they used a video camera for some basketball scenes). The plot was lame and very ridiculous. You really did not understand why anyone did anything. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and the lady was weighing 300 pounds on my face and it was painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason not to give this movie a negative rating is the scale will not allow me.
