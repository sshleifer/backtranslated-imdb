Heavy morals. They use characters as trumpets to talk about themselves. Predictable, plodding plot points (say that five times quickly). Britney Spears. This movie contains all special rejection characteristics for life. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that Jesus Nepot and Julia Montju have begun to create a passionate emotional film about a difficult subject, to explore the idea that things are not always black and white, the criminal is by definition not necessarily a bad person, there can be circumstances Diluted, especially when one puts the welfare of the child first. However, it seriously ends up being directed to a preaching dialogue and cliche positions that have been moved to trigger the plot. The proper production values ​​and interesting use of documentary camera footage is not sufficient to achieve its objective when the text and representation are flat. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised in order to create tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo to participate in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape, then at the same time basically tells him that he does not trust her because she does not help them overcome On altruism. Well, Duh. For the fugitive, Pablo is deeply moved by a tantrum. Christina's welfare is so important to him that he flees, captures or leaves the family, but is willing to risk all this to satisfy her when she does not want to go to Mexico. right. Talk over excessive parenting. Thirdly, when Pablo's employer, Charlie, gave the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her age - did she really think she was convincing? Oh, yes, I had received myself. CCH Pounder's investigators could have cleared the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to mention the things I liked. Um, I loved the dwarf. I like the fact that the dwarf was named sexy. There is dressing, always a plus. Events across dressing, do not say! Harry is infinitely cute from Christina. But it must be my favorite moment in the film when Christina launches detective not Bright. I also find it interesting, in a crowded minority figure (much more aptly, by the way), that the black character is the racist character. Too bad, just put there and not explored further. <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive and unconventional degree, but it is not generally context-specific, and does not enhance mood or tension in any scene, except for pathetic weeping and ache every time the main character is in a state of distress, as if they Believe that his representation does not appear enough: "Only if you are not sure, he is upset, we have a musical cue to prove it." <br /> <br /> Discordant and claustrophobic dialogue results in a frustrating lack of subtext; everything must be clarified in the dialogue, even if the language of the body is over, and then conveyed well. For example, every excited speech Pablo shows, and Mrs. Knight's lament that her child will not crawl into bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> "Bape, tell me about Mama again" - what a shameless, stark gallery introducing a dead wife in general! (She's always the prettiest woman in the widows, the kind she's ever met, why can not we see a man crying over a woman like Shakespeare - you may be fat, ugly, hateful, but love him deep in the ocean? .) <br /> <br /> Police are always one step behind them. Many scenes give us a feeling far from a French farce. Most of the boring foot chases at all - Bright & Lightning are very old and easy to deceive (it certainly is not as fast as lightning, which is also, I do not feel the need to clarify things). Does someone pull a young child out of a bike, complemented by a macho biker in a fight but then dropped by a child? In Margaret Chu's words, this is very sad. Will we see this at any time on "cops"? <br /> <br /> Disinformation and Machine Des ex machina: As an employer, do you give up checking his green card just because he can quote an inspirational author on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> In addition to many scenes, including the above, threatening to move to the porn: "Well, I'll do this for you, as long as you do something for me ..." I can almost hear bowm-chicka-bowm When the parents see snapshots of Pablo's remorse, the mother's sad whim is the most realistic the film feels.) Unfortunately, this diminishes because of the fact that she seems to be deeply influenced by his emotional speech until it becomes The most obscure view will be more persuasive here. <br /> <br /> I am in constant fear of the stupidity of the main character who is doing things for the plot: owning a small shop without Why do not the mother recognize his face when she saw him before he left? "You look familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this scene that is totally unnecessary and somewhat unjustified? With Soid and the industrially enhanced waiter, the development of personality is very little, too late. <br /> <br /> When talking about unnecessary features that never go anywhere, the investigator's "dubious" Lightning "detective Shining "must be" Scorpio "shows how little he knew about magic. I do not believe that faith in destiny qualifies as a voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright Pablo carries a die - wait, why bother now? Her personality is inconsistent like Sweden. What, she should shoot him just because she said "stop, or will I shoot"? (She was interested in _so_much_ about her safety so far.) He was unarmed. There is no need for lethal force. What is wrong with shooting him in the leg to obstruct his movement? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's childish acceptance of her mother's death gives Dr. Knight the peace over his daughter's death - very compelling. The competition of the family that killed her child to become the new Christina family ... bothers me that they can be a "substitute" for their little gestures. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to take a Latin daughter for the man who killed their daughter. I'm not saying that there are no generous and loving people who would do that. I just say that the characters here have not been developed at all enough for me to believe that _yhe_ will do it. <br /> <br /> I find it insulting that another IMDb reviewer said that of course he was a woman who was moved from the happy scenes. I am a woman who keeps my emotional movements for moments that do not remove wax in an emotional way. <br /> <br /> Nepot, co-author and co-author, said he wore many hats during the production. Many chefs may spoil the gravy, but one chef may end up alone to make a special after school. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the title of this film is not related to stories and more to the story. The sense of regret, helplessness and loss associated with the revelation that you will not see your money again.
