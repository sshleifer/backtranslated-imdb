This movie is hilarious, not in a good way. The fights have been badly bad, while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, and certainly not enough to call it "shocking". A gun battle means that the hero can walk in an open field with 10 people shooting at him through uzi, picking up a gun and starting to shoot again and not hurt. <br /> <br /> The empty story, the man who wakes up, has lost his memory, and fighting begins because that's what he does. Five years later memories come back, taking vengeance on Apple. <br /> <br /> Not worth your profit, your time is really worth it unless you are drunk and bored.
