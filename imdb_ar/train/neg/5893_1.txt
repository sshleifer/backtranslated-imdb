This film was a wonderful and amazing film through Hell. I mean it bothered me as much as the pulse, information technology, omnipotence, etc., but with a wonderful film comes crap? right! These films were ending pathetic things. I mean the ghost is back in the house chicks and now think I did it and that means that I can call them and it will be a good time because they think it is as well. right? Error. My ass! I do not care if the ghost is the devil, this does not happen. It is a yes film but most of the evil films or films built like this aim to make them logical but they did not. He showed us what I just said and people do not think about anything. Can someone tell me why you did not notice that pitiful part? The film for me ended up in hospital and that's it.
