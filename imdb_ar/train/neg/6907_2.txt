There is no author writing here because it is not worth one. Not a technical film. Not even one of those "hidden" gems. As you know, like those movies you hear about through a friend who watched this stunning film in the city center showing all the good independent and artistic films. <br /> <br /> Just place it in the Christmas boxes and get rid of it quickly.
