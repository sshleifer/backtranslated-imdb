Who did the research in this film? He was caught in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern equipment. No one was wearing these things in 04. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie while posting it abroad and I can say that the predominant feeling of the audience was WTF? This film is meaningless, where the characters come and go without explanation, and people are doing silly things that will never happen in real life. I realized it was a film, but it was obviously trying to portray something realistic. She failed miserably, but she tries. <br /> <br /> It seems as if someone has come up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed and swallowed them, and then vomited a movie. I do not recommend this film to anyone. I'm still not sure why I'm sitting in everything. The GI Joe was the one who made you really think about this. stay away!
