This, for lack of a better term, the film is lousy. Where to start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinematography - this may have been the worst I've seen this year. It was as if the camera had been tossed from the camera man to the camera man. Maybe they only have one camera. It gives you the feeling that you are a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of random scenes that are put out without any continuity at all. When they did "split the screen", it was absurd. Everything was flat, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Color colors were far away. These people need to know how to balance the camera. This "movie" was poorly made and poorly implemented. <br /> <br /> The plot - you must be kidding. If you are an SS agent, I would sue producers. The Marx Brothers is similar to radios and guns. Sutherland was in his "24" position - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria was better off with more and more appearances. As the Bembo movement was not great. <br /> <br /> I could not see a real plot, other than Douglas harassing the president's wife. She never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the president. I just do not see the US president running away for his life in the tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has died. This film is the guide. I love the Big Screen. Since I was a kid. Many "movies" like this I'll be stop going. What made Hollywood, which made a lot of clicks in the chick, forget how to make a real movie? If I own a theater, I'll start playing old movies. The person who has real actors and good storylines - and good cinematography. <br /> <br /> This is a "movie" dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. I rate this "movie" zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but what he wants is to do it.
