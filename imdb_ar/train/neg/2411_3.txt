Hood of the Life Dead: revolves around the world of a young man named Rick lives with his brother in Oklahoma City where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother was shot dead by a gang walking in the street who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls on his global partner to bring the latest formula they were working on that transports diseased blood cells to health. The formula is not tested on a human, or even a body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is just moved back to life and feeds on human flesh. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother before the full cover turns into the dead. The hood of the living dead is one piece of garbage. The plot is a direct rip to Resident Evil. The behavior is terrible, especially with Rick's fake cry for his brother. The guns are very fake because each time the weapon is fired, the sparks are sent, and the makeup is lame. It's fake blood only covering the faces of actors. Zombies are also modified. They run and destroy and must shoot the heart to die! Zombies must only quarrel, whine, and must fire the brain to die! This movie is very terrible, and the results are the only real good moment for this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, and there's little entertainment here and there but it only works as a low-budget festival.
