What a disgrace! I was checking it out in the hope that James Garner's jewel would be undiscovered and what was stinky to be! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was lame and undeniable, and I can honestly say that I am two years older and more crowded now. The film did not really have any substitutions, and if this sort of thing continues, it will give Hallmark a bad reputation. For those of you who insist on knowing what the subject is, it is not about anything, and in this case, this is not a good thing. We have seen an old woman who is one of the dumbest creatures in the world, and who happens to be married to a true lover who may be the only one who can bear it. She makes it through chaos after another, puts it in awkward position after another, and prides itself on herself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! Not worth the time it takes to watch it, so prefer yourself and skip this person, you'll be happy if you know how bad this person really is.
