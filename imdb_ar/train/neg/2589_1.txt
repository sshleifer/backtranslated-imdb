For those who have little time on their hands, I will sum it up quickly, with one word ... pathetic. There are a lot of good examples of why this movie fits perfectly with this description. So much so that you can hardly pass within two minutes of the screen time without seeing something completely stupid and useless. Want a naked woman completely in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason for its appearance is meaningless though it already adjusts the tone of the rest of this piece of crap events. You can glance at the minds of 12-year-olds who wrote this piece of trash only by watching these craps they expect the public to pay for it !! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> I have seen many movie franchises recede over the years, but American Pie; Beta House should be one of the worst offenders when you think that despite the middle nature of the original movie, it is still a funniest Time of this dredging. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you already feel you are watching a school play. The things that happen in this film are so unreal that it takes a lot of suspension to disbelieve to actually watch it (we're talking about Star Wars suspension levels, like the kind you need to convince yourself that Jar Jar is real) <br /> <br /> The Thin Paper Plot Most of the events that occur there are just to show another pair of breasts or prepare another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get is a group of beautiful boys who try to make us laugh. And how they failed! Every freak falls and the only thing I laugh at is the extent to which the screenwriters do not understand. Otherwise, how can you interpret bulls as they try to pass a story? <br /> <br /> They miss every opportunity to do something valuable and entertaining for the sake of the nonsense of the common denominator that is badly written. The characters must complete a certain number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House, but this is often handled through a series of very short montage that indicates that they complement the tasks, but we do not see any evidence. Actually happens. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. They also miss opportunities to be funny in doing so. (Imagine the words "Wizard of Oz" where all the important events took place outside the screen instead. All we see is Dorothy, who wrestles with the scapegoat every now and then and says "Gee that was definitely a great adventure we had at that time") Lazy. lazy. Lazy !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual supports during most of the movie. You will not be disappointed, presidents who are only looking for a T & A, but for that reason alone will be ashamed of you. If you purchase this on a DVD, you will contribute to the fall of the community in your own way. Congratulations.
