I thoroughly enjoyed the A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, scenario, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gail Sondergard in the role of Elk and Man, a senior Yeluhand tribe, does not look like an Indian, nor does he look like half of the other Indians, played by Italians, Mexicans and Latins with cheap wigs. The old man who played the leader behaved like an old squeak more fat than a fierce leader of warriors. So he used a bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who has done such a wonderful job, seems to be walking around this time. I think he could not resist the easy salary he got to revive his role as an idiot. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the film, such as Hors, who undergo painful cleansing rites to "find his vision" and gather yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, the return is uneven, Boring, gritty, predictable - just like most consequences.
