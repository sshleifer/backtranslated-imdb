I do not know what this other guy was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently makes it less horrible. You can be as locked as you want ... The majority of this film is starkly familiar. I feel insulted because I have to watch the first 40 minutes of it. This alone was not a small feat. Not only is the representation terrible, but the plot is not even close to advanced. There are countless holes in the story, so much so that you can hardly even name it a story. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here and its purpose is to just save all the viewers you have there an hour and a half of your life. I can not remember the last time I could not even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
