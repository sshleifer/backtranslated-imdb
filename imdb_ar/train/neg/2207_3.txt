Head Hammer is a combination of a mad world and the types of killer shark movies. In a little casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the role of the above-mentioned crazy world who develops a creature of the human shark / hammerhead. It is curious that this organism is actually his son who turned into this beast to prevent him from dying from cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of associates is invited to the world's own island. Eventually they are used as a shark bait or a fellow shark. For some unknown reason the head of the IT department was brought as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, it turns out to be a stunt hero, if somewhat overweight, Ramboesque. I'm working on the assumption that he learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of his daily job by working on first line support. A normal day for an information technology man is supposed to be to fix someone's network connection followed by an invitation to bring down the bad guys who practice weapons. Or should you schedule a call to fix someone's computer between physical encounters with hybrids that rely on the human shark? Anyway, it's amazing and saves the day. It is even the girl. <br /> <br /> The man shark creature is a bit lame but okay, I guess, if we judge the effects in general in this movie. The film moves at a decent pace. It's a whole game, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional struggles of a man turned into a wild killer, you'll really have no one but yourself to blame. As they are, there are guns, jerks and girls and maybe even a helicopter explodes. It's nonsense, but not as bad as some might say.
