This was by far the worst thing I have ever had. I feel dirty because I recognized that I hired this "movie" and already paid my money to see it. This does not even rate garbage. No no. This juice is collected at the bottom of industrial waste dumps located in particularly unpleasant neighborhoods after an unusually wet summer. To call it garbage would be to minimize trash everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register at IMDb and warn my male colleague. The luvahire character claims that this movie is awesome. One has to question his understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director imagines that his audience is swinging and shuddering in every sentence Ricky utters or explodes into an uncontrollable laugh at moments when most directors want a more sad reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did a great job. <br /> <br /> "I am a self-ambitious actor playing theater in my school and I had to play a play where I had to cry and it was not easy to be emotionally in a scene that gave props to actors who had to perform a passionate scene and could pull it." /> <br /> F. I also must offer props to actors who can take away the emotional sights of Luvahire, you may want to look at another line of work there are friends if you think these chuckleheads are pulled out. However, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. Ha. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> "Bring the string" <br /> <br /> If you are the theater teacher at school, you will fail to do so based on this comment alone. <br /> <br /> I am very disgusted to continue. I will now deliver the embarrassing film to my colleague, Mr. Bengali. <br /> <br /> Hello! If you still read this much, I consider it to be recognized that you have already watched the film, and you are now looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Additional additional degeneration for what you agree was an exceptionally poor film. 2) An additional degradation of what you feel has been a good cinematic effort needs to defend such scum libel. Whether you want to help express disgust or ammo to a moving party, if you say anything good, you will only disappoint - so let me assure you, there is little chance of such frustration. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments here in IMDb have already listed the specific limitations of the film (eg acting, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), but all these flaws can easily be forgiven, to the extent same. Few people will rent a film called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they need to be first class. The final failure of "Hood", however, is its failure to meet the promise of its name. "Hood of the Living Dead" practically jumps off the shelf in the video store with its implications for the evil eyebrows and murderous creative murder. There was a chance to mix cheese in the zombie film with real life in the ghetto, to throw zombie bombs scattered by the gangs into innocent life while Rockin made a breach, in order to get undead commanders to command over all the deadly lice in their narcotic rounds. A combination of both types can be hilarious. Instead, the film is like watching middle school kids handing out lines in a subtle way to a play they do, but they do not understand. To avoid the feeling of betrayal by their videotaped audience, I propose that the Cowroys return the film with a new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: a homemade horror video we filmed on our camcorder with some friends over the weekend because we were bored." Or perhaps they can issue it as a documentary film. "The Day of Creativity Died: Exploring how a low-budget film can remain devoid of smart or original thought, even though it lacks links in a large film studio." <br /> <br /> A potential tenant who has not been neglected should find the following error on the back of the video box: "The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things you can easily do on your own is not very interesting." - Mr. . Bengali
