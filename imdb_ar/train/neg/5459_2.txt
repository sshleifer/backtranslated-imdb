It was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Show" in 1971. The episode is starring Sue Leon (for the fame of Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, who plays as an incubator and a bloodbath, respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (who looks like a wolf or monster) while going out at night in search of blood. The babysitter is completely oblivious to the appearance of the vampire when she first sees it and begins to put only two and two together when he notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has a strange collection of books in the library on the unseen, and hears strange sounds while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what I thought was originally. She opens the door and the vampires emerge in confusion and end up. I do not know what the purpose of this short episode lasted only 5 minutes. They must have expanded the previous episode through the same five minutes and surpassed this episode. Fully lost effort.
