I just want to clarify one thing - I love Michael Vartan! But this film makes him come down. His representation is still wonderful, and still charming as always, and still looks great. But the film itself is a load of garbage! Natasha Hainstridge, I'm sorry to say so, she comes a little shabby ... You're always waiting for her to run away with her best friend, whose own story is a little strange. Myself and my family (who sat and watched the movie with me) were also postponed by the soundtrack of the film; sometimes the music did not fit what was happening in the scenes. However, this was not the worst aspect of what I found a very disappointing film. I could have forgiven the leading woman's thief, and I could forgive the strange characters thrown into the mix, and I could forgive the bad choice of musical accompaniment, but her choice was to cut the entire middle section of the film. And skip straight to the end ?? It is clear that the end was planned from the beginning, but how it is reached is not yet there. If you love Michael Vartan, skip this movie: Buy yourself a sticker instead.
