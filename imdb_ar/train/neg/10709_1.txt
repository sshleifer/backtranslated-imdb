I can not think of much to say about this film. <br /> <br /> It was a bad film ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to watch it. It had very few recovery features that I do not even know where to start them. My entire body was tense throughout the film because I could not wait until the horrible thing ended. By the end of the film, I found myself feeling comfortable. <br /> <br /> Editing was bad, representation was too low, and the story was weak. Fran√ßoise Robinson was portrayed as an authentic American, although she does not resemble a native American. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be stupid, it should be amazingly stupid - at least. Not so. It was just pathetic.
