<br /> <br /> This film (not a film - clearly recorded on a cheap camera) may be one of the biggest movie-hate bombs in history. Beware: The package advertises the click as sex exploration for sex addiction. The film is not exploring anything, and nothing more exciting than staring at the warts. The script is useless and lame, with all elements of the plot serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. However, even lame lame sex scenes. Except for the first, it is about three seconds long (and then again, perhaps my story has been cut) and comicly. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie, you do not want it. If you are looking for a sex flick, you do not want it. Whatever your life goals, desires, or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie. How they made Rosanna Arquette and Natashia Kinski and Ed Bigley act in this stinking bomb is very puzzling.
