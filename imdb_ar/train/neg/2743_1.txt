I must admit that I did not finish this film because he was surprisingly stupid and not worth watching. I saw it with a room full of children, who also did not laugh at dumb dumb humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be obsessed with manufacturers and genitals to the point where he really goes beyond the real story. This is not a good movie for kids! Besides the fact that the content is raw, the film is just stupid and has a bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you are younger and love it, do not waste your time watching a movie so bad it makes you angry. Buy your kids book instead.
