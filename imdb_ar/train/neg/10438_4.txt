Sucked the film, was not funny, was not exciting. They tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but it failed. Thinking about it is good to like this movie, next to the noise, are the only reasons for the success of this film ... <br /> <br /> The fact that at this moment 50% voted for 10 out of 10 for this movie seems disturbing for To me, either the film will become crazy or this vote is unrealistic and can have many reasons, and it must be dealt with. In any case, it is a less than average film that thrived through advertising from mouth to mouth. Success can only be described as a marketing marvel.
