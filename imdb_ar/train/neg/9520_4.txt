[*** Possibly the vandals ***] preceded the reputation of this film so, so I was expected to sat to watch it in a mailbox on TCM. What a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic and the production values ​​are first class, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on long. For the film, which deals with alcoholism, family divisions, treachery, gambling and sexual repression, the film is intriguing, curious, strange and talkative. One example of this is the portrayal of Frank Hersh's betrayal: his arduous request to his wife "to go upstairs and relax a little" followed by her predictable headache and, more predictably, his evening contact with his secretary ("Nancy, Blues tonight ... let's go for the drive "), all according to the worn-out formula. We do not feel that these are real people, but cardboard cutters behave in the Marionite game. Also, the source of the apparent friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has not been explored or explained. Dave's fascination with Gwyn on-again / off-again is inexplicable in light of her extreme inability to defecate or get out of the bet. His subsequent marriage of desperation to the character of Shirley McLean / Jenny is, from the moment she is presented to this scene, however, is doomed to failure clearly, and it was clear - through the agreements of this kind of soap opera - that it can be solved only by someone Kill. The moment the jealous lover started running with the gun, I began a brawl myself about who - Dave or Jenny - would be killed. Everything was fake with capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> After that, McLean's performance and Dean Martin's performance are ahead. But on the whole I find that the film's interest is purely part of the history of Hollywood.
