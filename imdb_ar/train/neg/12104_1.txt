Bill Maheruddin is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from the irony of a group of rabbis who invent distorted machines to circumvent Sabbath regulations, in fact he does not attack Judaism and seems angry when the rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he will realize that the establishment of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called "holy books" of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and absolute lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> I find it very difficult to believe that a man is an atheist or even so intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at him and describe him stupid because of their beliefs, but what do you have to offer them in return? Anywhere not really telling them why they thought they were stupid. What makes him a "rational" person in the room? Somehow reflects how it is not, and ends up in the process of searching with the same stupidity as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good documentary / film about the actual evils of religion and how religion can be harmful to human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins "the root of all evil?" It is a documentary that has been brilliantly researched and clearly shows what you hope to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's Religious is not funny, does not ask interesting questions, and gives no insight into a controversial subject. It seems to be the yelling and stuttering of an old man disgruntled by his Catholic upbringing. I feel almost sorry for him.
