I will not add to the plot reviews, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> A very unlikely orphanage in Pala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee in their faces. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful scenery. <br /> <br /> Good to know the face, I quote, "Look at the mouth, which is a casi of fools and horses." <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton Mackay was much better at rock rockers, and Keith Baron was better at anything else, and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Retrieve feature? It was free to watch Horror before going to sign up. I will not be involved in this effort.
