The worst movie I've ever seen. The first half is interesting with some engaging dialogue, among dubious characters in a late-night bar. The film then turns into a shapeless series of scenes that aim at visual shock (read with disgust) without any observations or lessons drawn in humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present in this show and his kindness prevents me from showing his disrespect. However, the time is precious (as the manager himself noted in his introduction) and I really grieve the time I wasted in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> The three main characters in the first half were the Allies. Of the film, especially female lead.
