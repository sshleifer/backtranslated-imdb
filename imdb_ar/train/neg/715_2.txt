It looked like a really interesting film. Nazis, ambiguous, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of DaVinci code or boys from Brazil or even shocks. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychologically, and something more like David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is horrific. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is representation. The personality of Andrea Barbou starts from being somewhat shy and afraid. She does not do it well, even at her age, although she certainly tried. The actor as the son thought it was a comedy. Most other actors seem to think this is a wonderful film, or at least act like it, rather than just being a stranger. The only thing I thought was really good was the daughter, Seri Baroque. <br /> <br /> Another big part is speed. It starts very slowly. Very slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then become convincing for a while when it reaches the girl's suicide and beyond. But soon thereafter, everything becomes a mixed mess. Some of it was intentional, but much of it was unnecessarily confusing, uninteresting, and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is simply that it's not a great movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the lovable characters. Overuse of photos and groups. Some of the films you watch are tortured. In this, it is the renderer who does. It does not include some horrifying moments, most notably horrible Nazi paintings and credits, but the rest of the film is often stressful.
