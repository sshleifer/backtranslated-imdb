Siskel & Ebert was fantastic in this show whether you agree or not because of the real conflict that generated their separate professional opinions. Roeper introduced this show to a degree or two because he was not really a film critic and he replaced snide with his opinion. Now, when Ben Leon comes, I feel like I'm watching "teen news" - you know, the Children's News program, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. Obviously they have only experienced a steady diet of major films throughout their lives. The idea that these two levels have any interest or as a result of saying moving pictures is an ironic idea. If they review a film without a formula, they are completely lost. Showed them something original and intelligent - they found it "confusing". Wait - I think I got it ... ABC owned by Disney ... Disney produces films for children. While Sisquel, Ebert and Rooper promoted independent films and only succeeded in producing huge budget studios, it is surprising that these two men love the studio's big studio and can only tolerate some Indians. Plus everyone knows that Age TV advertisers are aiming to achieve it. The stark favoritism is the ice on the cake. In what alternative world are these men classified as film critics?
