I will admit that I do not expect much from the film Roger Korman. Overall, I expect lots of walking and bad texts. However, in this case, I am very surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger is the story of a woman (played by her courageous Beverly Garland) who serves as police chief after her husband was brutally killed. Mrs. Garland is a very good shot, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Its first task is to close the local bar that violates the curfew in the city. The bar owner tries to buy the land in anticipation of the railway (hopefully) buy it. However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar chief employs a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Since Ms. Garland plays her role faithfully and realistically, there is no temptation at all. To go to the jokes Susan Summers "She's a sheriff." Except for a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens out from the inside, the jeep tracks, two horsemen waiting on the screen to ride the cue for them around the corner), the film becomes quite acceptable as a movie fare. However, Korman could not resist showing his film with scenes of horse riding, just like walking in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno says The Gunslinger is an opera for horses worth your time.
