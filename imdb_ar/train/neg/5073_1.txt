The Titans in the Tree of Palme try to pass it as a kind of symbolic story of a fairy story with real meaning, and then start immediately raving about the animation. I should have known what that means. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the entire film problem. In one minute, Palme is a modest hero looking for himself, a violent psychic with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once cared for. <br /> <br /> Like all characters in the film, Palme is poorly defined. You are not associated with the icons at all, although Shatta has got a couple of fan girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in mobilizing all the drama and complexity that can be present in this film than to explore the motives of his characters and personalities. <br /> <br /> New, useless story lines have been introduced in the last 15 years. Minutes from the film. The writer desperately needs to simplify his story. Maybe he was trying to be an epic, but he was simply a lot of information for a two-hour film. However, I can only wonder if the plot containing many dimensions and characters would be more suited to a television series or a photo novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the film, I simply could not bear the great lack of quality anymore and began to laugh at how prosperous the characters, relationships and conspiracy were all. I touched my companion and started cracking too, as the young man was sitting behind us. We tried hard to control ourselves, but simply could not take the terrible quality of this film. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is unbelievable and viewers will find themselves impressed by lush backdrops and charming character designs. Animation guides you almost; when you do not care about characters, it tells you how you feel.
