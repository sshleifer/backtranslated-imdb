I am really surprised at how good this anti-Christian documentary has been. Now, I respect the man's opinion and faith, and I personally am not, in this case, a believer in the Christian faith that has been taught. However, anti-Christian propaganda is somewhat different. <br /> <br /> This movie contains valid points, but they are very few and are represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend not seeing him. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide whether they think it or not. This is in fact more of an opportunity than the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of following the inquiry approach, it seems to be a personal vendetta of the Christian school that influenced his childhood. It often misrepresents Christians as either naive or fundamentalist, or moderate. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes from Passion of Christ without permission and interviews his school principal. The previous school presents historians and writers only anti-Christian. I actually found that the school principal is the most realistic person and I think his position is quite justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers interviewed had been consulted or even told the purpose of the investigation before the interview. <br /> <br /> With this, there are certainly new and interesting facts you should find here and some very original ideas about the question of Christianity. But the way this whole thinking is produced is often offensive, unprofessional and terribly biased.
