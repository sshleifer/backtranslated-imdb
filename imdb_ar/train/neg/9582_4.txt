This piece of feces together adds so many ridiculous scenarios that it is ultimately a laughing riot of sheer joy. Very bad because the premise bodes well (as often in Duhlywood), but in the hands of this screenwriter turn into la la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in a prison serving a DUI period that killed his mistress. We got to see him suffering from nightmares so we know he is very upset about it. Then his fellow colleague hung himself. Or is it? Louie has some doubts but drops them quickly. His doubts are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why did they raise him up to kill him? Ah, this is where this story can become interesting. This is where the bars fall off, and once outside the rails they decide they can get away from insulting the viewers attention for the next stunned hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not tolerate an endless recalculation of the irrationality of the following, but think about this end. Louis has surrounded the bad guys on the train. They want his tape, because this tape will raise their boss, and them. So on the train come 3 cops, pulled guns, ready to save Lui. The bad guys kill the police, in front of half the passengers then ... they continue to chase Lowe to get the tape. Hi!!!! The killing of 3 policemen in public places will make you in deep dudu, to hell with tape. However they go outside the mall shooting at the place, as if the audience did not exist as witnesses, and in the end Louie was caught and the bad guy still wanted the tape !!!
