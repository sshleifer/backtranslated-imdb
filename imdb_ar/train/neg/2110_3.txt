Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not misunderstand me, he's one of the most interesting people who make a film at all, but he certainly did his share of clunkers. This is just another one of these. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays the role of Dr.Lorenz, a doctor whose medical license was withdrawn for unknown reasons. However, he conducts experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. She has been revealed to be 70-80 years old, but it seems that Lugosi in his life in the mid-fifties, why not explain the fact that he married this old woman. <br /> <br /> However, these treatments or experiments that involve giving brides who are married at the altar a kind of sweet smelling substance are carried out but believed to be dead. Lugosi and some of his assistants then steal the body on its way to the morgue and return it to its laboratory where it is kept in a kind of suspended animation or fatal state. The stolen puppets are then exposed to a needle somewhere in their bodies, possibly the neck, and then the needle hits the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We do not really see where the Lugosi moves the needle or what he gets out of the brides, but he returns his wife somehow. You are always deprived of aging by the screams of pain because the wife's logos do a lot of screaming until you get back to her younger state. The help of Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing in this film .... A strange old hag and her two sons ... One big son A modest, slow-looking colleague loves to love puppies Snooze and the other son is a small dwarf Medium ... a small person , To be politically correct in today's world. On this three night only they pile up and sleep in the gloomy Lugosi lab in the basement. Who are these three and how they became fearful assistants to Lugosi, like so many things in this film, have never been explained. <br /> <br /> So anyway, a job reporter is given a job by them. Editor To find out where all the stolen brides will go in one thing common to all the stolen brides, there is a rare lizard found on them. So she wonders and is told that there is a world famous Orchid expert living nearby that happens to have developed this special lizard. This expert illustrated that Dr.Lorenz creepy. He stalks him quickly and disturbs his little house of terror. I'm not sure where the police are, but they went into the cleanup after the reporter did all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> Lugosi's films always seem to contain some kind of unnecessary absurd schemes that have made the whole thing come to the upper heaven. I mean a famous global Orchid expert snatching brides by sending them dope up the orchid is the same one that is known to have been developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> After that, it was revealed that young women do not even have to be brides to do the procedure. Why does Lugosi continue to kidnap brides from heavily guarded churches to his experiments and create them with all the attention and headlines? Why not just grab a whore off the street like a normal eccentric deviation would do? This is reminiscent of a lot of other loganic stink, "The Devil Bat" .... the same absurd plot lines and bad representation and the same ridiculous reporter "dealing with the bad guys". <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - it's creepy and evil enough to keep you interested at least by watching it. The woman who played the role of the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she did not have any emotion at all, she had just made her lines like a submachine gun, expelled them as quickly as possible. Everyone else blew up pretty much, when it became a good actor. <br /> <br /> But this thing is viewable, even if only for Bela Lugosi fans. Intense even when the image was a dog. He must know that he was doing terrible images, but he might also know that if he gave it all, he might shine out a little of those bad plots and bad behavior that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> The right fans ---- we are horror will always be love to gave Bella Lugosi.He it's all his Tim has been in front of the camera. We give you two, ** Bella.
