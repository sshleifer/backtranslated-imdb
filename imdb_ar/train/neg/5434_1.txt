Wonderful. What a terrible adaptation to a beautiful novel. Here are just a few control. - The screenwriter excluded two main characters from the book. - The plot was changed strangely. - Acoustics as if they were raised directly from written passages (which may read well but are not the same when talking, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The representation is more wooden than the log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - supposed to be set this in 1983 ?? It seems like more than 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it could recover itself ... (Ironically). I really hope that no one will pay for it, or at least anyone who reads this book hoping for something decent (no wonder Boise). I loved Chapon as a writer but should be ashamed of this amendment. <br /> <br /> No stars.
