Complete marks of the content of this film, because I am a British did not realize that there is a chapter in the US Navy during World War II. A very courageous attempt to convey this truth to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the representation is wooden and the text is just clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat down from start to finish in the very bad way I put them together. It could have been a great movie. For many of us outside the United States, the story was new, unique and interesting. The sad truth about this is how they were assembled. It is a pity that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, a poorly directed film. I only hope that sometime in the future, one of the main studios will take this subject and settle it.
