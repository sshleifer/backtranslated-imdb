I read the Chris_m_grant comment from the United States. <br /> <br /> "A great documentary about 1924. Iraq's geography in the early 20th century was strong," he wrote. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who care about Khaytari Nomads in Iran, the Zagros Mountains and the landscape and watched Grass, The Battle of the Nation for Life. These traditions, which I have seen in the film for centuries, have continued and will last as long as life lasts. I am from this region of Iran myself. I'm Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you but the Bakhtiari region of Zerdkoh is in Iran and not in Iraq, as I mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iran are different and different countries. The Iranian took an Iranian almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thanks, Zebra
