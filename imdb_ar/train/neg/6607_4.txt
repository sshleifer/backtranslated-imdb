Not as bad as some do, but obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was as great as the villain Baban Singh - try not to compare with Gaber in the original where obviously they would not have the same effect. Unlike some modest movement scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. The development of the character was bad and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and the loss of some information that I did not know if I had not read the back of the DVD tray. The worst part of the film was the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude named Prashant Raj. Nisha is just annoying from the time she opened her lips for the first time. For Raj Brashant - Seriously Who Is This Man? Where is he and why on earth was he present at the film studio for anything other than offering drinks? His ability to act is zero and has the same tone and the dialogue and strong expression in every scene, whether it is actually or comedy or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed more than I can say to his mistake in a companion. In general, the RGV's Aag deserves to be seen for the strong Amitabh performance, as well as the very exciting Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
