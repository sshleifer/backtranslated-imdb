The behavior of the moron and his girlfriend some rituals to revive the dead, trying to prove that the dead can not be returned to life. It is not surprising that they revive the dead spirit that began to be cut off with an ax. The next day, some college-aged people tell the story about the campfire. The man with the ax turns and begins to penetrate the idiots who tell the story. The group calls the police, and the policeman sees that the blood has been scattered all over the place and is believed to be a mountain lion (?!) And is soon being erased by a deformed assassin who may or may not be a ghost. A simple spray film was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters carry flares and speak as if they were in the middle of the night and want to send a bright signal to attract attention. One person has a pistol in his hand and bullets in the other but does not bother to load it, and then after he has finally loaded it, he has many chances to shoot the killer but do not bother, because this will finish the film very early and then throw the gun away! It is also harmful to characters who show no emotion and do not seem less worried after their friends are divided into parts and the effects are poor (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car that was finally blown was clearly a car model) and a terrible dialogue and some nasty nudity Really does not help. In the end, she tries to escape punishment by saying that it was the invention of the same college-age people who told stories of camp fire at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer becomes a reality in the final scene and breaks them into pieces. one more time. <br /> <br /> An average of its kind, just good for some unintended laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
