This is a bad-made bad version of the classic Parineeta in Bimalda. The story is based on the Chandra Sarat book of the same name and distortion of the original. Well, one can appreciate a certain amount of creativity but not shameful creativity. Impression is influenced by everyone and the whole film is a shame. Chikard's father's choice of words in the abuse of Lolita (Palan) seems cheap and sick and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shihar (Saif) Lolita slapped away completely with the flow of film and characters, is very controversial and easily avoidable. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Blanc is an entirely inappropriate film and a cheap stunt film to attract the audience. When creative work is unfaithful to the original and destroys its spirit, work collapses. The song "piyu bole" is fine. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene where Saif stands for himself and the rebels against his father. This is a positive exit from the original credit and is worth. On these charges this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Reka slaps from an artifact and they are put on. The song is wonderful, but I remember hearing it somewhere before, and if I'm not mistaken, the melody seems to have spread. <br /> <br /> Well, he agreed that times have changed since then. But after this film does not reflect until the modern era. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers become increasingly obsessed with persuading non-native Indians and taking over the lucrative NRI market. These films ultimately do not belong to India nor to any other part of the world.
