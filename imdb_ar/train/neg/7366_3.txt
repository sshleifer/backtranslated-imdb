What F * @ # Was this just watched? Steven Stopp !! Please! This movie is bad and silly. In a strange departure from the movement and adventure, Mr. Segal is now fighting (obviously) to be vampires "like" creatures with superhuman power.? Okay? Oh, their eyes flicker sideways in an inhuman way? Wonderful! However, even in this film, to calm the Seagals that enjoy the latest elegance and no one can kick them at all, the happiness is somewhat stronger. However, all ordinary humans are crushed around it. Come on, I can understand the bully or the walker in the Big Mouth neighborhood, but these are people with superhuman power. Oh, and get this, Segal goes through a short series of identity issues, because he and his colleagues in the film seem to think that Wolverine! O GO GO ... Worse of all! Yes, there is worse. It has more sound than changing the sound in the middle of the sentence while looking at the face. They obviously do not look like him and I think he might be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I've wanted to turn it off, I'm always watching a movie so it ends up being down at all times even for your direct Stephen videos. Sei! Sei! Sei! Thumb down! The qualities of redemption? Well, I think so, I'll be fair in this aspect. At least some special effects were fine and I loved choosing wardrobe for actors and actresses. All IMO women were very attractive. Still, I said STILL, does not make up X-Men, Underworld scandalous, (Enter your favorite zombie movie, vampire here)! The director, writer, producer, must be denied and denied film work. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and about all other Uwe Boll photos) about this movie. This is my $ 1.00 in this movie. View if you dare.
