The cover of this film is named Kyle Minogue, but has the same amount as Drew Barrymore in Scream. This is the first thing that makes this movie lame. They are trying to market a movie with someone in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to show this film to the young children of the hip collectors who are oblivious to the presence of a murderer around him. Most importantly, Molly Ringwald of the 80's is a teen star and is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good professional step for Molly to get some money for a crappy movie in Australia so it is not ridiculed in the United States. <br /> <br /> In either case, this stupid film is about some stupid horror film that was never finished because this stupid creature kills everyone in it. During the film, we are supposed to guess who the killer is. Long story short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... Or is it? <br /> <br /> This step is very bad, hire it if you want to torture yourself or break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread horror.
