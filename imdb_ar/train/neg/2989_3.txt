Although the probability of someone focusing on this comment among more than 80 years for this low film, I feel I should say something about this one. I'm not a film watcher who cares about the value of production, thoughtful dialogue, great acting and direction. However, I pretend that this film sucks. I do not know why I do not like ... I mean it contains almost everything I want from a horror film: blood, obscene, unintentional humor, etc. According to this guide, this should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things that make you scream on the screen. Such as when the girl leaves the army man when their car collapses to find water (this spoils nothing, do not worry). Enter into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not you see that there is a friggin lake in the middle of the building ??? Yes she is looking for water and pass a lake. why? She wants to know why people (who are not abandoned) are not going to answer them when she calls out, "Is there anyone?" Oh, this is just a little little thing I can remember from the big picture I draw. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, though, why this movie was given more than one star. It's one of those movies that if you forget how bad it is, as I have several times, you want to see it again because it is too much on each side. Call it blood in the first paragraph, but this film has no blood, has the circumference of Gore. Also, its very strange creatures in it: a baby coma (with a big size ???) and a flying head magically to name a few. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you're trying to think about the worst and most famous films ever produced and come out with the 50 science fiction movies? I think that Zombi 3 and movies like that should top those. It contains all the elements: scientists who argue with the government, warnings from the end of the world on the radio, armies that fight monsters, and so on. This is plan 9 of '80'! Although I will not say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the worst. And when you discover that predicting the worst is to underestimate Zombi 3, that will not be bad. You might like this in fact, I'm not saying that this is impossible. <br /> <br /> I do not think I hate this movie, I do not ... really. Oh, r. Kill the Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (Did you just blow my credibility?)
