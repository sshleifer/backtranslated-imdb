Take a SciFi Original movie and get a mix of alternative history / review, and you'll get "Aztec Rex". It seems that Hernan Curtis, before the invasion of the Aztec empire, had to first overcome the Rex dinosaur and her colleague. This is the essence of this film. Given the plot that he could really suck; the fact that the only kind of sucked is the tip of the cover for the book. There are a few problems. For starters, Curtis played by Ian Zirring. Even with a black wig, the Ziering as Cortes is about to convince like Axl Rose to play Gandhi. Although Cortes invades indigenous peoples in Mexico, the Aztecs appear here to be played by the whole Hawaiian band. Put aside, the T-Rex (es) looks reasonably good, although every time you shoot one of them, you beat the CGI. They die very easily. I suppose that if T-Rex exists in real life, it is likely to have been dropped or wounded at least by somewhat rudimentary weapons in the sixteenth century. But it takes nothing away from the film. There are also some scenes of human T-Rex, which is surprising, but in this context I thought it works well. There are a lot of procedures, and the entire colonial angle is everywhere but it does not overwhelm the corner of dinosaurs, unlike the other SciFi Original Dinosaur movie "Warbirds". In general, an average movie (but decent according to SciFi Original standards) classifies a modest 4.
