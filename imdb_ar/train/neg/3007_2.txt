Well, in search of the endless horror, we will come across this movie, which seems to have been reissued on a recent DVD for an unholy reason. The transportation is awful and the quality just sucks. I do not think the reason for this is a bad bad copy or anything, I just think that the movie was not bad. <br /> <br /> It is clear that he was filmed in a deserted school with a budget that is no doubt lost on cheap beer and there is no talent for breakthroughs. Slaughter High begins slowly and does not improve until about an hour. First, we see a "nerd" where he is chosen by a group of ... I actually do not even know what he was supposed to be ... The CD players? The group leader, with his extremely ugly super hook was Sure, he was supposed to have been chosen as a nerd.Therefore, there is a "big man" and two losers and dumb chicks who are supposed to be "hot" but are not ... It is a mystery that this group of rejection picks up one On its own, but I think the viewer is assuming that these "wonderful kids" are picking on the dweeb As most other reviewers have pointed out here, actors (if you can call them) are a group of Britons whose dialects explode several times throughout this collection of waste. The group of "children" are the only students in this school, because "reunited" are only in school, which now appears abandoned, they are only. <br /> <br /> Killing Lame, Gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo With real people. Lines like: "This place gives me creeps ..." and "someone interested in beer" are the highlights ... it's not good. Skip this one unless you get lost with some friends and I want to laugh to try a real lame slasher. If you want to see well, you should get "Bay Of Blood" from Bava 14 years ago and much better. If you want to see a BAD well, see "Before the Dawn" or "The Burning." 2 out of 10, Children.
