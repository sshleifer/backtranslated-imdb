I'm at a disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two films in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen movies. Series fans seem to think this is a good film. Judging by it alone, it was very boring. <br /> <br /> You will never get a real good look at the face of the obsessed cop (Robert Zadar), but what I saw was very bleak. The scenes of death seem to be organized to eat most of the films, not to give any excitement. Maybe if I see NC-17 Director's Cut, I might be more dazzling. <br /> <br /> The chase with the Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davy was very intense. The best part of the film.
