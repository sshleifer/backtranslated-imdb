I have completely forgotten about this film so far. This was the most obvious and worst attempt to sabotage a hobby I had ever seen. The message seems to be: "Teenagers do not use their imagination; they may take the games seriously, cheating and harming people." I can only guess that the non-fiction writers of this piece thought that D & D style games are a form of evil ritual or a mysterious cult.
