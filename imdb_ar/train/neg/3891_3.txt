I think my favorite part of this film, which represents a meaningless example, stupidity and vanity of actions, comes at the height of the film. Ted Nelson and his unmarried friend, Sharif, trapped the fusion man when landing on some of the stairs in a power plant. Keep in mind that Nelson was looking for MM for almost the whole movie, and that MM had killed and eaten many people at this stage (including his boss), and Nelson fully realized that MM was crazy and violent about human flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So Sheriff has fired his cannon at the MM, which is, and gave the film and Rick Baker's props for this purpose, the most disgusting and terrifying thing in a human form we did not see I saw. He yells a very important question to Ted Nelson: "What do we do now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera goes to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and Ted obviously has no idea what to do next. It is clear that Ted was determined to find the fusion man, and never thought of bringing some restrictive devices, lasso, strait, network or some soothing arrows or perhaps a new band of Vangelis to calm the monster beast. <br /> <br /> So the panic shoots, the fading man fades, and then follows the joy. <br /> <br /> This may explain why NASA has been orbiting the Space Shuttle program in space without the moon over the last 30 years, rather than going back to the moon or going to Mars, where everyone knows they should be. I do not know that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a kind of lousy writing, sluggish slowness and a trend that reduces every aspect of this film. It's hard to say how good the actors really are, because the film has total disdain for their characters. <br /> <br /> There are two other incredibly dramatic sequences that increase the stupidity of action: there is a scene with the most beautiful films. The old couple in the world are trying to steal lemon from an orchard, only to be torn by a melting man. This scene is rare in the cinema of the seventies. I can assure you that you have never seen a calmer and more angry setting with more extraordinary people in your entire life. The "melting of the man" attack on the woman who lives in the house where they are holding a horse peeing on the walls defies any attempt to deal with it. (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathan Demi has a picnic in this scene as a backward husband who goes first to check out the house and never comes out again). The only thing that prevents the actress from literally chewing the scene is that, as I said, it seems that their horse is peeing on it. We are forced to watch her hysteria for at least two minutes more than any film director from SANE holds the shot. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning must overcome the idiocy of the IMM director and photographer. I remember it from an old Colombo episode where it looked much better than it was here - no idea for anyone about a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one can be unattractive in real life like his manager makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is a bit better except for the old couple (and they are silent, I know they were laughing, but I'm not laughing!) But not much. <br /> <br /> This definitely falls into the category of "Too Bad You Can not Find Away" for movie disasters. However, I would have seen her again before I watched a lot of abortions that took place in the 1970s and 1980s (the "Track of the Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night"), and her MST coverage is very fun, so if you get a chance, See the MST version.
