After reading some good comments about this film, I thought it was time to go and see it. Well, I do not know why I was bothered. Essentially, this family is entrusted with an idea that leads to a large collection of ancient treasures, hidden by the Knights of the Temple during the War of Independence. It was clear that it had to be removed from British hands at all costs. First, why did the cavalry transfer the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages show that Charlotte was actually a ship? How do they discover all the clues and puzzles in about one minute? How can two people suddenly become the main thieves and steal what is perhaps the best guarding paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this little Hollywood act of error. Cage was in some great motion movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - so why did he do that? Is he old? His character is really annoying - somehow, this "normal" man steals the Declaration of Independence, trumps thieves with guns, flees the FBI, and seems generally invincible. The whole movie did not really make sense, and overall it was a big disappointment.
