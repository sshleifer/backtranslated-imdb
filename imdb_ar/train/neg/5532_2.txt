The zombie revolution is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's too far on the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of making zombies after World War I, one member decided to use knowledge for his evil ambitions. It has succeeded, at least initially. The love triangle complicates the story. <br /> <br /> This was a really hard film, with a terrible representation making it hard to tell who the zombies were and who they were not. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was incredible (not the zombie part of it but the "romantic" parts). Although I am not any student or cinematographer, the work of the camera does not help the film too much. <br /> <br /> While I've seen some of the worst movies, it's unlikely to satisfy anyone. It's bad, not very well.
