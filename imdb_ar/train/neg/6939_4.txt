R Balki tries to tell you a story narrated by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishbad in a sensitive way. This time mixed with mature humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job. According to him, cooking art. I still can not make Hyderabad Bryani properly. <br /> <br /> Enter the tibo that Hyderabad sends to Bryani, which she has created herself and starts meeting soon and finally meet each other ?? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35. No problems! But one hurdle! The father of Tabo Barish Rawal !! Couples decide to meet the father to approve their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much smaller. Complications begin ?? Wise performance All three actors are brilliant. The screenplay is very narrow and interesting. Attractive film dialogues. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not filled properly. Comedy sometimes is not properly understood. The film also tries to be long in some parts. <br /> <br /> There is nothing musical except the title path. The work of the camera is good. R Balki's output may be much better than this scenario. But in the second half he seems confused. The scene of "Satyagrah" seemed disturbing to the father. But the lines Amitabh Bachchan talked about in this scene deserve applause. <br /> <br /> On the whole, Cheney's tea needed more sugar!
