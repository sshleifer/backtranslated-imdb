This offer is terrible, jokes are all awful and getting worse. I'm one of those people who never liked Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at the beginning until it came to an end around the second season, and all the jokes were played out and the characters had nothing to do with them. Well, the gas corner was at least good at first, the little mosque in the turf is a very bad comedy for CBC that did not have anything from episode 1. Who are the people watching this show anyway, I honestly do it top Age or maybe just people actually living on lawns? Maybe jokes for them while they work there? I do not know one person likes this offer and I can not afford it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the less sophisticated people from Corner Gas. I hope that this will not last longer because all the success of this exhibition was entirely based on the premise of this Muslim who is different and who could / should have led to a wonderful show.
