This film was set to be a wonderful film, and it really is. This is the type of film that is set up to eat popcorn until you see brilliant graphics. With that in mind, the film delivers, perhaps not so irony, but it is good enough. Outside of the chewing popcorn frame and special effects, the film starts off the slope faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including myself, will complain about the extent to which most characters have changed heavily, but this only makes the film a weak adaptation, not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. Concentrators focused on making them more attractive to the eye than their focus on the mind. The long-awaited characters are reduced and promoted to 4 veil scenes. The main characters in Wolverine, Victor Creed (not named Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker were well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the characters are tossed on the side of the road to make room for each important eye candy. The Wolverine character was fully developed after 30 minutes, as did Sabertooth, although Victor takes some late surprises from the film. <br /> <br /> The "Final Director" of the film is a quirky adaptation to the original character's brawlers and hardly gets any development to show why it is what it is. It is clear that filmmakers felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad, hurtful character who could do anything they wanted and slap in the name of a popular figure. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
