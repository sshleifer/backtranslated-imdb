My friend was in the acting team as a FEDS agent (part does not speak, as I remember). I brought it to a DVD so I could see it. It was "fun," but he felt a lot of amateur film. Amateur film is well-made, though. Really boring and bad writing. It may have been fun to participate and participate, but it certainly does not deserve any kind of broad release. Maybe in Omaha they enjoyed it, but this girl in California was bored and frankly embarrassed to get involved with my friend. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker has made or made any other films, he should actually try our really interesting story line and good actors. I'm sure this was a great educational tool for them. I wish them success in the future, I hope they can improve their film industry.
