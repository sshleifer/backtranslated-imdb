I'm just wondering why Michael is making such a film in Turkey ... Michael is a great actor especially in the film where he plays a man who dies from cancer .. That was great. He checks himself for his son to see her once he grows up .. Michael is a talented actor .. What made him do this ??? I saw it and thought it was really stupid .. I think that sometime in their careers they have crappy films .. especially the "Squeeze" I did not understand this at all, and I feel that his best performance was in the Pacific Heights, I really enjoyed "pluralism." This was very hilarious and was perfectly perfect for Batman's role .. I like a bit of "Night Shift" and I love "John Dangerously" too .. very bad, some of them ended up with bad movies. This was like ...
