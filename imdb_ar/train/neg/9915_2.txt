I just finished a "dark room" and also known as "under observation" and I was surprised. I was astounded, not through the film, but through some rave reviews I had been touched by the impact I had seen. The story has been ruined by drawing holes, and the majority of the actions seem to be too flat, classified as an appropriate comedy. Seriously, I found myself shivering from my head and laughing in confusion as I carried this film. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the limits of living at home with a mother addicted to the pain of being subjected to living with his policeman father despite my mother's warnings from Dad not being good. When a young woman is found dead, Justin becomes skeptical of the tenants who reside in the neighboring apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, he installs secret cameras to keep the tabs on these people. When the truth begins to collapse, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> A positive point is that Felissa Rose is hot! I would have happily jotted off a star or two extra stars here if she had been a little peeled, but you were not lucky. It would have been a blessing saving the film. I thought Eric Conley had played Justin with great skill, and I would not be surprised to see more of him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, despite its clich√©, may have been successful if the ridiculously hollow "performances" were not made by the main crew members, notably Alexandra Eitel and David H. Reg (Justin's father). the horror! (Pardon the pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. In fact, I think independent film is our only hope in making decent films in the coming days. I will reduce the number of low-cost movies when it comes to special effects, lighting, music scores and overall image quality. I do not give allowances, however, to represent the stick character and scenario for Swiss cheese lovers. There are a large number of low-budget films efficiently. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can only doubt that a few reviewers who hailed the "dark room" here somehow belong to its production.
