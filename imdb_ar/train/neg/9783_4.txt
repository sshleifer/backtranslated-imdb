Not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly not too good. I myself am a paintball player, I used to play volleyball a lot and move from forest to volleyball is a big change. The film depicts a similar quality. First of all, the film begins with this group, which apparently tries to portray this "ghost" or anything else, who seems to be a professional team wearing T-shirts and shooting at glasses and motorists. One man is a heavy athlete. There was no big mistake in the film, but the most I felt was that it was very cheesy. A handful of children who are good men are wooden players who do not seem to have much money and have dreams of getting "better weapons". Another team picks them up and humiliates them because they play woods and blah blah. Ghost helps these children in football and trains them all nonsense, it makes them play volleyball and defeats all the teams mainly including "professionals." <br /> <br /> So what exactly is wrong with the film? Well, the budget is huge, Paintball will not be bad but the budget is very low and the film seems to have been made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the representation is very cheesy. Imagine paintballs too bad. They seem to point out that everyone will go to the ball of speed and all that nonsense. It was just a bad film in my opinion and does not give a real idea of ​​what colors are. To be honest in the real paintball, not all gay friends, it is a lot of applause and rewards, not "respect" and play according to the rules. Do not watch this movie, then expect to go to a screaming field "4 is 1 !!"
