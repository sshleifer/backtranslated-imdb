Wonderful. I read about this film and it looked so terrible that I had to watch it, my God, I can smell it in St. Louis. where do I start? National Lampoons were trying to follow up 5 years after Animal House's success, but they were completely wrong. I will go chronologically with these short clicks. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> The poor Peter Riggert (Bonn of Animal House). Apparently, he was not working at the time, so maybe the boys called the National Lampoons and said, "Hey, we're making a c ** ppy movie, would you like to be there?" Peter was like "Well, I do not do so much these days, why not?" He was a great side figure at Animal House, but could not afford this unfortunate short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is funny enough, as Jason Cooper (Riegert) told his wife to leave, you need to find herself. It is very strange that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he chased her, there, and Cooper was responsible for the children. This, of course, leads him to burn the house, the loss of many children, sleep with a variety of New York Pembus (including young Dian Lin ever). Then the wife returns and wants the children and the film ends with a metal coin that will decide the fate of the children. The idea was actually pretty smart, but the director was a genius. All the characters seem to fall asleep, they must be anesthetized. Sorry, your legacy has been distorted by this flipping. <br /> <br /> Movie # 2 <br /> <br /> More spoilers <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsair. A beautiful girl, I finished college recently, not sure what to do with her life. So you become slut, and begin to sleep with some rich of the rich, take their money when they die, and do not stop until giving birth to the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (excuse me, I mean President of the United States of America). Again, it could have been funny, and although I was happy because Coursayer (Ann Dusenbere in real life) was not afraid of everything, her behavior was terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I made this far away. Here's the rookie Brent Falcon (Robbie Benson) with veteran Stan Nagorsky (Richard Widmark). The Falcon is a young, na√Øve person who thinks he can really help people, even though he was ridiculed after being shot several thousand times. Nagurski, really, has given up care. It sees and integrates mergers, attacks, and never intervenes. He considers that the world is not governed by law, and that he is likely to be paid if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of a taxi race) starts work, calls the police, commits a crime, but uses his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been funny, and the campers were intentionally, but good, not energy shows at all. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi must be ashamed of their names on this impasse. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the implementation was executed in addition to the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If you're part of this movie, I'd like to remove it, it's terrible. Then again, that's why I saw it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this trash is that Dr. John got the degree of the film (repeat "go to the movies" over and over again) and the film is not so much longer than an hour and a half. "What you should never do in filmmaking." This text should have been left on the shelf because that's bad.
