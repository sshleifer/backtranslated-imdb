A friend of mine gave me a saying that he was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas". Not nearby. I think my main complaint is the most attractive leading actress in the porn industry at all. The most terrible thing is that they appear on the screen almost all the time. But I read somewhere in those days, it was pornographic to have some "technical" value. I could not find it though. You can only watch it if you are interested in the history of the development of pornography to the mainstream, or you can appreciate art in pornographic films. I know I am not. But the film director seems talented. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they refused.
