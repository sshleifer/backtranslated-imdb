Oh I hired her, so they shot me! <br /> <br /> There is a good hypothesis that sets up an embarrassing story otherwise without any real return, but at least it is well shot. Director John Keyes takes a simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with a real danger at home. In most cases, it should be a dunk, but this little stink gets off the track very quickly. Cinematography is above average and the average representation at best, but the story and writing are just awful. The slowest scenes continue forever, and the fears are very few and far apart with no real climax of the film. Strange mood is set in the beginning but it loses its luster before any kind of horror, and I find myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The art of the cover is attractive and I think it is worth leasing if you are looking to get rid of the reckless low budget but if you enjoy a good story And an eventful ending, look for something else.
