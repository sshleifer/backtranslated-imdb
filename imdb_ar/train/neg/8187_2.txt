I went to this movie expecting it to be great. That was. I was really sorry that star actress Cathy Bates was a great actress ... Before making this film - Vince Vaughn and Paul Jiamati were as disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson could not put in one of the great shows I know and love for. Farid Farid, played by Trevor Peacock (of the famous Vickary of Dublin, among others), had almost one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor ... was absent. (However, there was one part of the film where Santa entered the home of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh only because their expressions were classic) Do not watch this movie unless the only other alternative you have is face-to-face collision with a train (actually, maybe The train would be better ...)
