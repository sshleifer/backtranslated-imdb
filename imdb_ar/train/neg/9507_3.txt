I always feel frustrated by films that were clearly written by one sex. Especially when they do not do enough research to discover the fact that something is not only true but also blatantly false. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the scene in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that he got Diane pregnant. No one will ever cheer in any form or form or other man carrying a pregnant girl in high school. They may chant about the guy who fucked the warm cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team he heard will not be in a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was clear that this film did not "do not take itself seriously, it was not so bad, but come on!
