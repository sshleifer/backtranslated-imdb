As many others have mentioned, this is a terrible film, from every aspect of filmmaking. How they have ever received reputed representatives for their participation in this project is amazing. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that he had been filmed on "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was filmed on video, but not "cheap" video. What made it bad was the lighting, white balance, and imaging and editing technology. <br /> <br /> There were many different imaging and editing techniques used and that were chaotic in production. Harsh, inconsistent lighting, excessive use of hand fire (Ala and Woody Allen), and intermittent editing (another Allen style), but poorly done, without any real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen is embarrassing. Very amateurish. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex viewer had no value to represent at any level. <br /> <br /> How to make this video print out of me. It is worth watching if you are only surprised at how damaging it is.
