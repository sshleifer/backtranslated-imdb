A scant science fiction novel with almost complete incompetence (the control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from outer space is powered by ONE MAN only and is very poorly guarded at night) and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only lost, but also offers one of his few shows, "I'm here for money only." (* 1/2)
