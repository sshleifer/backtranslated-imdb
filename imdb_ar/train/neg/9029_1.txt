This film almost misses the talents of every actor in the best of what can be called a wonderful "botweller". <br /> <br /> Although it is a "goofy" full of movement, everything that comes down from there with lots of stereotypes and potential stances follow each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of storytelling stories in this film I guessed at some point made through the compilation of a neglected television series. <br /> <br /> The role of Queen of Mexican drugs is ironic and his "partners" removed from the Queen-Martin cop program in 1970. Costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he fell in love with Mendez's wife. Nor have we convincingly believed that the wife is suffering for companionship and will jump on the first hot body that comes. <br /> <br /> Certainly the movie "B" at best is a huge waste of time for all involved.
