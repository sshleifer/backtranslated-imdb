The most hated film women of all time? Not to mention that by 68 they should not have passed the white people in the brown face playing "Indians"? However, my favorite parts should be when girls laugh and bathe as cyclists drag them to rape them. Rape is fun! Who knows? Let's see, then, there are glaring cracks of "The Hustler" (the character of the head of obesity actually playing a gathering while planning to destroy the Indians with the leading rebellious dude), terrible acting, etc., likely to be aware of the ideas of music, There is no Indian person already in this movie. And who is supposed to be ushered in? I must say that it is clear that Quentin Tarantino likes this film. Although his films tend to support powerful women, I have heard from at least one source that, in fact, he is stupid and hateful to women. Why did you see him, ask? do not ask.
