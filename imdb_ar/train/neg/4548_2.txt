boring. The plot is minimal. No personal development. I went to this movie with great expectations of the book. It may be a wonderful movie. It may become a classic cult. No, he was a giant. It was a bad cast and had terrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels, the military, the church or all of them? I'm still puzzled by some of the mini plots of film. I have been left stunned by certain aspects of this alleged "prophecy", which have never been fully explained. I felt like I was watching a loop full of mini-series on the Sci-Fi channel. It looked like a TV movie. Do not go to see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
