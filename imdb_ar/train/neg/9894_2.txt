I missed the beginning of this film, which may explain why I did not like much. On the other hand, I studied the fall of the Roman Republic for years until I knew the story. Then again, this may be why I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie contains more historic errors than additions. Although they are so inaccurate that I do not think they made an attempt to be correct, in this case they can be forgiven. The strange thing is that sometimes they go so far as to be accurate historical that it ends up confusing. Such as the throwing of Anthony's marriage in Octavia, and then pushed him aside after two scenes. Why even put it up if it serves no purpose of the plot and Octavia so unprecedented? Like Antonius' call in his actual name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and through his strange English name Mark Anthony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Although historical inaccuracies aside, the film could have been an amusing hour if not for the lead lady. There is no ounce of dignity in her. It's hysterical, dramatic, and completely lacking to control itself. Instead Cleopatra is a clever and authoritative queen who transforms into a hysterical teenager suffering from a bad state of menstruation. 95% of that comes from bad representation, but 5% is also poor script writing. Much of the stupid drama is written in the script. Sometimes you do not see Antonius and Cleopatra, you are watching immature versions of Dawson and Joy from Dawson Creek. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something about this period, watch ... anything but this.
