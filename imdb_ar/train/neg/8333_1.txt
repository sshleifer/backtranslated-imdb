This is by far the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life. The representation is lousy and the story is almost understandable. Whether you like or do not like light ships or any ships for that matter it is irrelevant. As for special effects, the film contains nothing. Perhaps the whole crew was on the boat in the harsh seas instead of the studio, and when some men were "stabbed" (if you could even name it) their reactions were unrealistic at all. The guns are quieter than mute. How can this film get two awards, putting serious questions on the state of the human mind. Well that's about it. This review is probably more fun than reading the movie. If anyone is thinking of watching or buying it, I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I said it included spoiler. If the fact that some people have been stabbed and fired gun fire is a conspiracy gift. I suppose the reason is that they are the only good parts of the film.
