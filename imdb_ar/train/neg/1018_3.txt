There is an excellent reason to direct Edison directly to the video: he would land in the theaters with a rickety jingle. The film continued for a very long time and was very boring. Just a higher degree than lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had spare parts two weeks before their next film), the bad guys are laughing and working near nonexistent like Justin Timberlake's representation. I hate hitting a guy, but the more I realize that pop music is his share, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad ... mostly. I love the fact that LL Cool J was given what seems to be a shot of a leading man. he deserves it. Unlike his fellow musicians and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is also always fun (you can see him play several times as he chews the scenery), and Freeman has the ability to raise this to three stars (out of ten ... it's not good). <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done, the absolute error in this film is that it is a mundane and cumbersome piece of fake weight for fake games that fail to keep anyone awake. It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters. All in all, t just boring. That being said, hire this when you are suffering from insomnia.
