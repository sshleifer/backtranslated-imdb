"Paula, I may be a whore, but I will never be!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in a otherwise boring flick which features beautiful honey in Stacey Walker, but that's it. This deadly real tease lures her friends and co-workers and even her classmate in the gay room Paola in her bedroom, but then turns into a troubled job crying "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic character of this authoritative is interesting for a short time, but this story eventually turns into a real recurring love affair. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who will still care by then.
