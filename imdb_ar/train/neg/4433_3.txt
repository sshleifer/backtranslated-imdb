I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love the idiotic foreign comedy - especially the weird ones that totally surprised you. However, although this surprise surprised me a lot, it was never pleasant surprises. It reminded me in South Park that almost all social norms had been violated until the only people who left to get the disease became very funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of almost every kind - from pot, heroin, speed to inhaling glue), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. Sexual abuse of children. My mother encouraged her only son (who was about 12 years old) to sleep with the men nearby. In fact, at some point in the film, this boy is offering a dentist instead of paying for Sunni work! Funny?! You must be kidding. This film goes too far and turns into a "black hole of comedy". What should be harnessed from the next cancer or rectal tumors?
