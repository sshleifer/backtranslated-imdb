This film is a fatal failure. I'm a lover of Steve Martin, but even he can not save the tired idea and the text of Swiss cheese. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do not feel that other user comments reflect the poor evaluation of this film (which it really deserves!). It is very misleading. I've seen this movie often up to $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now I know for sure why. <br /> <br /> If you can only restore 90 minutes ...
