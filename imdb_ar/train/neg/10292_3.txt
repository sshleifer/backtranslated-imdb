Its an advantage. Morphorn Calar is both a privilege and a disappointment. It's very mysterious, very original. Is it the way it treats the pain of loss that makes it too far and can not be linked? Or is it as one of the reviewers described it as revolutionary? Personally, I call it flawed. <br /> <br /> Morphran separates herself perfectly. Getting rid of her boyfriend, not thinking about informing the family or using the money he gave her to attend an appropriate funeral, she candidly ran on a trip to Spain. It seems completely devoid of anything relatively human. The only element that the public can see from the human side is her close friend who takes her on vacation with her. Although her boyfriend has been thrown out in the end, Morphorn has nothing to do with humanity. She may have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Although it managed to make Spain look as bleak and nice as the director's shots were, the lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> It is truly shameful that the film does not contain anything that keeps the attention. Just over 90 minutes but feel longer. They've made Morvern look interesting to catch your attention, but they do nothing but isolate you from you so much that you do not care about character or film.
