The blows of this film - Let's get to the point now. There are a few gems that fall within this heap of crap but no one can recapture the lame plot. Colin Farrell looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts similarly. I usually hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he is fine in this film. There were two plot lines in this film - one about a child throwing stones at the windshield of moving vehicles and the other about a woman carrying a shawl. Let's face it - this film has no scary idea of ​​what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. The lines of the characters' story intersect at some levels but are in no way worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and useless, and then there is a good scene. But overall - do not bother unless you love the Irish dialects so much that you can watch the poorness being saved by everyone who looks like a dwarf Lucky Charms - an American fetish that has led to the success of some crappy movies already.
