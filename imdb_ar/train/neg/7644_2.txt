It has been a long time since the last time I saw a very bad film .. The representation is very average, the story is terribly boring, and I am puzzled by the words regarding the death. It was not entirely original. Oh, this is a comedy like Clint Eastwood Schwarzenegger Stand! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the viewer with the TV show - Where the hell are you?) I got right - the actors were 80% of let's face it - the forgotten actors. If they hope to get a job back, I think this may not happen with their resume! The script had the potential, but 80 per cent of the actors and the director (who was a representative and should be committed to being clearly represented) did not withdraw. Fred Dorset was the only person who looked better than any of the rest. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever thought about watching this - I strongly recommend it to turn into something less shocking, because it is not only a total loss of time, but also a poor example of bad cinema.
