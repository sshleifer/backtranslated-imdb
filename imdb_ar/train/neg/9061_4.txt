What can you say about this film? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days ago I saw Lillies and it was one of the best gay films I've ever seen. So this was not the best time to watch a mediocre homosexual flick. <br /> <br /> The story was silly and the acting was good. It was not bad enough to turn it off, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. It was not good either. <br /> <br /> Is this movie recommended? You will not waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made and financed. Spend your time watching Noah on the logo instead. I think this is where I was trying this movie to go but did not get there.
