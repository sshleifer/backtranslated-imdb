John Pertoy was the one who said "It's very hard to be funny but it's very easy to be silly." Well if this is the case with the object PASTY is "very easy". David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his actors appear to be under the impression that comedy involves the theft of scenes and style from top Britons such as LOCK STOCK. Voice is very loud. Alan McCaffrey has a particular kind of OTT performance but not enough to destroy the film because there is not enough film to destroy it. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially text. I could not understand why it ended as I did, it seemed to stop in a very sudden and ridiculous way. Oh and other blatant mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work there - this film makes you think you can get off the plane and start a new life in America without any statement - that you are still paying me to donate blood in America - Who I know in America, who donate blood, told me to pay for donations that stopped several years ago - and you can buy any kind of weapons from an arms store. As far as I know, weapons laws in America vary from state to state, but there are no shops selling weapons that sell anti-tank weapons. So, we've got a misreading of America from a film that is very unreal and unreasonable. Maybe this is the revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots? Maybe, but this does not prevent PASTY FACES from being a nonsense comedy
