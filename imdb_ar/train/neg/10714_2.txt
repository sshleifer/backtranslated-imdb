For two of the most comedians, the film was awful. Redirected quickly and never improved! Waste of time and wasted for money! Tina Fei is a wonderful writer, I thought she would be wonderful in comedy. The previews were very large, but they showed only the best parts of the film. My husband thought that for a flick of the chick, it sucked. What's up with that. The film was very slow. I would not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like to restore my money to this one! Bo from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be very funny. I gave birth to my children and helped others to have children. It could have been more style-like.
