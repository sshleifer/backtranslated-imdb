I'm one of the millions who consider themselves fans of Cary Grant, but I can not think of one reason to recommend this film. I do not understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it seems that no one did, if we wanted to judge the small number of films that I played then. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at chasing and earning Cary Grant in "Child Raising." Here the director or book tries to rephrase the idea, but it fails miserably.I have read comments about how "Drake" But I thought it was a very mild description, and Franchot Tone watched this as if he were hungry ... The disaster is one disaster. <br /> <br /> This video does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know why this Unfortunately, this movie has been preserved when many of the films that are worth rotting are in safes. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give this Z widely.
