Now, I bounced back on this curiosity and had to keep watching - the same way you see a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a parody, but that should not stop me from criticizing God's terrible guidance , Representation and dialogue. Seriously, this movie was rated as one of the poorest films I've ever seen - it looked like a Cryptkeeper episode, and a poor episode in it. <br /> <br /> Well - some criticisms (1) When a doctor has a heart attack The army then fired shells, rockets and bullets at the monster - which was a few feet away from the doctor - however, the doctor did not touch any missile and was still alive (2) Attack The army of about 100 yards, we see the flame launcher uses - Geez, these objects no more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run to the classroom and shoot the ceiling; the monster drops the boy, the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) Monster looks like something from Power Rangers! (5) There is one scene where the five "Righteous" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and child) all get shocked and get reactions (like the hand of the mouth) one by one - very normal! (6) The general runs away, time after time (7) The general refuses to experience electricity and will not listen (8) Representation is terrible (9) Have you mentioned the monster of the rubber suit ???? (10) that God's music is awful, non-stop!
