Well, during the previous Thanksgiving break, while everyone in the family together decided to go to a movie, and since a unique item was chosen by majority, that's what we said and said. <br /> <br /> To start the movie, there were lots of plot holes that were pathetic. Simple explanations of the cause of an event were false. Example: Who the heck is trying to "close" Santa's sentence? Is it a kind of company? There will be a little beautiful interpretation. <br /> <br /> Second: The film gave you flimsy characters that do not raise any sympathy for your feelings or actions. Example: A small dwarf named Willie and the only girl in the village of dwarf. They see each other twice and then they are a couple and I could care less because this film did not make me care. <br /> <br /> Third: I think this was supposed to be a family film? It was rated low in PG only. For the family film there were many articles of suggestive conversation. It did not bother me, but if you were a parent, I saw a problem. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti, through the entire film, was very bored by his role, but frankly he was the only one to be seen in the film. Vaughn encountered funny moments but played the same character he played in the last two films. Boy Freak Mouth. (Nothing against Vaughn, I've been good at other movies) <br /> <br /> So this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to make an effort to produce, publish and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will definitely order this click, or if you should see it, you can save it to rent a rainy day.
