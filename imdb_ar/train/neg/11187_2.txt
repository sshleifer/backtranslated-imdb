The deadly erroneous orders - along with the Asian conspiracy - are that the personality simply does not resonate or even react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest, walking through a late-night graveyard, is subjected to a sudden attack by morale spirits. After fighting, he quietly resumes walking when his friend comes. "Anything wrong?" His friend asks, after he saw the attack. "Only some demonic spirits - nothing I could not handle." No reaction, no surprise, just like a non-frame. His colleague is not interested in both ... must be trained as a standard priest ... ["Then put the wafer in their mouths ... Do you have any questions? Well, go ahead, demon demon attacks ..."] <br /> < The second example: At some point, the priests need to answer a question, and can only provide a demon (or something, which he cares about now). What? Why, you have to ask a man die! So Satan has a random person hanging in front of the priests so they can ask their question to the man who is floundering in flames. "Hey, do not kill him!" Or maybe "This is not nice!" It would be more realistic then their response. They never ask the man to leave or stop in fact, and the closest to the reaction is mild discomfort. They ask their question and they go. <br /> <br /> I had to close it at that point - my mind was beginning to go astray. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
