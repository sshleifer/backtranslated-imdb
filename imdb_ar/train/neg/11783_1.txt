What a crappy movie! The worst! This movie is amusing like a deadly alloy. There is no talent, more than ever, a stupid conspiracy. Who wrote this text ?! Was there any scenario for this stupid film or did the director just accidentally click the registration button on his camera and then decide to make the film while he was coming? Does this mean a children's movie or comedy or what? My younger friends are in grade 6. He and his colleagues have just made an amateur film for their school project that went beyond this eccentric genius film. This is the worst film I have ever seen! There is no excuse for this flick!
