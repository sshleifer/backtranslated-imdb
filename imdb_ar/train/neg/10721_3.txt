An expedition led by Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to see what happened to a previous trip. They meet pretty mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodan) who joins them. Soon they find themselves facing a mummy drinking blood ... It seems that only Samira is knowing what is going on. <br /> <br /> A real swamp. I caught this late at night when I was ten years old. Put me to sleep! Seeing it again all these years later I can see why. It is slow to move, and the mummy does not show up to 40 minutes (only 66 minutes!). The representation ranges from bad to bad REAL (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to be found. This film focuses more on second-rate dramas (including a silly love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> This three stars is rated because it looks really good, everyone plays it directly, there is a good representation of Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) are not bad. They're not scary just creepy mildly. Still, this movie is very bad. Sure fire cure for insomnia.
