In a way, they summed up the 1960s, a decade that radically changed our country, within four hours. What four painful hours was. They ridiculed major events and "claimed" that it was about the two families, but you hardly saw the African-American family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed to have such a waste. What was fun was that this happy family I saw at first was tortured in several ways, but you were able to attend an event every 60 years across the country. The second family was such a factor. They probably devoted five or six macro scenes to this family. This poor son ... please NBC, do not make any movies for any other ages .... Leave it to PBS and History Channel
