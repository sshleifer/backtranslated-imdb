Why does this do me too? <br /> <br /> I do not expect Dean Ken to make successful films. Or even decent movies. I saw Lewis and Clark, and I'm familiar with how ... "Good" Ken Dean is. <br /> <br /> Obviously this will become a cheese flick, and each cheese flake has its own way of making you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers because you can not spoil this film more than it already exists. <br /> <br /> To begin ... why this fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How does this world come from Chicago and that this is the other world of Los Angeles and no one can be more than Eastern Europe if they try? How hard was it to get an American actor, or just to change the film's clich√© to say that these people are not Americans? <br /> <br /> Why are there two occasions when the film gives us an alloy line? We get a helipad a day and then fall into chaos later. Then that's it, who cares about the schedule. To be honest, who cared about him even when they mentioned him, but I think this is next to the subject. <br /> <br /> Does the movie really improve if you are able to watch it through multiple screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon is sure to walk in that room ... and more ... and more ... and more ... ... <br /> <br /> From the face of the earth was responsible for one Of the worst endings in the history of the film? It was directly from Scooby Doo. Oh, death of the dragon now ... Say, do you want to get dinner? Sure, but not somewhere Chinese .... with the dragon in the name !! Ah ha ha ha! Ha ha ha !! Ha ha ha! I used to be Superman! Aha ha ha! HA HA! <br /> <br /> Fading to black <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, it made me so fun and so stupid. <br /> <br /> But I have never been afraid ... The building has exploded completely ... and no one is alive ... For some reason, there is a second laboratory that no one has touched so well that they can make a supplement. Hey, all of us. <br /> <br />
