First things first: I'm not conservative. Although I will never refer to myself as liberal or democratic, I have opposed the war in Iraq since the first day. I think it's safe to say John Cusack, and maybe I see face to face in politics, in fact, I'm sure we'll be drinking buddies if we get to talking about the extent of the great Adam Curtis documents in the BBC. My point is: Do not discredit this review by thinking that I'm not part of the choir that Kozak is defending at War, Inc. WI's policy is certainly designed to fit a demographic, but the problem is that sewing is substandard, He co-wrote Cusack, produced and stars, fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> They say, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Kozak, his co-workers, director Joshua Sieftel, and even the actors concerned, no doubt, were planning to make an anti-war film. Everything biting and funny like Robert Altman's, unfortunately for the viewer, ended up with an unnamed And not as clever as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> The current status of US policy and foreign policy and the "effort" of the war is already absurd, and as a result, tragic and pathetic and, unfortunately, a comedy - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: You can not write funny stuff like the Bush administration does every day, so why are you trying to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem in WI is that they feel they were put together in a hurry. To accomplish this, Cusack changed mainly Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and placed on a shopping list of ideas derived from the works collected from Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas were shocked in your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film, and what makes them very repugnant is not the jokes, gags or clear signs intended to Halliburton, the neoconservatives and the American occupation of Iraq, are fictional, intelligent or funny. The writers blinded their own faith and felt that once these issues were referred to, the film would be funny and devastating. The problem is ... not. Now these ideas are the news of yesterday, and unless you live under the weight of the bet or are blinded by ignorance, denial and utter stupidity (read: right-wing Christian), these jokes are ridiculously simple. <br /> <br /> WI may work if it is more accurate, destructive, degrading, and fattening with detailed research / insights on the occupation. As it is, the jokes and the smell of the eyes are all superficial and very bad, with a little ingenuity and ingenuity or cynical evil, they did little to make me moan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny because it's true" and The Daily Show is installed every night. However, War, Inc. Being real does not make it funny. Bottom line: Exaggeration is not required when it comes to irony of US / neoconservative politics ... It's already a joke big enough. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
