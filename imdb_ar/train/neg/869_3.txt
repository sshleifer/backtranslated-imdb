Where to start ... If this movie is a dark comedy, I would say it was fantastic! Unfortunately for me, and for anyone else who has free time and a profit to keep (keep in mind that this is the price you paid, and got it from Wal-Mart), it was supposed to be exciting. The only excitement I got was watching Will Wilkes from Kirkland from Misery without a snow forest area. If you want to laugh well, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, I highly recommend this film. But if you want to watch something at least halfway, do not even worry. <br /> <br /> I enjoy watching crazy movies, the better in most cases. But wow ... I mean WOW! The only person in the entire film who did not get mad was the little boy, played by Vincent Perry. The only reason for giving me 3 stars is that he gave me something I do.
