Man, it's amazing how someone can claim that global warming is science, well, I think this elite nonsense now replaces eugenics! Al Gore tries to make the subject seem complicated, although he just needs common sense to see it all as a big hoax for a man with a winning agenda! <br /> <br /> How did scientists estimate the historical temperature of this planet? By estimating the sun's activity. Has anyone ever wondered if this method is accurate? No, not even Gore himself! How would it be incorrect to predict future temperatures using sunspots activity if that was accurate in the past? According to the activity of the sun's spot, the day's temperature is entirely consistent with what it should be. How has the temperature of the whole universe (relatively) increased as much as it does on Earth? Do our SUVs cause a high temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to discover that this can only be a trick. Please search for yourself. What does Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (the banking family that arranged a live event of the earth) benefit from this? Well, the new World Bank will be founded on carbon credits, and this is a tax on all that results in carbon dioxide neglect. It would be easier to get rid of these taxes if people were tempted to believe that it was saving the world when it was just about money, centralized control and more. Power to elite bankers. Al Gore has a company selling carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay carbon credits voluntarily to save the world, especially if he goes to his own company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blindly, please do your research and use your common sense and I'm sure you'll reach the right result!
