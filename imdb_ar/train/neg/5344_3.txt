Spice Girls remembers how damaging it is (along with the songs), as well as their manager Simon Fuller (the director of this band also) is making the same mistake in putting S Club (their last favorite) in their own film. S Club: Tina Barrett, John Lee, Bradley Mackintosh, Joe O'Meara, Hannah Sphere, and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermull?) Are essentially asking their boss to rest as they go there while they go. They see themselves on TV! Three of them exchange, and vice versa, half discover that they are a clone done by a greedy world, and the other half has a problem in itself. Also starring Gareth Gates as a copy of himself. This may contain more of a plot than Spice Girls, but along with "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Have A Dream Come True", this is not a mystery to see. Not long after division of the band forever. Adequate!
