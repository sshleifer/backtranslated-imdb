Well - first negatives: Alligator Crocodile '70' (all right, Correction - Cayman) with immovable limbs is the worst for underwater shots underwater (with full reptile length compared to boat size) using crocodile toy wandering around the game boat in water lit on a scale Wide - even in nighttime shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most Westerners who exploit exploitative killing, it seems that the indigenous superstitions are going **** and are starting to slay the holidaymakers unjustifiably this time. No one really hurts the parents - exploiting, yes, but away from abusive treatment. After all, one of the aborigines (rowing with a pampered model during the full moon) was the one who brought the Devil River curse on them, right? <br /> <br /> The holidaymakers are easily inconvenienced (with the exception of the icon of the old spirit / moderate rowing - the little girl who takes a shine to the heroes she often sees in the seventies of the last century), but far from being entitled to violent death - unless Neighbors door, block you. In fact, the couple are killed because they are pulsed - it is worth noting that neither of them plays the role of the owner. There are only two straight villains in the entire film, so the demons feel more abused than ignored. <br /> <br /> The sequence where the giant Cayman descends and puts a scarf for thirty tourists in less than five minutes will accidentally hit you hilariously. <br /> <br /> The point where indigenous people decide not to wipe out surviving Westerners and say in practice "Hey, you're not bad after all, sorry for that hype last night" - because they blew up the monster lizard - was it shaken Your head as horny music begins. As you know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village in order to **** with the tourist trade after the end credits ... <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know why you're interested in this film in the first place, right? I think so. If you're a Bach supplement, show No DVD NoShame earlier this year (digitally re-numbered without any real additions to talk about, regardless of the way out of the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half bad, being away from the idiot (always being extra in B movies), the little indolent child provides the most comic satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Worth watching, but get it cheaply!
