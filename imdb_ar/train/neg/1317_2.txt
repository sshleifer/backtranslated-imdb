When people at Kino Video assembled the stunning Slapstick Encyclopedia, a multi-cassette collection of silent comedy, one of them decided to start the first batch using ONE TOO MANY (1916), a monstrous monstrous farce produced at the Florida Junior Championship Very Oliver Hardy. As the team was very pleasant, the decision was regrettable, as ONE TOO MANY is a very bad movie that almost dissuades viewers from watching. Like a typical farce, this trick involves deception inspired by greed and panic when the plans explode, and the complications multiply to the point of absurdity. But unlike what is good, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, uncommon, and completely disquieting. It's hard to say at this point whether the hopelessly hopeless conspiracy is the result of the loss of inefficient footage or filmmaking, but no matter what the reason, by the middle of the road, even the most predictable viewer has no idea of ​​personal relationships or what is happening. In the end no one cares anymore. <br /> <br /> The only important point here is to see 24-year-old Fatna Hardy, who looks much heavier than a decade ago when he collaborated with Stan Laurel, but is full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, Beep wakes up against a dangling background, piping a sporty bed back. Trust me, this is as funny as this movie gets. If you read this before watching the first cassette of the Slapstick Encyclopedia, I suggest that you move forward quickly and move on to good things.
