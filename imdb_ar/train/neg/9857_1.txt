I just finished watching this movie and found it basically not funny at all. <br /> <br /> I am an RPG player (computer type, I do not own any desktop stuff) but I did not find any of the jokes in this funny at all. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to go away too much (the tilt and zoom could be reduced to 5 seconds instead of more than a minute) and the director seemed to be just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Acting in itself was not bad, the standard that B Grade should be. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that you take care of this movie only if you are a fan of DND and even though it would be better to stay away from it.
