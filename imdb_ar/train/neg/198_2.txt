Bert Kennedy used to be a very good way out, but you would never know him through this sterile mess. Not only is this film cheap, but it is also cheap - most of the battle scenes have been lifted from the last "super-order" since 1955, and these 32-year-old shots appear to be more contemporary than anything else in this picture. The few motion pictures already filmed for this film are unorganized, distorted and inefficient, and seem as modest as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and it does not seem to budget much more). It moves like a molasses, and most of the representation is either a high-fat pork or a coma - although Raul Julia comes better than most other actors - and he is full of annoyance. Historical errors. Moreover, it is too long. If you're making a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and get it more - do not stretch it for more than three hours, as this movie does. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this film stole his scenes. It's hard to believe that it took six producers to produce such a bad film. skip it.
