Unfortunately, more downs than ups. The plot was very decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but he had a story, unlike other modern horror clicks. The other good thing was cast. I'm not saying that acting was good, because it was not, but every actor / actress was warm and attractive. <br /> <br /> Among recent events, the film became exciting only after the first 40 years or so. The rest was very boring. Another down (or you can count it up if you want) is excessive nudity. All four girls were naked for a few minutes, and all the men showed their heels for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror film, not the movie Dreamers. <br /> <br /> Unless you are so desperate to watch someone take off his clothes and run a few minutes shame, or watch a girl naked for no reason, or you are a fan of Debbie Rochon fanatics, this is the right movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
