I saw this on the cable recently and enjoyed it kinda. I have read the comments here and everyone seems to like the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (very bad that was not extended.) The second story, as I thought, was vulgar. This "California Dream", if I heard that again ... Chungking Express is fine, but it is not something the mainstream audience will see to see it, such as "Crouching Tiger".
