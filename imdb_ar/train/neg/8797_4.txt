The endless frenzy of smart optical paradoxes does not necessarily create an attractive film. Half of the movie "The Blonde Wig" was never launched at all because of the frequent indulgence of its makers. <br /> <br /> Half Wong Faye (appears in a very playful type, if you look Karen Carpenter and Fay Wong) holds so much more appeal. However, all the ingredients exist, however, taking the girls story element to meet the boy's back seat to artistic intelligence. Personal development is unequal. Passion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, "Mung Jung Yun" from Wong Faye (Cantonese version of the successful "Cranberry" "Dreams") is used effectively at Chungking Express. Fei Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called "Chen Tuo." Both are located on a CD-ROM, although "Jung Mung Yun" was found only on the movie audio CD.
