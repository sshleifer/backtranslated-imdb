I watched this on a whim because it was available and I heard Thumb movies were funny. This was not. The majority of jokes about fitness were based on "geranium" and, therefore, Kate Winslet. I think it's pathetic indeed for the "thumb" creators who come down so much that they make a respectable actress just because they (heaven forbid) do not starve themselves into the ideal modern model of beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that matches, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim in this temporary raft that no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of entertainment from a 26-minute film does not replace its value.
