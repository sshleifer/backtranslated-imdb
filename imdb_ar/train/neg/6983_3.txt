The revolution is a terrible film, I do not care if you are a teacher of history or a news writer or a fan of Al Pacino, there is no way you can win this movie "10". <br /> <br /> The key points to the plot as Tom Dup (al) tries to get money from a note he got for the extreme patriots who board his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom joins the army to make up for the memo, and Tom joins the army as well, and they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years after the end of the war, and can finally write down the note of their boat. End. <br /> <br /> She had some battle scenes and was very modest at best. The transitions between the scenes were used "after five months" and the characters were magically placed in some of the famous historical battles. The story of love is a joke, and the film as a whole is difficult to follow. So save your "notes" and see Patriot instead.
