I like to think of myself as a fairly open man and it takes me to hate a movie, but this movie is without doubt one of the hottest and fastest films ever! <br /> <br /> I have no idea of ​​the error in the people who gave it a good rating here (imdb is usually very reliable when it comes to assessments) ... The only thing I can imagine is that people must have voted during One or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. During stabbing / stoning 2. They received hard money for votes 3. At gunpoint <br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted an hour One 45 minutes of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.
