I love the diary so I read the book twice; it's one of the best books I read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and I was afraid that reading the book would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. I did not expect the film to be so bad. Some of the best part of the book was deleted from the film and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I do not read the book, it will be a bit confusing and inexplicable. Little land plot in the film "Neta Saori reveals how she exceeded her catch ..." Forget the movie and read the book.
