Well, let me say I did not expect Jerry Springer to be a movie. All I asked was to be a movie ... and it was not. It looked like someone bad home movies. He behaves badly, written, and full of trance from the most unattractive people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film's "plot" focuses on a low-class family who decide to move to the "Jerry Varelli Show" to discuss multiple issues between the mother, daughter, stepmother and fiancee. From there, the film falters and develops into a unique experience: pornography from the trash. There is an underdeveloped sex, interacial sex, and even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of theater and get another circumcision. At least it was short with mercy. Disgusting and humiliating. Americans of African descent and America of the working class must be humiliated. (However, Howard Stern should be happy, he did not waste his attempt to get stardom.) He was smart, funny and fun. <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F +
