Seriously, I love these old movies and are quite simple, but I saw this for the first time last night and it was easy to put it at the bottom of the five at all times. Was it supposed to be about a love story or a zombie ??? The film was so bad that it ended with all my mercy. All I could do was laugh at how bad it was. Luckily, I'm too wicked to turn off the movie without seeing everything else or else I will not be able to boast of watching this all the time in one session! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so in line with that theory, I will recognize the most important origins of this film, it was too short for a full-length film.
