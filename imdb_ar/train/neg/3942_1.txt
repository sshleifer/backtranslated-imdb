Oh my God, what a terrible film. The film contains all the right people involved, unfortunately not worth watching. I saw him for free in my local library. If I had paid to see this I would be more angry. This movie is inaccessible. How can Tarintino participate in such a slow-moving and unsurprising film No wonder it did not get much distribution, everyone should be ashamed I can make a better film using a dated video camera and the top of my toe. After her boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be a kind of sick humor. Do not care about this movie. If some hint to watch it, kill them.
