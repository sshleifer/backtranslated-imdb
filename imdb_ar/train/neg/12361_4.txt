I saw Woody Allen last because I'm a fan of his work and I refer to trying to see everything he does, although the ratings of this film have led me to expect a disappointing effort. They were right. It's a messy film that can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about the midlife crisis of females. It is a failure at all. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a middle-aged, troubled woman who has married a great fortune and lives a life of useless luxury with her rather boring husband with two young children. The concept of this mundane plot is as animated as the ancient Chinese folk difficulties that make it invisible with some magical herbs, and the ghost of a former lover (flying with him over Manhattan). If these plugins are too great for you, what about something more interesting, like a relationship with a saxophone player? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this mixed mixing was trying to say. There are only a few really funny moments in the film, and the finishing touches Platina of Poliana. <br /> <br /> Instead, he hired "misdemeanor and misdemeanor" crimes instead, a wonderful film that was successfully completed combining comedy with ethics and ethics. Or return to Annie Hall or Manhattan.
