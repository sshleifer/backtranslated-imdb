I do not see how anyone who likes Van Damen can love this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually begins with some promises. I would say that the motion scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. Scenes in which the Family Wing tries to save the twins are a great start and are a good introduction to the main story. However, the film is all down the hill from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been good if the director could have stayed with the original hypothesis. This is the brothers who are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One of the brothers is supposed to be skilled in martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How appropriate it is when the time comes for a brother who has never carried a weapon above all a surprise to be a wonderful head, and that the brother who did not study any martial arts is all that the splits and high kicking. <br /> <br /> The plot, action, etc. is just ridiculous ridiculous. My favorite viewers? What about when Van Damne faces an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of targeting Van Damen and shooting at him, he screamed like a military ax and ran on it. Van Damen goes to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him ... while still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the most frustrating endings. Polo Young is a skilled military artist. However, instead of designing a decent battle. Polo dumps Van Damne like Donkey Kong. The film is absolutely intense that promised a lot. If you're a fan of Van Damne, save your time and see Hard Target or one of his previous movies.
