That's right, you heard me. I am a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books and read the entire series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenplay should be shot. <br /> <br /> What is the right of any filmmaker to slaughter a fantastic fiction and make it a mockery of this mysterious genre? If I thought Harry Potter had been slaughtered, Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter who handles this wonderful book will do a lot of justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not leave your daily work.
