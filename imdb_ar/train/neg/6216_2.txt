9, the movie that I've been looking at for months .... it was a little more disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the loss of the ninth story and the development of her exotic character. All the wonderful events in the world do not make up for a person who is not sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The stranger, who was almost in a mysterious sequence, was not only misplaced, he was also angry. The story revolves around robots and scientists ... Why do you suddenly turn into a niliconum horror rebel with mystical symbols and ghostly green ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could be an awesome storytelling device? <br /> <br /> How, what, when and why ... Questions that promise to ask only whether you care and become less likely that you will escape the stage. <br /> <br /> A film like this is frustrating because it is not in depth .... I was watching this movie in a pencil if the story was good. But filmmakers have relied on CGI witches and Tim Burton's name to attract audiences. Which ... is what attracted me but failed to win my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been fantastic ... with a few other rewrites and a little more respect from the creators.
