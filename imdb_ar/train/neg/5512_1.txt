Put a DVD of this click in a time capsule, and will certainly show future generations an ideal example of generations that ensure a minimum rating on a scale from a star to a ten star. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano were at the top - in rankings and tens of millions of profits annually - with the TV series'. However, neither of them succeeded in large performances. This was also true for other television personalities - perhaps because many stories that are presented for two hours or more seem more appropriate for a 10 minute or more comedy play in 22 or 23 minutes of drama during half an hour program. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not contain one item that may take two or three minutes of time on a MAD, SNL or other TV or theater. <br /> <br /> The date of its inception is listed in 2002, but the release date - on DVD only - is shown in 2004. It was also filmed shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield, so the only recovery value is that it Likely to be saved in a lease contract a few hundred thousand extra dollars to his heirs. <br /> <br /> I never heard of it, but I found it when I ran my group, and frankly I became fascinated by it. Some movies are really terrifying to the point that they have some sort of higher rating in the opposite direction - so bad that you can move the dial back to 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the best example - Bruce Jenner / Village people working for " Can not turn off music ", something else. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a short click up there. Even if Rodney's previous work (as well as some of his fellow cast members) was less than "citizen citizen" or "Casablanca", there were many moments of humor and a story that offered little attention at least. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have a minute or two of these materials.
