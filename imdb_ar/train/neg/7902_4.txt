Nice and fun, but lame and cheap. "Munchies" is another clone of Gremlins coming out of the 1980s. I am not a lover of tradition. <br /> <br /> First, the "Gremlins" was excellent. <br /> <br /> Then came the average "creatures". <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the 'Ghoulies' lousy. <br /> <br /> But the full drill must go to "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> <br /> The "Munchies" for me must now be somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". In fact, I might find it more fun than "Ghoulies", but I preferred the dark tone. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, she plays her role in the vulgar nature (which is best for her), but due to this nature, the corpulent representation (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), can be arrogant instead see only munchies on amok. This is where the fun happens. The story is mainly focused on snacks (either hungry or horny or destructive) in a whole series of alleged comedies (some moments working) in the small desert town on the chase. It's silly, but strangely attractive thanks to the agile speed. The creatures themselves look rather nice and poorly detailed, as they are basic dolls being choked. In terms of their personalities reached is that they can actually speak ... and position. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and the frantic Van der Veldy Club (which was in the movie "The Creatures") were the fair strands. Harvey Kurman was acceptable in two rounds. Robert Piccardo also emerges. <br /> <br /> Entertainment is great entertainment and comfortable to relax.
