This is the worst show. Buntch from the grown up acting like children does not humor anything. Even Sesame Street enjoys a more cheerful spirit and more adults than friends "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen in television and I was sitting in front of a tube that friends notice "simply does not knit well with others who lack the intelligence of" Seinfeld " The characters in "Friends" are designed to make them bored. <br /> <br /> The non-smart exhibition is completely without any edge of any kind ... Characters are the cartoons of the cartoons and the writing is the second year - Though intentional on it. (It may be interesting to observe the kite session Since the book has been forced to bondage with a goal less than their abilities so as not to confuse loyal friends with "friends.")
