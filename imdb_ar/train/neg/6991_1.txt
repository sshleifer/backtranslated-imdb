Just do not bother. I thought I would watch a great movie that was exciting and exciting. <br /> <br /> It grows terribly dull and unpredictable after an interesting start. In the middle of the film, you have little social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down speed. In the end, the situation improves but is not good. I think the director took this film very seriously. In such films, even if you are not interested in the plot, you at least want some nice action. I almost missed the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
