It's getting worse, the series is going downhill. The first and second result was acceptable, and since then we have seen a lot of really terrible movies. Robert Englund performs another great performance like Freddy, but the rest of the acting team can not act. The story is Alice, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddie Krueger starting again. This time, the funny killer attacks the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddie is his dead mother, but can Alice free her soul in time to save her son? Check out the first three, miss the next three and then watch the last one.
