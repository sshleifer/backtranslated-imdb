"It seems that many critics find that the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama is not palatable." And for good reason: it is an intolerable wooden tradition and tradition of Bergman. Let's not deceive ourselves: most critics have supported Alan Bergman's claims, despite Allen's accusations to the contrary. What I did not get is this: Why did Allen generally applaud his authenticity in the Bergman tradition, but contemporary Brian Dibalma was eager to "break" Hitchcock in his thrilling movies? From Robin Wood's point of view, it is a strange form of cultural intrusion. I must agree with that.
