Dear ... As an Englishman, a small part of Wales, a fan of the work of Anthony Hopkins in the industry ..... So far, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I am no one, and who was hoping for the best. So my comments are "hay in the wind". But, this is the point is not it? - I have no ax to grind the business value of the business. I, as a full member of a great unwashed person, go to watch a movie to be moved to another place. Yes, stop faith briefly. But not to enter into a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If this was by an unknown author and director, I think this "production" would have been forgotten. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and my eyes were left blank. After seeing some of the rave reviews given this work, I am very concerned .... <br /> <br /> Perhaps I try, without any bias, to show each film on its own merits. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the reputation of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: Do not write and direct the same production. It is risky. Movies must be modified to maintain the appearance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports "they can and can do better ..."
