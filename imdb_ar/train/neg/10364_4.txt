This book is so good that the opening of this TV movie will at least be transferred to you, but then, because it is more and more different from the book, and all the religion, love, mathematics, and slices of cotton candy, becomes boring. However, from the comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if it even leads to a baby reading wrinkles in time, it will be. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Happy Clone for Mary Poppins Uncle Albert (I love laughter). There is no reason to be motivated, as the characters on the screen laugh with joy at things that are not quite familiar.
