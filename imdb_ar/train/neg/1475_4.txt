Most of the episodes in the first season are terrifying. There is no comparison to the Twilight Zone or the Outer Limits, as the programs already have decent storylines. Most of the amazing stories are boring well ... not at least amazing ... rent or buy a Twilight Zone series ... I've heard that the second season of this series is much better ... and also for some reason on the DVD they made parts of Ray and Sixty that reduce This assembly. The only wonderful thing is seeing actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most story lines are very predictable, and the series may be better through twists and turns that you left wondering ...
