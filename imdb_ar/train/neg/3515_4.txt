Basically a typical propaganda film for a good last war. But there were some things that shocked me. It was the first use of oral moments. In two cases, Scott's character outperforms one, once at first when his bomb falls off the target during the bomb ("damn") and once when he tries to influence the bombardier to become a pilot ("* *% t"). The third case is when Ann Shirley wants the character of the O'Brien farewell and wish you good luck ("Give 'em hell") to the roar of the engines. "Heck." I also found an interest in a person who has moral problems in bombing, specifically bombing civilians. Because of what we know about LeMay's subsequent strategy of bombing Japanese cities with fire, this scene plays little irony: I remember Mknmara's quote to Lomay in the "fog of war", which is what If the United States does not win the conflict, it will be prosecuted as a war criminal, and the end is too much, in line with the film, reminding me a little bit of the end of White Heat (I do not compare movies, but the end!). Maybe the reason is that it explodes. Really good burst !!!
