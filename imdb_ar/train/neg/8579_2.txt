I am afraid this is a very awful one, despite many good performances and generally qualified camera direction. This is the first and last attempt by director Su Liu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is an unfortunate byproduct of Canada's program to promote local filmmaking. While the program promotes worthwhile efforts such as "New Waterford Girl," it opens the door to uneducated novices such as Leo who did not have to actively promote this project but were highlighted without sufficient examination of their script or credentials. <br /> <br /> Do not mind the budget drop because the design of shabby production, poor lighting, poor sound and the choice of a ducky docy pick technique corresponds to the subject; workers at Canadian massage parlors. But dialogue and planning do not give actors anything to work with, or the editor who brings him together too much, or the spectator any mental challenge does not suspend disbelief. When your story is so simplistic, the last thing you need is a mixed novel style; although nothing happens, it's hard to follow the film and it's impossible to determine its point of view. <br /> <br /> The performance of Don McKellar in Conrad is several degrees without a similar description in "Exotica". Lynda Booth Lea is her unusual air head standard; as always she is lovable but here is a little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role for any result, Betty Tara Spencer-Nairn, more than eliminates her excellent performance at the New Waterford Girle. Her shallow performance in "Rub and Tug" should reduce her tendency to look for other films that have appeared in her, unless you need more emphasis on the director's talent of Alan Moyle from Waterford in working with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that Leo's reptile mind can not understand concepts such as the complexity of the plot, so the need to insert a "deus ex machina" lazy and lame in the end is no surprise. However, it may be worse. The meaningless story does not have a large internal logic anyway, so the end is not as painful as it usually is. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
