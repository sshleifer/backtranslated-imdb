Well, I saw the film, despite its appearance last year ... I thought it was a good film in general, except for the film that was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we did not know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, are they They do in our world, and really, were they on Earth before we were or did they just come out of space? Secondly, it is clear that the role of the butcher in maintaining the system was clearly created ... Really, to what extent could the size of the subway for a substation be? There were only a large number of these creatures, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could only plant some tactical bombs, or perhaps remove them, and Nuk did the job. I know it sounds funny and so, but I do not think killing people is necessary ... Third, Leon acts like a superman as he jumps in the train and fights Vinnie Johnny, who was taller and bigger in stature. Then again, when he faces the connector, he does nothing and acts as if he is cloudy, watching all the abominations. I mean well, Mosul got a creepy help (lol), but if Leon was very brave he would have gone all the way ... I mean he risks his life first, and then does nothing exactly when he should have. He could have died as a hero but he lives like a coward ... this may be the case, but not yet show much courage early ... Then, the cop thing ... Come on! This was a city with a subway, and I bet there must be other cops except for that lady, and other police stations, this was kind of really ridiculous ... all in all, the wonderful work by Vinnie Johnny, an interesting idea even The reason why it is not built at all ... By the way, what do the signs on the box mean? Finney can not compensate for the rest ...
