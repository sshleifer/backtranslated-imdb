- A small cover for a short time deceive the head of the local mob of a lot of money. Of course, the mob leader wants to recover his money and does not care who he should kill him for. The villain evokes his friend and an old man to help save his life. <br /> <br /> If this sounds silly, then it will be. The complete idea that this buggy buggy in Izod, which can prevent one of the most powerful mobs in Rome, is just a silly idea. His friend may be well armed, but he faces a group of trained killers. The old villain is nothing more than mere comic relief and not real help when it comes to confronting the mob. There is also a sub-plot about how the father of a friend was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there is little of him and he did not help the film at all. <br /> <br /> - Head of the mob, Mr. Scarface, played by Jack Ballens. I suppose he got the name because he has something like a nike shave on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the actors, doing what he needs to get a check. <br /> <br /> - I've seen some good Italian crimes / conditional clicks recently, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check out the Guild of Sadiens or the pistol instead.
