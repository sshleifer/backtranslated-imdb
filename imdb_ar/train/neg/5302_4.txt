Dewaana film passes through the usual cliches. A man and woman are in love and marriage, the husband is supposed to be killed by a family friend who wants his family fortune, and once again married her husband's sudden husband number 1. The film reminds us of Yash Chopra's Chandni and countless others. Devia Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan are offering good performances. Amriche Puri as a villain goes through the moves and is no more than a wicked Bollywood standard. Nadim Sharvan's music is wonderful, all the songs are wonderful. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Diwana is a regular movie that goes through movements.
