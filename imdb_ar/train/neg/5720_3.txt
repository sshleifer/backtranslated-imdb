Some gorehound friends recommend "Live Feed" to me, and basically I can not really grumble because the film certainly offers ample amounts of stain and spoiled buckets, but of course it's not a very good movie. Ryan Nicholson tries more than the latest in horror cinema, the so-called Torture Porn, and overtakes every other film in this sub-genre (including "Hostel" and "Saw" models) with his patients - twisted-up make-up, Experienced mixed, tried their suffering and begged for their lives. There is no real conspiracy to describe. Five friends of twenty something do not amaze, take a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but otherwise I do not really know why they choose to travel there instead of traveling to Cancun. They are obviously not interested in the culture of continents, but they cause a frantic scene when they watch a local dog slaughter a nice puppet in the market. The Pentagram later plunged into an angry nightlife and one of them offended the leader of a criminal clan. It is clear that apology is simply not enough, as gangs follow them in an adult theater and subject them all to brutal torture. One of the girls has her scary breasts while another poor snake has a poisonous snake pushing her throat down; The "live broadcast" is amazingly boring despite all the bloodshed and it is very difficult to ignore the values ​​of amateur production, even if you are used to watching independent cinema for movie lovers like this. The fat on the cover, the S & M Oriental Skeleton, is just as wonderful and the most talented in the entire group, because at least he keeps his mouth shut all the time. I do not highly recommend this heap of filth, but hey, if you like the loud and grotesque metal music, the tortured torture scenes and the loathsome losers, go ahead and watch!
