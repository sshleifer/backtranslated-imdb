I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to protect others from the terrible and very terrible "horror" film. Do not waste your time or money in this film. The representation is bad, and the story is only one of the worst events I've ever had. The script was so bad. Nothing was good, you ended up thinking to yourself why I was watching this nonsense. The plot contains a lot of holes and was never cleared at the end. It was so bad, and I do not know how to make a very terrible film. As I said before, I love horror movies and I was scared, she was 18 years old but you saw little blood and do not scare or jump at all. Also what bothered me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no meaning on earth like kissing brother and sister, why? Is all I can say. Do not bother, there are so many wonderful horror movies, do not waste your time very short life.
