For some time, she saw Sleuth (1972) with great actors Michael Keane and Laurence Olivier. Michael Cain returned, but he is now the husband's presence if his wife's lover. The story is still a wonderful play. <br /> <br /> I always felt during the film watching a play. This is one of the reasons I did not like this new version of the classic. When I watch a drama, I still feel like seeing a movie, not just a play. Director Kenneth Branigan made some great films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason is the appearance of the film. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cool. I never felt that someone lived in this house. The shooting was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was a light blue, dark and green, to approximate it is not friendly to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The acting was really good. The performance of Michael Keane and Lu's presence at their best. I really like to see these guys playing together on stage. But I have to admit that I was not a lover of Good Lou. The weaker part was the middle part. I remember that it was originally that this part was still vague and directed only. I tried to watch it twice and always in the middle part I felt sleepy. The latter part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be a film of critics rather than audience. Sleuth (1972) remains a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
