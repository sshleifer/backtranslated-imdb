Band Camp was great, and The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third level appeared directly on DVD in the American Pie franchise with the same quality of advances. Basically, Eric Steffler (John White) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike Kozooz Kozman (Jake Siegel) joined Eric Dwight's cousin Steve Steve at the college. With the promise of many parties, lots of wine, and a sufficient number of hot chicks in the House House, they have only fifty tasks listed to be implemented to become official members. But there is a threat that comes to the fore with its competitors, GEK ("Geek") House, led by power-hungry nerd (and shagger shapper) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), which offers greater and better than Beta. To settle it once and for all, Beta and Gek fought the battle with the banned, for forty years, Greek games to beat each other, with the loser out. Another hero of the games, Noah Levinstein nicknamed James Dad (the only usual Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees people devoid of bras, wrestling wrestling float on the water, catching a greasy pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with brave horse cartridges, wife carrying and drinking drums Full of alcohol (with no puking not qualified). All this comes to sudden death, with a man dancing in the lap of a stripper, and they have to resist Cumming, winning a house house when Edgar uses a girl wearing a sheep in his lap. He was starring Christopher McDonald in Flubber as Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic in Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, And Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, and Andreja Punkris as as Stacy and Jordan Brentes as Rock. The amount of nudity is increased very little, as in the magnitude of jokes, I can think that one star was rated out of five, but I love it. Adequate!
