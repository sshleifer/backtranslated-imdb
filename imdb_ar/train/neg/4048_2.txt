Probably not, but it's awful. Even a wonderful cast can not be saved. Well, I admit it was very funny, but it seemed to go down as soon as those girls jumped into the generals' house. Bill Murray turned from being a quick-humored and humorous man to Archie who was shouting things on the street that were not funny, he was trying hard to be funny. His character was stolen by a weapon (ruff?) ... and ends up being a national hero after the invasion of another country and the killing of God knows the number of soldiers, in order to laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US military and shows how arrogant they are, albeit inadvertently. I was already disgusted that this kind of publicity crap could really be issued.
