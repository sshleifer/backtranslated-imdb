I can not believe that the man himself was the face of this nonsense and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, new and well written, if behaved badly. <br /> <br /> This heap can not even claim it. Begins with Dracula's defeat at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignores the narrative afterwards and describes what happened next. By following the narration correctly he could have made this a good sequel somehow, but Craven chose to go in the style of his old movies, not having a good relationship but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor who plays Dracula is different (moving from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to Blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in the movies.
