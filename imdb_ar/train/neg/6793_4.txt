Brave, West of Morocco director Richard Brooks, who seems completely involved in this genre while maintaining all the usual cliches intact. In the early 1900s, low-level cowboys (Jane Hackman), a cute gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jean-Michael Vincent), and even ladies (an amazing game, Candice Bergen) are attracted to the race. Once the preliminaries have finished (with predictable arguments as to whether or not women should participate), this is a fairly attractive entry, although it does not break new ground (it is something like Gary Cooper's) . Good looking, if the long piece has an impressive motivation and a wonderful mold, the mechanisms of the plot become fairly quick. ** from ****
