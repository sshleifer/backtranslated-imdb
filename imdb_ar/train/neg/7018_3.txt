Completely forgotten. Especially because of poor representation. This is the first film I saw with Dax Sheppard. To my surprise, it has existed since the late 1990s. I thought he was a newcomer, since his behavior was very nice. I can say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw her well in other films, she gave Claire Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the actress who will give the character a fire and emotional character like Diane Keaton, but it was strange to see her lines in a whisper. It seems that there simply was not very good chemistry among actors, and I think Diane Keaton felt it too. She was a wonderful actress, but she looked a bit taller in this film. She felt like she just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I will not blame it.
