Do not you hate it when you ask for a steak but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> So I felt like watching the so-called "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments about its quality can be made, but the fact remains that it is not what fans have asked. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in this restaurant that you mentioned. I waited years to recover the famous New York steak I loved. When you arrive at your meal, you find that they applied the name "New York Strip" on a chicken platter. You complain but the waiter only states "but ze zi, really good jerk zir"! Are you really interested if the chicken is good? You want New York Strip - steak! Then the waiter explains, "You zee zir, ze chef wanted to do, you zay, new zomezing." We felt that ze cheeken would be more popular in Zo we called it the former tasty dish. You ask if you will find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future but you know that since the restaurant has a dish called "New York Strip" now on the menu, you will not see the original New York Strip bar - again. <br /> <br /> This is the case with the creation of something new and pressing the name "Battlestar Galactica" on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is an insult to all lovers of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the production team responsible for this new version has clearly despised the original. BG's team should have liked the original series - trying to improve what fans like, not trying to sell the new series without shame by exploiting Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If SciFi is required to give us a new offer, then do so! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we proudly remember to try to attract viewers. This effectively deprives us of the opportunity to see any form of origin in the future. <br /> <br /> We were waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we loved something about the origin! We simply did not want the name and remnants of the basic concept. There are things we liked about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the best original items may have been deleted. Sure, the original BG was incomplete and could use some update. However, this mini-series was not an improvement in either aspect; it had special effects (which were good but were not something as unusual as today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss the quality and quality of this new presentation but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> This is said ... I will make some comments about the advantages of this new mini in itself (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequence was the best part. Obviously the effort was put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at this effect". I can not say that these sequences were exceptional according to today's standards, but they were compatible with original movies designed specifically for cable. What is the deal with this "live pseudo camera"? I tried some fake views of the "real" camera effect with backward tracking and jerking jerks. However, the overuse was considering the lack of a clear source for these cameras. The most intelligent, borderless series, Babel 5, is the only example where I saw "live cameras" used effectively when we were actually seeing security cameras. <br /> <br /> Script, you ask? The script felt like it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. I felt cardboard characters and stereotypes. In fact, I felt the entire story is cluttered with other stereotypes known. The only good features of the whole story were those few items that were preserved from the original series. It is clear that it is "failed" to digest your normal television audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was pitiful. Instead of drama based on subtle appearance, expressions and good timing, every moment of human tension was so exaggerated that it lost its ability to move any high-end scenes. This was evident in any interaction between Adama and his son. The director must be trying to make sure that the most intense and non-sensual viewer will not miss it even if he does not notice. Sorry, but real humans do not act constantly. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered this a bad show if it were self-contained. Nothing great will not be revered by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it will be possible to watch it by the masses. Personally I could have lived without it. I saw it only to see how it really possessed the spirit of origin. <br /> <br /> How will this mini-series always be remembered as a symbol of how to put story quality aside to attract more numbers? How SciFi Channel even "reduced" its production to meet the needs of the masses rather than its real niche market, Science Fiction fans. This would be the time when we asked for steak and insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with just one idea - <br /> <br /> No "Moore". <br /> <br />
