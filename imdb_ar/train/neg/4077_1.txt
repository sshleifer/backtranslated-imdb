What do you get when you have bad behavior, bad steering, very long scenes, awful lighting, painful editing, and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story, they seem to be filmed on betacam, which is good, but lighting must complement this medium. In this case no. There are a few CU where the entire person's face is in the shade. One scene in particular is the scene when psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some scenes were so long that it was easy to cut in half ... but I think there will not be a long film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the leading man, so he must have some "hero" elements of his character, but he does not. He whine and scared the entire film. I can continue, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting was awful, I have to say that they have a nice camera movement. Too bad lighting did not complete it. Cute DVD cover, here ends. Just awful.
