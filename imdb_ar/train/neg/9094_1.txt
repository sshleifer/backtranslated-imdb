Well, let me split it up, you guys ... it's horrible! <br /> <br /> If Roger Comble performed a fictional mission in the first cruel intentions, why did he do this bad job? I'm sorry but this movie is stupid, it's true that it might have improved if it was broadcast at all but let's be realistic ... this movie is a game of pottery! Lots of bad behavior * Note shower scene * "Kissing cousins" ?????? What kind of line is this? "Slippery when wet" ??????????? You could tell DUH-M! This film has struggled and I will give it to you, but it was so stupid! They even tried to make them funny by giving home servants stupid accents which in fact .... were not funny! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they made everyone in this shape never seem like the original representatives. It seems like they made it look different intentionally or something! I love watching it when I'm really really an outlet and this does not happen sometimes. For those of you who loved it ... well, what were you thinking? Could you choose this movie on the other that had a wonderful and wonderful representation of Sarah Michelle Gillard? The movie went if Sarah Michelle Gillard was in it, DUH! But this film does, no crime Amy Adams. Oh, yes since when did Sebastien have a heart ????? Ugh!
