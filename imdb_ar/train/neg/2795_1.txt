Kacia Brady puts a gun in her mouth and blows her back on her boyfriend, Jason Dibler. Cassidy was the main singer of the rock band "Demons and Death" who could not shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect of her (as you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this problem except to put a bullet in your head). However, she returns to the spirit of Dora (Gil Smol) her friend, who will replace her in singing so that the group can finish the album that was stopped by the death of Cassidy prematurely. But, Cassidy made a deal with a dark one and the souls will be gathered ... This anger is consumed mainly by Neil, but all the band members or anyone inside the music studio die when they fall prey to those who think they are a rather horrifying Dora..ly. Cassidy does not return to recovery. <br /> <br /> The horror of the poor small budget is cheap, it has a cheap crew, it has to put plans in another line of action, and boasts of cheap killers that are a little effective.
