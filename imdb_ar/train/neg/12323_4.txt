As many agree, the original is beautifully anime artistically. The music, graphics, and world created are great and stand above most other modern animations. However, if you are looking for more than this, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Beauty stops its appearance, and when it comes to planning and personality, there is nothing special. The work is slow and minimal and people are flat, peddled sometimes, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the pit plot here and the plot's hole there ... So, in short, my God, I've never seen such a beautiful anemia. Oh, my God, it's like ... - Laughter - People do not act like that. It took a giant step forward in graphics and music in the anime, but it also took a few steps back in bad characterization times, and unfortunately, there are not many procedures to make up for it ...
