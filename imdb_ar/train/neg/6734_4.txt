I found this movie to be a wonderful idea, and this was not delivered. They seem to have found a way to build suspense, but they could not arrange their profits well. In one case the police, the clock to find the kidnappers' hideout. They move painstakingly from the dentist to the dentist to match the dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator column. After all the crowds, the police arrive at the same time he is released, which is strongly hostile to the climate. There are also great narrative scenes that take us "inside the thinking" of the husband and wife, who are detested by suspense rather than adding to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and vocal expression is an insult and dislikes the viewer from any chance of a personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has proven time and time again, which is much more effective. The biggest disappointment, is to sit throughout the entire movie, get a quick end, instead of cute. I mean it just ... "ends up" at Snore.
