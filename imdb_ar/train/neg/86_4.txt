As Southern Baptists, it hurts me that I have to give a lower-than-average rating for a candid Christian film. There is certainly not much to desist from the kind of sadly exploited filmmakers. However, I must say frankly that "Love's Abiding Joy" is usually a film with a low budget, low key, and self-awareness. The plot is predictable, the average representation (I'm cute), the editing is terrible. As a television film, it may have been slightly above average, but as a feature film, it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying the players. You have to have a film about real Christians somewhere inside you. Do I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
