When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May of 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey, and this was shown in a four-dimensional attraction (you know, attractive seats that move). I consider that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 minutes) and was also re-created to add animation effects. It was a nice film ... but that was it. He was educated and told us the first task, but the end of spacewalking in the CGI seemed a bit ... well ... vulgar. I was not very impressed with the film, but I recommend this film to any father who wants to tell his children in a fun way about his first moon trip. I will say, the representatives of the characters were well chosen and the characters themselves were nice. So, all in all, I would say, if you want to bring younger children ... follow it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they'll thank you.
