I recently watched the revival of "Blithe Spirit" on Broadway from starring Angela Lansbury, Robert Everett, Christine Ebersol and Jane Atkinson. It's a wonderful production, and explains what good actors can do in a game that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is very funny like Mrs. Arkati. <br /> <br /> It may have been a mistake to see the movie version of Rex Harrison. The film does not enjoy energy or laughter from a good theatrical production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those plays that works best with the cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. Actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance, deliver lines, engage the audience on a personal level that you can not get at the movie house or with a DVD, where the audience is separated from the story of the Fourth Wall. Charles Condomin (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the English countryside. For information about his next book, The Ripper, Charles Madtha Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, retrieved from her original London production in 1941), a local spiritual vehicle, calls for his home for careful study. Charles believes that spirituality is a hoax, but hopes to capture "trade tricks". But then she returns the ghost of Elvira (Kay Hammond), wife of Charles I, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops a competition to spit with Ruth on Charles (complicated by the fact that Charles alone can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage, representatives can make presentations that invite laughter in this position. But on the screen, actors in "Blithe Spirit" rip the lines as if they do not know that anyone is listening. They mumbled lines that were designed to get laughter on stage. The offerings by Harrison, Cummings, and even Hammond Caye are flat and lifeless. It seems that Margaret Rutherford is the only one who has maintained her sparkle and sense of humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning visual effects in the film are not impressive - not only according to today's standards, but according to 1946 standards! Most of them are Hammond Kay wandering around in green clothes and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make them look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. But compare the boring visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" to the truly pioneering effects of Disney's "Song of the South" - which were eligible for awards in the same year. In the "south," people and animated characters share the screen smoothly for a few minutes at a time. Compared to the "South," the Oscars received by Blithe Spirit for special effects were not entirely impossible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can only encourage you to watch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury before it closes / closes. For the film with Rex Harrison, skip it.
