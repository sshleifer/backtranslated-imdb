I had a lot of hopes in this film and watched it with a lot of expectations; mainly because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who set his steps in the sands of time forever. But this film proved to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After watching this film, the brutality and violence in Tenerife and orange orange look much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very bold police officer. Who was appointed to investigate the brutal serial murders. Raghavan finds the link in this case, and he is about to solve the murders. The mental killers, the medical Taliban who suffer from psychological disorders but are adorable, are behind the bars, but they escape and enter the wave of murder again. Finally, Raghavan is killed both after surviving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psychological killers are the two people who will prevent the masses from going to the theaters. Murder, sexual harassment and rape are presented very explicitly, and the film could have survived without it. <br /> <br /> Even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this movie in the theater and that the kind of picture they will paint in their minds is not nice. The director, Gotham, must realize that he is also committed to society and its audience. Certainly I will never go to movies that resemble the Gotham name in the production list.
