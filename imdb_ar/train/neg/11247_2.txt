This film was too much. Many viewers, who thought this "stunning" should be in the old school films, because the entire film was assigned in the past. At first I thought that the film was only showing something from the past, so I expected that the dream would fade like characters, but it was continuous. Basically, this film was trying to blend the future with the past, and the two do not mix well in this film, even with special effects. You can already see the blue screen with which the actors were working. There are a lot of movies that do exactly what this film did, so there's no reason for critics to exaggerate this film, saying, "It's the greatest film ever made." It's just crap on a stick. It also did not help that the story line was sooo crappy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to produce this film, nor do I understand how actors / actresses in this film are willing to be in a movie like this. It looks like everyone read the script and forgot to read the printed version ... "All will be done on a computer." This was a film that had to be on a network of films, because there was nothing revolutionary about this film. I am very upset by myself to pay money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in this movie today or tomorrow.
