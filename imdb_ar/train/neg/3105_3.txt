I can not believe how anyone can make comedy about an issue like homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not make comedy about _real_ homeless. There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in these streets. The people we interviewed in this film have become homeless in the land of Fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat too much. Brooks has become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
