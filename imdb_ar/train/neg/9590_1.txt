The film is based on an original novel from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McKenzie has written a collection of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Scoops" and "Mr. Love and Justice". I have read the three. The two are excellent. The latter, perhaps an experience did not bear fruit. But McKinsey's work was highly acclaimed. And rightly so. This musician is the nightmare of the final novelist - to see the fruit of the individual's mind turn into an obnoxious, hyperactive apology, one dimension from a film that says it embodies the spirit of London in the 1950s, and does nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Thank God Colin Mackinis was not alive to see him.
