Well, I finally saw that. I did not go when I first came out because I was honestly scared. Afraid of how bad it may be, or how disappointing. Although I'm not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it was not so memorable, or was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the initial crawl to the final credits, I have never forgotten a film experience. The immortal story of the farm boy who is bored and knows that he was aiming more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the danger of evil while being guided by the wise magician, rogue pirates and various comic relief - all in space-setup setup. <br /> <br /> This is not to punish Lucas for using an old version. It's an old version precisely because it works. Fortunately, he gave her new tricks that made her very special. <br /> <br /> Then came the Empire and the story became more than a fictional story. The darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the best cinematic twists of all time. The Great Punk, Vander was the father of Luke. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I am convinced nor Lucas even appeared in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Find out what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, see if it really intertwined. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie - tremendous effects, lots of movement, and some good fighting scenes. But the film still lives or dies in his scheme - the story he tells. Oh, sure, really good work can save a weak plot, but a weak plot along with bad behavior - this burden can not be overcome by the director and certainly not as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas (the man has managed to steer some of the worst Presentations in their professional lives from some very impressive actors - Liam Nison, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Plot. Oh my. I understand, he's really handicapped by what happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible burden. There is much to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have enormous futility in the background. Anakin was found as a child in Tatooine, a product of birth of a miracle virgin - "chosen." Well, these details are not explained remotely. In fact, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that may have been wrong. Well Well. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, it turns out that this same wonder is the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And will return to the development and never know that it was from there? Wonderful! What about that. The old test wanting to suspend the disbelief there, er George? However, we have this terrible, moody, superior child, who is a young man, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema - the tragedy of the great Darth Vadore - the good man who falls from grace, to finally achieve redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> How do we pray, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die during childbirth. Now, of course, you live in a civilization that extends on stars and treats gravity like our dealings with gasoline, but does it happen to Dark Darkness to be able to verify the cause of a doctor perhaps, maybe perhaps, this future society can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think of is to kill some children because the bad man who is behind all the evils they are chasing for Vilmin tells him that he got the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course he does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to see this foolishness and move it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want to save this naughty or replace it in the first place. I wanted to kill Kenobi not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala finally died. In birth. why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a robot and himself, demonstrates the incredibly high technology offered to this society, offering only the conclusion "I have lost the will to live." Well, well, of course they do. Perhaps she finally woke up with what she was sleeping with. <br /> <br /> But here we are. Our Kenobi present all this. He knows the birth of Luke and Leah. He knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. The role of both R2 and C3PO is also known. However, in several years, while Luke approaches masculinity and shows up with 3PO and R2 (oddly, 3PO mind has been cleared, but not R2's - why ????) saying "I think these robots belong to you", Kenobi, who knows that The protocol protocol was created by a person who thought he was "chosen" and trained for the emperor himself, who happened to have been built on the same planet, saying "Strange, I do not remember owning any droids." <br /> <br /> Oh good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas simply made this as he progressed. Once Vader introduced Luke's father, unfortunately, the story began to spiral out of control because he did not know what the story was. Plot 1-3 loops are simply incomprehensible. Nothing in patin has made any sense at all. None of this is related to the story originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a late idea, and it seems so. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. It's a fun movie to watch, but you can forget it completely. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever. Thankfully, this one, and his two former ones, will soon fade.
