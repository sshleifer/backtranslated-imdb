I remember that I was going to watch the movie in the summer of 1978 with my father, and I was pretty at the time. Of course, I was seven years old. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movies, my wife and I hired this film because she never saw it and I was nostalgic. <br /> Ralph Beckshi has run out of money halfway through the animation process for this film, and has been forced to cut corners of this production dramatically. Since this film was originally made using rotoscoping, an animation technique for people with limited budgets, that says something. Much of this film is animated only in the narrowest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are obviously just people standing in front of the screen, with some moving effects that appear above them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the film - already pressed by the Fellowship of the Rings and part of the Two Towers - has been further reduced. What you get is somewhat like a striped version of Cliff Notes for books. <br /> <br /> Not everything is bad, although the animation brings warmth to it, which I found non-existent in Jackson movies. It's nice to imagine what it would be like to have adequate funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also referred to as complementary never came. Several years later, a private television program was broadcast for half an hour for half an hour, which was supposed to wrap things up. All I will say about this is that he was a musician.
