The story behind this movie is very interesting, and overall, the plot is not too bad ... but the details: writing, output, continuity, speed, sequence of motion, stunts, CG use are all the cheapest and spoiled movie. First, the sequence of events. They are all totally uninspired. Most consist of a person standing standing, not making any attempt to run or fight or evade or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. The sequences look nice to something created in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very good moving and moving effects, but it looks cheap because of how it is used. <br /> <br /> Speed: Everything happens very quickly. For example, "Elle" was trained to fight within two hours, from the outset it can fluctuate, and so on. Why is she so voluptuous? None of this is shown in the film. As Lilith, you do not need to be able to return flips - maybe you can not, because she has wings. <br /> <br /> Also, we have sequences like a woman running a car, waking up and wandering in a deserted room with a washbasin and a mirror, then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really interested in being exposed to a car The secondary effects of another car explode) ... "Are you okay?" She asks the driver, "Yes, I'm fine," she says, stained with blood and shaggy. <br /> <br /> I saw everything, though, because the intro promised me it would be fun ... but in the end, the bad execution made me wish anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even this movie with the vampires Jackie Chan was relieved because they were able to comment on my disapproval, but that made me just want to shake the director awake, and give the author a good new one.
