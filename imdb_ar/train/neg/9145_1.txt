Let me first mention that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's funny that some of these films leave more lasting impression than those really wonderful films. This film is bad in a malicious and disturbing way. This ambivalence of Sam Mraovich's phantasmagoria is not limited to unambiguous uncertainty; it redefines the meaning of words. This must be forever a measure of bad movies. Kind of Mendoza's line of film. Mr. Merovitz writes, directs, and stars as a sharp object Arthur Cyelis fights the burning wives and Christian evil forces while he and his partner Ben Mittan behind the eyes struggle for plates for marital equality. As a libertarian, I think homosexuals should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur hurts this issue more than the gay army. The portrayal of all the Christian things is very ugly and has a pork grip, the Mraovich brand, so you can not take any of them seriously. The brother of Arthur Victor, the Bible that sinned Jesus, is so wicked / gay that you have to wonder how he was thrown into this role. That's because Sam's "multitasking" was also a great way out. Worst of all is Sam Marovic himself. When you think of a leading man, do you remember the soft words, baldness, and chubby? Sam also offers lines like domino pizza and cold and is usually a mistake. Final Outcome: You absorb writing, direction, representation and casting. This is Ed Wood's quartet crown. Congratulations to you, you terrible little man.
