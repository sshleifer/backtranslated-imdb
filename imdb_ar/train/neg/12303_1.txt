This film is very bad, it's good - in a funny way unintentionally. I could not stop watching it, I was laughing too much! It's like a spoof to a romantic thriller, but it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays the role of Emily Wendell, the wife of the oppressed preacher who makes it difficult for Luke (Corey Sever), the mysterious mysterious wanderer we learn in the end; the only thing that Sifer is condemning is, though he acts badly! It's not worse than other actors. She feels that the actors have no idea that they are in a truly terrifying film; they play it directly. All about bad film: acting, script, love scenes, speed, twist plots, music selection. The weather scenes are very ridiculous - first the correction in the church, then the last words of Luke to Emily - I was laughing. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Luke has done a lot of weight and crunch in prison, and we see a lot of his bare trunk. Maybe this is the highlight of the film.
