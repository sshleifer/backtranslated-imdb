There is no around - this movie is terrible. I've seen Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu's old films, and I'm familiar with the characters and their serial origins, but they're still loved. Still, the genius of Peter Sellers shines with his portrayal of Leland Smith, with the echoes of sadness, tragedy and strength boil through a serene facade; it is an equally equal performance with Peter Cushing's portrayal of Van Helsing, Dracula. If the movie was in a more hilarious form like BUBBA HO-TEP by AVENGERS TV in 1960, this may be something special. If you've completed Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, it's something you need to see, but it's a reminder for someone else.
