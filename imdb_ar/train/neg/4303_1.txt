The previous comment made me write this. You say that Muslims are blond and that the Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this view can be made racist. Look, sweat is not something. I am blind colors. I look like Pierce Brosnan but I'm not Irish. So what can I add that I am not 100% Serbia, I have Austrian and Croat blood inside me, but what is the point? I'm a dark, half-dynasty? Is this true? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with such bad intent as Lantos (producer 9 and director is racist to me.) Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all the monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia.All in hell but that will not bring our dead relatives back I am proud of being a Serbia and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family.) This film does not show the suffering of Serbs or Croats inside Sarajevo, I bow down and call all innocent Muslim brothers or sisters or Cathos Lake or Orthodox, who were killed in this war.We have the misfortune and wrong humanity that does not help at all.It helps the Lantos to fill his pockets with more drowsiness, well!
