The easiest way to describe this movie is satire. The goal of spelling is very broad, from the US government to American companies. It is also not a scathing satire; it is a fucking film. <br /> <br /> Think of this film as a mix of KFC series, the airline series and the police, accomplished with a much lower budget and not as funny. I can see how this film is a satire for many scientific disaster films of the 1950s and 1960s. I think this film has a big impact on Tim Burton's attacks on Mars. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Giant genetically engineered tomatoes become "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. At first, there is coverage and then turn into a full war. <br /> <br /> The film features a series of characters and descriptions: Lewis "Fairchild" (clone of Lewis Lane), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (an FIA client who has not worked since Bay of Pigs) (Apparently he can only sign his name and attack New York), an incompetent congress, a shrewd marketing chief, the Mason team of obese East Germany female swimmers, Scuba diving, crazy paratroopers in World War II (Disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler, and finally Ktamatm). Have you also forgotten to mention lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of small tomatoes, from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to broken tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people wearing tomatos. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, you have a few musical numbers as well. It is not good and it seems to be called. The best tone is quite the subject of the film ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's a very attractive way and you may end up grumbling or singing in public places. be cerfull. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is very interesting and shows the absurdity of different real life situations as well as the different types of entertainment. I do not think I had to laugh, but most of them smiled and scratched my head. I would definitely recommend this movie to class B and C movie lovers, but only as a rent. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
