Fluffer may have strong elements for the fact that pornographic filmmaking is a reality - but this does not compensate for the fact that it is directed and acted in a very thin way - and with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Grade B is from beginning to end drawn too. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think of the audience's presentation of this piece as an example of the latest gay film making. <br /> <br /> We hope he has a limited life in the arena of film festivals, and allows him to die naturally on video. <br /> <br /> This movie will open this weekend in Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think its success will have a significant impact on the amount of alcohol consumed at the previous cocktail party - they will need it.
