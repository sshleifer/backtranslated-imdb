To be honest, I am amazed at the positive voices that this film has earned. The film lasts for a long time of 81 minutes, and the public has to suffer all the time. In fact there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives decent performance. We have been given some pathetic dialogue and are dealing with it well. On the other hand, Scott Valentine (a friend of Merrideth's in Family Ties) is a very rough hour. I think the most prominent thing in his performance is seeing the man who was lying on the beach wearing a tiger-style thief .... Give me a break. Also, Valentin gives us a terrible and pathetic picture of a vampire suffering from the loss of the day. (To see a much more convincing show than the suffering vampire, see Dennis Duff in "Bloodstorms: Subpesis 4"). The film moves very slowly and is interspersed with dance scenes by Charlie Spradling. Frankly I can recommend this movie only to Charlie Spradling's tough fans (who I am, and I still have a hard time!).
