Drew Barrymore plays the role of young Holly Gooding, who moves with aspiring screenwriter Patrick Haysmith (George Newburn) and completely disables his life by claiming that her "doppelganger", or twin villain, is out to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror film is hard to take seriously, even if filmmakers and actors seem serious. "Doppelganger" is chaotic, with some stupid dialogue unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that the name of Drew's character derives from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that Newbern's name is a play by the famous author Patricia Haysmith (actually trying to rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror film) , Believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I suppose he deserves some credit for not being worthy of the typical horror film - I mean, it seems that the writer / director Avi Nisher really cares about his characters, and gives his film a plot more than standard standard fare. <br /> <br /> - The confrontation between the audience, the film continues to offer a miserable climax out, must be ratified. Surely this film does not spare the bull. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills her mother in this. no I'm not joking. Jaid Barrymore appears near the beginning just to slay violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very taut and very sexy in this. Newburn comes as a kind of "gentle" men. But the highest point in the film must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, a very veteran and attractive professional in her former nun who started the sex trade by phone (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is mainly undesirable but somewhat entertaining on a small level of nonsense. <br /> <br /> 4/10
