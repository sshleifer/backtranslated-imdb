Warning! This review will reveal the end of Scoop. If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is very bad, you think "Annie Hall" was a fortune. <br /> <br /> She gets one star because you see Hugh Jackman naked. This is the only thing Scoop is doing. <br /> <br /> hatred of women from Woody Allen, and install it on young women, including enough, at this stage, to be his granddaughter, has hampered any ability to produce movies that it may have been at any time. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be promising: a ghost, Ian MacShane, directs a student named slave, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether the English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is the famous killer of prostitutes tarot card. Help the witch, Woody Allen, the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite a promising plot, the film lacks magic, humor, or air. It's an amazingly amazing effort for a person who made one previous film, and cares only about dozens. Alan may have suffered a stroke that has not been reported in the press. <br /> <br /> A lot has been made of the fact that unlike his previous films, the Woody Allen, who is now accompanied by a parasite, finally allowed a man of young males to do to get the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot was built in a way that does not allow the girl to do it. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene where Johansson, without a major reason in the film, allows herself to be drunk, and seduced, by a strong older manager. "Mutton" is an euphemism for what happens. It's "Slam, Pam, gotta go" kind of moment. Has nothing to do with the plot at all, and it cuts Johansson into the viewer's eye. Why did Allen add this unnecessary scene to the film? Because it shows a powerful way out - like Allen - fucks the female. Alan gets his cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson was not yet represented. She does not know how to control the screen except by wearing a low tight top. She imitates Allen in two scenes, and this seems strange and sad. <br /> <br /> does not help in writing the texts of her puppet can not function without a ghost or an elderly and less charming than stunning, telling her what needs to be done at every turn. <br /> <br /> She is about half the age of Jackman, and she is a very strong presence of a screen in their scenes together. <br /> <br /> worthy members of the public is Nerds better in breast Btalathm, Jackman deserves better too - a scenario gives the heroine some intelligence and the IAEA, and representative to convey those qualities can. <br /> <br /> Hugh is cheating similarly cheated by the script. It seems that Allen can not afford Jackman to have a strikingly young appearance, so he does not give Jackman what he says or does. Like Johansson, used only for its good appearance. This is a shame, because as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can act. <br /> <br /> Here's the twist of the big plot - Jackman, suave, the charming English Lord, is really a murderer. So, although the film says it's all about letting someone else, unlike Allen, get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man she loved, was the man who killed a prostitute. Nice, friendly. A nice way to punish a heroine for being behind your reach. <br /> <br /> In an aggressive touch negative, Allen denied the heroine of your existence, and kills his character, magician, and Scarlett Johansson leaves all alone at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last note: In my presentation, no audience laughed at any moment during the film. Always a bad sign when a comedy movie is announced.
