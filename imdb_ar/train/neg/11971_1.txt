Although the film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, it is best to skip this film. I watched this on television, so I did not have to pay for it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot develops very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are very reasonable, they become more and more unreasonable in the end. It is highly questionable, if an experienced soldier like Lieutenant Waters breaks direct orders. Even if he wants, the rest of his faction will do so. They know that he puts them at immediate risk, and they know they will surely die if they follow him, but what he sees is our lieutenant, so let us do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, there are some nice scenes in this film. They are saving a village to a certain extent, where the total population is slaughtered by the rebels. Well, they have saved dozens of villagers or so, and the rest have already been killed. The odd part of it, they took the trucks left behind by the rebels. They are rather walking on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation. In any case. I think this is what the film earned the point I gave to the film. <br /> <br /> What made this film an insult to the mind, and thus quite unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill many insurgents without hurting or killing themselves. Only near the end they lose some comrades. This is only because they have to fight an army of about 500 soldiers or more. do you believe that? <br /> <br /> They are fighting for an army that includes many of them, killing hundreds of them, and losing only a few of them. They have rounds and a round of ammunition. Never run out of it. Grenades, clay mines, M60 machine gun and even RPG. Where do these things come from? Carry it around or what? They even got a laptop that shows them the activity of the enemy rebels. This laptop contains a battery that lasts for several days. really? Who thinks of this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I think if you stop your mind completely and accept that the rebels represent a group of idiots, you give this film a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.
