A somewhat embarrassing spy puzzle with a predictable plot about the dangers of World War II. The puzzle is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) suffers from amnesia or not. The best work done by Raymond Massey as Dr Ingresol, a good doctor turned to evil. Is the head of the spy ring trying to get information from Jane's amnesia, encrypted information related to Allied activities. Would you say? Can you remember? Moroni Olson (Mr. Godwin) is persuasive as a partner in Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is no less catastrophic. It seems so bad that the film is rated as one of the worst in the film's history. It is unfortunate that the talented actor is stuffed into a role that does not suit his talents. The film deserves a single look, despite being a half-spy and half film gangster, although it contains a collection of stereotypes. Easy to forget this one, memory loss is not necessary.
