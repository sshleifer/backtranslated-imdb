At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photographs and the fox scenes were spectacular. However, the story was very slow and boring. Then the young girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the woods and often see foxes. One thing that anyone should know is to leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This film presents a terrible example of the children you will see, in an attempt to make a wild creature a violent animal. I do not know what the purpose of the story. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wanted to play with these groups. Did not she learn the lesson? Other scenes show predatory animals of the fox, increasing the trauma of the children watching the film. What a disappointment this movie was. What a terrible story to tell. The last conversation was very stupid, and at that time my wife and I were screaming on TV! I totally hated this film and would never recommend it!
