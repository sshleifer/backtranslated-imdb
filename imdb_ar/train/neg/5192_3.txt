It does not take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head does not appear in network tables. The TV documentary does not skip the appropriations before it becomes clear to what extent it will become bad. Maybe I missed something, because the plot was not logical. Based on what has gone awry, a terrorist, a thief or something called "Tree" (Ian MacShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something related to a secret weapon. The world's most wonderful secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thaines), will stop him. Maybe there was more, but trust me? It really does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Motion movies must have an effect. Suspicions must be a suspenseful suspense. The dramatic moments must have a drama. There is none of this in the name of the symbol: Diamond Head. I have seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this made for snooze TV? It is better than any single word description I can get out of it. None of the characters are at least as exciting or worthy of attention. Roy Thaines leads to the worst imaginable. His charisma is just a little north of the alloy. Ian McShane is the best thing the film can do, but unfortunately for all others concerned, he does not seem to be returning as a regular member of the film. Now if McShane is selected in the lead series, you might have something. <br /> <br /> I quickly found out that these terrifying Gawd movies made in the 1970s make wonderful Mystery Science Theater 3000. This doubles if Queen Martin is involved. Very funny things from Mike and Bots. So, while the movie was only given 3/10, I classify episode 608 on 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
