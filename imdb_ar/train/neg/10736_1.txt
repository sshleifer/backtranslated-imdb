The film begins with an intriguing scene, where three people drink and speak in a bar. Each of them makes some very ugly stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most disturbing story is true. However, the film is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation barely happens half the time in the film and frankly, there is not much left to see. The rest of the time the filmmaker is staying in God who abandoned a Russian village full of elderly and hereditary women. Of course, these images are wonderful and a little overwhelming, but admiring them goes on too long, sacrificing any potential plot or personal development. I have found this film as another example of poor or slow filmmaking. Instead of trying to make an interesting story, filmmakers focus on fantastic and strange images through a few irrelevant stories (eg, the story of a meat dealer) to let the viewer see all the odds And goals. On its surface a technical appearance, but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent.
