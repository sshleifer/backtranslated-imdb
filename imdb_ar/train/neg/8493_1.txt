After several days of seeing Conceiving Ada, I'm still afraid that any group of people will spend a lot of time producing such a terrible film. <br /> <br /> No one should see this movie in the hope of learning anything about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her endeavors. <br /> <br /> Similarly, no one should see this film in the hope that it will be absolute. <br /> <br /> As a science fiction film, this will undoubtedly be a terrible failure. In a way, the main character has been able to bring life back to the past and interact with it on its own PC - with the words of Timothy Leary's encouraging words. I doubt that anyone can comment not believing it enough to prevent this from appearing completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As a dramatic film, this will undoubtedly be a terrible failure. In one way or another, the writer / director can fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, unnecessary, nagging and trivial, on the basis of nothing. I doubt that anyone can feel that every drama in the film only leads to annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to express the full degree of disdain for Kony Adving. The circumstances I have seen prevent me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that I had otherwise. I am still angry at the wasted time it took to see him. Just because I might have criticized this film more effectively, I wish I were clearer.
