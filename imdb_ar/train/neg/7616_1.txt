The good news is that a film has been produced, based on the supposed Aztec myth, and includes an unnatural representative of the Aztec (there is such a word). The bad news is that she was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood stepped out of retirement and trained George Romero through his classic book "Night of the Living Dead," that's what we might bring with. "Diablo legend" is a clear feed to any future operations of "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> I do not think one can even label this movie "B". The production values ​​were so bad that I still felt like I was watching a long play from a varied show or an 8mm film shot by a group of school children. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers <br /> <br /> The basic plot line seemed interesting enough to attract me to rent it. California's rural workers find a box containing Aztec demon and inadvertently unleash it on the blind community. His daughters, one hot and one family, team up with a man from the FBI and a priest, try to reset the devil's cage. <br /> <br /> At the same time, every zombie scene seen by someone in previous movies is undone badly. These zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than undead! The supposed infrared sights from the devil's point of view are not something special? Surely he / she / she seems to back up a lot (instead of turning around to move forward). And the scene where the priest attracts Satan from the cave in a fast and ridiculous move! It really seems that it is done for comic effect - although I know it was not! I kept expecting Benny Hill to start appearing and for the entire zombie band to start chasing the priest on the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course Darth Vader's voice / field of dreams, where he contacted the FBI agent becomes a definite comedy. Then again, so most of this was a cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and screenwriter, must win something for this effort! (What about a black bowling game for life, like "Hollywood 10?") This rating, as I see now, was rated at 1.5. I'm afraid this is a decent boy! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsay Lovasu looks very hot as the youngest daughter of a dead client. Maybe that's why her big sister (Calvi Babun) escaped from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played the role of Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who participated in the Cincinnati Reds race? If so, the baseball must be stuck. In fact, they could not have done worse if they went to baseball and called it "Demons Abroad!" <br /> <br /> If you find out that this was really a project for the film community community college, you will issue apologies. This may be good enough for B or even B + as long as the gang returns to the camera in the college with one piece! The Blair Witch Project has proven that it can produce a film that is equally wonderful and mild. "The Legend of Diablo", however, does not seem to be a pair of shoes to work from! They were low budget, low talent, low everything. The very final scene - I mean in the last 10 seconds of the movie - is a creative or just moment of moderation. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have spent the hamburgers!
