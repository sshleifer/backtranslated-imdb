Scriptwriter Lisa Lutz began scriptwriting at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this piece of nonsense, she will get the prize of the most fortunate people ever. This movie never gets sucked ... It will never stop my surprise at turning into movies ... The fact that they made this writer Put it a bit? seriously? I can write a better crap than this in my sleep. <br /> <br /> Well, how many lines should I write? I do not understand this at all. I think I do not understand why there should be no limit to what anyone should say ... or Kuta? Seriously, I do not care if you have a single word sentence .. or even a single word response I mean, Come on? <br /> <br /> Thanks ... Is that enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is worthless.
