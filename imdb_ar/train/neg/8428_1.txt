Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high ratings, this is a terrible film. Horrible enough, I feel compelled to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film was recently set in the Raj state during the Indian struggle for independence. The following in the absurd plot fills me with infidelity only. What the characters do and how they behave just does not convince me that the characters are present in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, would a married Hindu maid from the local village have an affair with her English-educated husband, knowing that the discovery of this relationship would most likely mean social ostracism and shame if not the deadly punishment? It is unlikely, but probably still. However, will the same young Hindu maid, in the conservative society of India in that era, like Britney Spears almost naked in heat, continue to have hot outdoor sex during daylight in an open place where it can be detected at any moment? This is not only bloody, it is a backward line of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> These strange words coupled with bad acting prompted me to leave the cinema for an hour in the film, so I did not watch the second half. Of the film. One can only hope that the end will be smarter than I saw in the first half.
