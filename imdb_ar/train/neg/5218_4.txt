There are all the elements to spend a bad night in the movies: a dialogue full of technological vitality, chintzy groups, balsa wood representation, an amazing degree in the late 1980s, and a comprehensive look at anything on the Sci-Fi programming schedule, around 1993. Although "The Shift" starts with a lot of promise, the film is separated from the gentle muddle and cheese like the MST3K, while Clark Kent and Annabi "Dr." Peter Houseman (Jane LeBrook) are under pressure to release information about his covert projects. But when he experiences his own mysterious experience, he becomes a vaguely defined creature (carrying more than a passing resemblance to Dr. Freudstein's "House by the Cemetery"). FX works fairly well for this obviously low-budget production (although I doubt that most of it is kept in the shade for some reason), but overall, "transformation" leaves a bad taste in your gut, despite its hopes to influence us Unlike that. I can only agree with the concluding remark of one of the characters: "(It was) a nightmare ... from the past!"
