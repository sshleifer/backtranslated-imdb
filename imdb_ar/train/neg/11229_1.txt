They made me watch this at school and it was terrible. The film is old. The rings become confusing because reality is coupled with imagination to make the story more interesting. Teachers talked about it as a fun experience but in fact it was a painfully boring experience. I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them do what they do in the film in real life. This explains cheesy representation often. Also, the story often becomes somewhat heinous and elusive. I do not like the way I wrote some fonts and I wish it would have a bigger meaning for them. Although he was written to be educational, funny, disturbing and hip, it ended up being boring and distant and elusive. I hope nobody takes time to watch this movie because you will not be doing well.
