I can not believe that this vulgar and cliched piece with the words of a movie Clichy got it. There are about four good-looking clips (the director should think of switching to hard photography) and that's it. A whole set of actors is wasted, the scenes end repeatedly in the least interesting moments and the text does not refer to anything new. Please spare yourself this movie.
