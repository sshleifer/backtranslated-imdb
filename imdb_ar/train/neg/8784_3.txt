The idea was wonderful, the actors were amazing, the story was very scary, but the writing was bad and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel the characters, there was a lot of blasphemy, and the film ends very strangely. Was it a happy ending? I do not know, I do not know. Was it a sad end? Again, I do not know. I left the theater feeling dissatisfied. The film had a lot to give, but it could not. Just because you can modify, does not mean you should, right? I do not really recommend this movie because you can not say that you left the movie as if it was completed. You just have to be confused. Trust me, maybe you'll thank me if you do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
