You purchased this video at Walmart's $ 1 bin. I think I'm overpriced !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi produced a long series of third-rate films for small studios (in this case, Monogram - the ones that made most of Bowry Boys). While most of these films do not come close to the horror of his latest films (Ed Wood Classics like The Bride of the Beast and Plan 9 of Outer Space), they are poor films and must be avoided by everyone but most fanatically. In addition, a few of these films were actually really poor quality - not this film. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, another scientist, a crazy scientist who wants He kept his strange and violent wife alive through the blood serum, he uttered by the young brides, they never explained why they should be brides or why should they? Be a woman or even a disease that his wife suffered - so you can see that the plot never got rid of it at all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you want a really annoying reporter (Lewis Lynne Don Jamie Olsen or Superman) The bottom of all these apparent crimes from which the bodies were stolen, so follow some clues to the door of Lugosi, a complete Lugosian house with his crazy wife, his assistant and two strange people who seem to be the sons of the aides. It's natural that this lovable reporter flips over and over again throughout the film - and narcissism and good investigative journalism seem to go hand in hand! In the end, crazy people die - mostly because of their hands and everything is fine. In conclusion, the journalist and the doctor she just met decided to get married. Of course, the stupid reporter cameraman disappears when this happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was a slow and expansive film, they are just gone!
