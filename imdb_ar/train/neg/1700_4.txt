In the film, I feel as if it should be more than just an art. I think it should be more, a way to tell a story on the screen. This short story from David Lynch tells a story but not many of them. I felt it was funny but strange to be a comedy. It's a good film industry but there's nothing else for it. As I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch but I'm frustrated by some of his work because I do not see a need for it at all. This is certainly my least favorite thing yet, but I know that he still has a lot of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you love Lynch, check it out but do not be surprised when you do not like it very much.
