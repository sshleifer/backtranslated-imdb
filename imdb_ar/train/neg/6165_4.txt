Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - the usual mature middle-class types that appear in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to entertain in the comedy comedy Woody Allen, but here it is perfectly located on his face. Even the hardliners have deserted him. In fact it is not a conspiracy (cutting bars and pieces of Shakespeare cod) - but Allen seems to use the site to allow semi-mystical air, which makes it smarter and half baked. <br /> <br /> It does not work at any level and is just a giant. The best thing about this film (apart from the final credits) is that bad reviews seem to make it wake up and realize that just putting a bright script and throwing your colleagues into it does not make them entertain.
