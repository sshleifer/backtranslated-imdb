I must say I am somewhat disappointed by this horror film. I did not feel afraid even once while watching it. It's also not disgusting too ... I've been able to guess the end of the road through the film ... so .. what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Episode" is a very scary movie. I hope other films stop copying (like brand: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie.
