After having decided to collect Billy Bob Thornton movies for a while (about the strength of classics like "Sling Blade", "Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Was not There" among other films), it was inevitable that there would be an exotic Turkey there . What I did not realize was that there could be this bad. I'll give you an idea of ​​how unbelievably weak this film is - it seems to be the most debilitating part of it, like Knock Knock, Who Is It There? , "The Smelly Man", "The big stinking man who?" , "Big stinking man - you!". Yes people, is really so bad. Billy Bob is there for only two minutes (I think he needed to work at that time in his career), and the rest of the film is painful. For some reason, though it is undeniably awful, I do not hate it. This is probably because I saved my anger from any high budget, junk special effects like "fast and furious" and not "no budget" like this one flick. 2/10 in batch.
