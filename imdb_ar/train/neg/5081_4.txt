Was there a positive one for this film? Critics who know nothing about video games can discover the mistakes of committed games. There is no apparent damage caused by visible damage from the outset as a fundamental example. <br /> <br /> I missed something, but it was not Super Mario Bros. 3 assumes that the game has not played before? Well, if that's the case, I did not miss anything ... How did you know Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, so much about the game already? We're talking about things that some people do not know about through second or third play. <br /> <br /> Beyond the real mistakes and games, there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is frankly memorable. The child was not good at playing video games in the footage they showed. Many of the children I knew in those days were more experienced. Moreover, representation and story are only modest in their strongest points. The characters are nice and imperfect, the "magician" (the youngest child) is a clich√© a silent child and quite dry for a small child who never speaks because of trauma. Not that this is unrealistic, it is a fact that it should have been thrown into the film until it actually begins to form a plot of land that may last up to 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of the nature of nostalgia. If you come up with this movie, you'll like it, whether it's good or not. It was about children playing video games, and while I saw him, you probably had an obsession with NES as well. But unless you love her as a child, there will be nothing to keep you interested, and very little will stop you from stopping him. <br /> <br /> No sir, I did not like it.
