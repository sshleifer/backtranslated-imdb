Kind of clouds by erotic scenes, just to realize that this was one of the most amateurish and unreasonable film parts I have ever seen. Kind of like a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what was with all the stock figures in that supposed alien city in the Midwest? It's very hard to get involved with this one. There are no lessons to be learned from, there are no great insights, just opaque and ridiculous (but a lot of skin, if that interests you) a nonsense video ... What happened with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the encounters between the sexes. And what was with this ridiculous dance, where everyone plays their stereotypical roles? Give this pass, it's like millions of miles of bad and wasteful movies, and the money that could have been spent on starving children or AIDS in Africa .....
