This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they have forgotten how to act. I was hoping that the film would improve as it progressed, but the acting was very robotically and was fateful from the start. In fact, it seems that representatives may have been reading from a script all the time. Maybe it was the musical result or the director himself, but one thing is certain the makeup artist needs to get another job! The face powder was so thick that you could see it smeared with faces! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never reached the theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods Shame on you guys for not giving you everything. The plot was great just need a whole lot.
