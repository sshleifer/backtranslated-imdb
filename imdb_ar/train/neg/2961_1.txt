I was having a baby sitting for a family of three young children for a night and their mother gave me this to show them that they had grabbed him at Wal-Mart earlier this week. The three children had a physical illness while watching. I'm sure it was the pizza they ate, or anything they all picked up from school, but it was possible to have this movie. Totally disgusting. How can anyone produce this caliber of garbage out of my will. Fortunately, the film closed when she noticed that the children were not responding and behaving strangely. For any parents there, I strongly advise you to refrain from allowing young children to watch this movie.
