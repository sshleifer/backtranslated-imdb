Dear, this movie was bad for various reasons. I was expecting to see a very low grade for this film and I was very surprised by the overall score. Once you skip one shot / stunt of black and white movies, which was a great idea, the movie continues, even at a run time of only 66 minutes. The sequence of credits at the beginning was very troublesome! In the truck, men suffer from a flat tire and change the steering wheel, which is necessary in the story! How slow are men in chasing and have already managed to hit Campbell ?? They did not seem bothered to continue chasing him ... sigh .. I'm just very happy because I got this for free with a special version of Evil Dead !!
