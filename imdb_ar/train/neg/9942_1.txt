At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and ate corn pop as loud as possible to drown the inferior dialogue. This is definitely not a girl movie. No shouts of admiration, are the ones that we ladies can make sure to stay away from. A stupid story, mediocre dialogue and a cheap film overall appearance. I have seen many films, but this movie is the new winner in a bad category. If it happens to see him, the only thing you will look forward to is the end. So you can finally run out of theater as fast as you can.
