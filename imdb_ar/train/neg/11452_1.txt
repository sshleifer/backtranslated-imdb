If I can rate this movie by 0 I'll be! I see that some ppl in IMDb says that this is the craziest movie of the year, etc. Excuse me? Is Ppl Snoring LSD or ........? There's nothing funny at all about this movie N O T H I N G! I really want to re-27 minutes of my life that I spent watching this piece of nonsense. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie stop watching after 30 minutes, and I fully understand that I was actually watching snakes on a plane twice instead of watching this one time movie! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, or do something else useful in your life, you can do dishes, walk the dog, hell ... anything better than spending time in front of the TV watching a hot rod.
