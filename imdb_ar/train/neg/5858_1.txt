This was allocated to the public as the "winner takes everything" has happened between two separate companies (WWW and the "Alliance": the merger of former stars in WCW and ECW.) Because the final match was a match between the two teams, the wrestlers were trapped The opponents are from each side of the ring to the other; each wrestler concludes that in order to weaken their opponents and intensify the match, the intervention is necessary, each wrestler collapses on the opponent punches, the execution of a special step, signs in the partner, "Allans" would be reckless and join the WWF The WWF will generally be: a very innovative story but poorly implemented, and it is not the scarcity of wrestlers because match coordination is a team, and the remaining games are just a rebellion: <br /> <br /> Edge vs. T est: "Big Boot" by Test, but this did not show the real talents of both stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow Vers Christian: Good match but great for pay per view <br /> Taji vs. William Regal : The worst game of the night <br /> <br /> Immunity Battle Royal: This was an amazingly fun game to watch, but because the main stars of both companies participated in the main event, just a wrestler Characteristically shown on "Heat" WCW may be light-weight rejected (ie Hurricane employed only as an artist) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boys vs Dudley Boys: Best match at night: Jeff Hardy executed a "Swanton bomb" from the top Cage and across a wooden table Matt was tied in the cage, which looked very painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was the WWF Champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion, and Kurt Angle was the alliance's mole, all the main stars in the main event on the Alliance faction were awarded the action after the match, Except Booker T, who recently attacked a wrestler on "Raw" and will be given an inevitable act. Sean McMahon will return to the television in one way or another, and everyone wants to see the fall of the "coalition" and his conclusion to see Stone Cold out of action. WWF has done much better. The game in which all the melts were brought to one faction was better, and what had ever become in Casket and Iron Man?
