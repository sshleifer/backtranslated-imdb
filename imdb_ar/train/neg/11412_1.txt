This movie is very bad, you can not imagine it. Representation is terrible, even worse than in third-rate serials. It is a shame that this film has been the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers were not logical at all. The story could have been taken out of Bravo's story, and the wooden dialogues were like Treebeard and the holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But at the moment there is little need to satisfy the public. The handsome actors were eg Miss Switzerland and the previous main character was so outstanding (woah !!) and certainly there was a lot of drug abuse. This is a real wonderful guy! Especially for young people aged 12 and 13 years. But the media created a charming atmosphere in that you were not allowed to reject the film because they treated the dynamics of the peer group by implicitly telling them that you are a nerd if you do not agree with other "sheep" and say. Yes, that's exactly what it was like when I was in the army. That's exactly what I'll do when I have to go to the army. Every cheesy action has to do with drugs and calm. I do not think I love the army. I was there and I hated him, but this film is worse than cleaning the toilet with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I was infatuated). It does not have to be a sophisticated film. Sometimes you just want to enjoy a few hours and forget the problems and I think it's not bad. But this type of film affects teenagers to a great extent by showing them a wonderful lifestyle and is really just stupid and turns them into stupid and selfish fools. But since my mind is not very common now, I will be quiet now and I advise you to avoid this terrible thing at all costs and to save your intelligence! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry my bad english)
