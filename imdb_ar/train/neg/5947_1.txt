This is one of the most abhorrent and cruel films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was duped into sticking to it, because the presence of Donald Sutherland gave her some credibility in a misleading way. [This is the last time it will happen.] <br /> <br /> The character of Leslie Ann Warren was very annoying and stupid when she came. There were more intelligent characters than her salary who were killed in the film. This is just one of the many things in this film that made me ask, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the cable filled up late with a sadistic litter filled with pathological mess? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on being intimidated and killed. This movie could have been all disgusting without Willow getting sick in the process. All that comes to end is the heart of the viewer's illness, insulting the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The cast is misleadingly good. I think they ridiculed Sutherland first, and used it to attract others like rodents in this. <br /> <br /> I kick myself to waste time, and I give this piece of garbage a chance.
