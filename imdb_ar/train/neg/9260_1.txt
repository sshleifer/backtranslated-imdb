The only connection to this film with horror is that it is not frighteningly scary. Better prick my finger with a rusty nail instead of sitting again. Even for a television film it is flat. Cast boring. Scenario as exciting as a pot of sand. How two filmmakers conspired to create such a film would remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene that deserves even mystery in the Omen franchise, and is filmed in slo-mo and is limited to the expected salary. If you're tempted to see it, open it, set the alarm for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With luck, you will fall asleep quickly, and the alarm will alert you once the worst is over. This is the film.
