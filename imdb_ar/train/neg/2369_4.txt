A sixth escape to Freddie Kruger, where he finally managed to kill almost all the young people in Springwood; now he wants to expand his horizons and needs a family member to do it. <br /> <br /> Failure as a horror film simply because it is not scary at all. It works better than a dark, terrifying black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger is now stripped of all his power to cool this scene. (Many things, that's for sure.) The actors are not happy (with the exception of Robert Englund, as always, obviously Yafet Koto) and there are too many visual effects. The end is fine but does not provide as many sparks as one might think. <br /> <br /> In adding a new touch to the familiar dream killer story, Englund provides the opportunity to make more make-up scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There is a prominent veil worth noting: a common veil between the couple then Rozan and Tom Arnold is devoid of entertainment value, and a suitable appearance by veteran rocker Alice Alice Cooper, and a funny veil of Johnny Depp also recognizes the pop icon that has become on her. <br /> <br /> Premiere Breckin Meyer plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is that it reruns the main scenes from the previous entries during closing balances. <br /> <br /> 4/10
