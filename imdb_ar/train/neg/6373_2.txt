Hey this was a really bad film. The girl who plays the role of Jennifer is fine, but I think she behaves in a confused way through the film, not because she rushes her organs by a crow at night, but because she thinks of separating her agent from putting them in a piece of this waste. Fay Dunaway behaves as if she is reshaping Mommy Dearest and the ending is completely silly. I really can not recommend this film even though I admire Edgar Allan Bo, I was very impressed by the references to his work (Ravens, a family-like curse of House of Usher, buried me alive) - he may still be turning in his grave if he knows about this film.
