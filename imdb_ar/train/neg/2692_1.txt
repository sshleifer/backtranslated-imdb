Nacho Figalondo is very famous in Spain. It's a kind of bad guy who can make you feel sick ... very embarrassing. Nacho did some commercials on TV, and I remember an ad that was Nacho looking for Paul Mc Carney about Madrid (it was about Mc Carney CD). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like the commercial Nashu commercial: a bad story, a bad guide, and horrific performances. I can not believe that such a disgusting movie was at the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho was able to make this film because of his wife, producer of this 7:35, a woman well connected with Spanish TV entrepreneurs.
