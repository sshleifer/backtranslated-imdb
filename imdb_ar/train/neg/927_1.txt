I mean really, how could Charles Band, head of Full Moon leave a foul ball just like DEMONICUS. I mean it should never get green light. The story is frequent, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranus, then he is a bad man. Then they leave the writer or director towards the bad end. That's a bad end, Demonicus rises. The last survivor escapes from a deadly cave, then shows a picture of Chimera, has it cheaper and expels it cheaply. Then as they walk home Ala FUNHOUSE. The statue, which has been destroyed for several centuries, reappears for no reason to collapse above it. This means no sense. What Charles was thinking of the hell was to let this noisy pile be made, with four different film companies desperate for the movies. They could have asked me, I had better ideas then DEMONICUS. Thank you Turkey.
