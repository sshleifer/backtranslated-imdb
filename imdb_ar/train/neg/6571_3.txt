Although I disagree completely with one of the reviewers who described Charlie Chase as unusual, he certainly is in this film. It's shameful, because I think the other reviewer should have seen only a few Charlie Chase men, and I suppose the guy was not funny. Movies like the mighty like Moss and what is the price of GOOFY? Chase movies are very good, so it can be really funny due to good material. Unfortunately, in this film did not give anything at all. Even the good inclusion of Oliver Hardy as a chip is not helpful because the basic premise (the boy wants to marry a girl but the girl's father thinks the boy is weak) and the depression is very poor. It's a shame, I really wanted to love this movie but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who are used to looking for Charlie from the mid-twenties onward, you will be very surprised as the Chase sports no glasses or mustache - and looks very little as you would expect.
