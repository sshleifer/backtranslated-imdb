The weak relationship between this film and the first grease is established at the beginning of the film when Didi Conne, one of the four trained members, repeats their roles with a young Maxwell Coffield, a British exchange student. Although the style of external speech of Olivia Newton St. John is not explained in the previous film, it is shown here that Caulfield is her cousin. What still Kun does at school, I think she likes hanging around Rydell High even though she is now a beauty expert. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a clever child, so of course the kinds of hoods led by Adrian Zamed described him as a nerd. This is particularly bad when a friend of a Zmed girl decides she likes Cullfield. But as a nerd, you will not cut it. <br /> <br /> This is the time when Cullfield decides to put Zorro in modern times. He gets an annoying bike and puts it together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a biker driver with a set of goggles to hide his face. If you do not get a Michelle Pfeiffer card in the cards, Cullfield will not have any trouble making friends in any gay men's leather strap. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Colefield and started running them. I enjoyed both successful career paths. If you see Grease I, which is a much better film, you certainly have an idea of ​​how this movie will appear. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all of the faculty members of the original grease return in their roles. The musical result is not as good a distance as the songs that come from the original. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 is not bad, it's not quite good.
