Because some people, like me, like to know everything about a movie even if they are planning to watch it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end as I remember, because I was not more than 8 years old when I first saw her on television. But I'll tell you, she certainly frightened the little boy I was in, and I thought about it for days afterward, and it's still in my mind to this day, although some details are a bit vague. Was my father Vigoda in this film? I do not remember it! I did not remember that Ol 'Barnabus was in this movie, and I love Dark Shadows. In the end, the leading personality (Belinda Montgomery?) Is tempted by the judge (Joseph Coton, I suspect that although I remember that he was an old family doctor or something rather than a judge; see how memory fades?) To the place of the wedding, Cave of some kind? Shellie Winters laughs there, the judge wears up, the camera angle of the kind he looks at as he throws a mantle, has goat legs, and declares that in fact her father, the devil, has played properly in their hands (Satan's worship), because The "fatal" man who fell in love with him (I think this is Robert Foxworth) also shows that he is the man who Satan wants to marry her, the devil with yellow eyes, yes, certainly, they show Robert Foxworth, his eyes yellow in color. There are a lot of confidants in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone laughs and cheers, except for Belinda Montgomery, she is so happy, crying or yelling or something, and this is the end. The bad guys win.
