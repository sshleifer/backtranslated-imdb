I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the film I was very disappointed. First of all, Deborah did not respect Ravin but she was very mature to play with a 24/25 woman. The late Christopher Reeve was also the same reason. According to the book, he was about 30 years old. I would like to see more exploration of his military life, the trip of his friend Reid, to me, to see him because that was an important part of the development of the story of the characters. Miss Bisley was also wrong to mention the book as a plus. I know that the film did not have a budget "Bridges of Madison County" which I think was released almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this film was so bad and low in budget. As one of them said, I hope that Ms. Spencer will retire and write scenarios for her books as they should be. She knows her character better than anyone else, and I hope you think about doing it too. The movie let me down!
