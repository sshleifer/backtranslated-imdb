Not really spoiled in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, however. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants to ignore the many absurd audiences of his character in 10 elements or less, a film of a deliberate creative nature, absorbed only in his teacher / to be all you can. - Subject. He plays an alternative world, a semi-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, whose driver drove an old Ekonovan on his way to Carson, California from Brentwood to look for his next film role. Why Carson, a mystery for all the inhabitants. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. It is good to see Paz Vega, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, where he plays the disgruntled grocery storekeeper in a large but slow local market and seems to be the ultimate source of Moragan Freeman's research. His character is known only as "he" in referring to how actors are perceived when confronted in real life by ordinary people - "Psst, this is", etc. Unfortunately, I was very distracted that he had all kinds of mundane wisdom and advice but did not have a reliable return to his home in Brentwood, did not carry any cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him, and if one of those people had a high opinion In themselves that they believe they have the answer to everything like him, then I will see the criticism and BlackBerry that displays the instincts of intelligence and good survival to keep this great ego that he certainly possesses. Nothing really happened in this film. I did not think any of the main characters was great. They changed as a result of their meeting with each other, and they condoned the idea of ​​adultery, but then the thought faded. This was for me a shop resembling Steve Martin, without a sexual relationship. He was tolerant of Freeman and was not convincing to the public .
