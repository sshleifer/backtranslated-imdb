I remember watching the movie "Lost Missile" (which is doing well so that my brother and many of my cousins ​​whom I was a guest at home came to see with me - I was, from time to time, Eric Cartman in the sixties - sorry, guys) and being embarrassed to Somehow when the constant wave of one million degrees of temperature emerged as a conspiracy tool - even if I were a second-grade student, I knew that a rocket could not afford the heat or destruction for more than half the time of the nuclear explosion. <br /> <br /> Turkey's rhythm with loving relatives was a crime of self-punishment. <br /> <br /> The film's production values ​​were very good. The acting is not bad (apart from smashing the actor who played the role of assistant governor mentioned by someone else here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​an easy-to-bread missile on the surface of the earth by the heat of its exhausts ... no. <br /> <br /> How will people in the "Mysterious Science Theater 3000" be absent from the "Missile Missile", anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic game of unintended comedy - watch it if you want to drink beer on the weekend.
