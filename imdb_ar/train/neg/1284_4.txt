This film was a long accumulation without a peak. People who refer to swordfight must ultimately be great either from their minds, or have nothing. This film often became soft. I'm not saying that bad movies are bad. But no matter how fond of sugar, it should not have room for a T-bone steak. This film was supposed to be about retaliation for crimes against a culture, but it ended up being a small fight. There was only one of them who already knew how the sword was; character Tim Roth (and yes, he plays well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" and did not know how to use the sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. As a drama, this film had periods, but its best performance should address the nature of Scotland. This is one boy less than described as "soap" in my book.
