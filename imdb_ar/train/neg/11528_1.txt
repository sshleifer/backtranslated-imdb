Anyone who wrote the "gentle" publication about this should be a friend of these men. This is bad even for backyard wrestling. In fact, this is not really a backyard wrestling, it's a few players bumping into each other on the trampoline. All the players are about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. It's just a few children who are bored so they call the patios a bad name, if possible. If you want to see some amusing backyard wrestling, choose Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. Stars 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh ban. These guys are good. They have already gone since and received professional training as "real" professional wrestlers. They went legitimately and improved. I recommend checking out these 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and out of the hook. So do not waste your time or money on crappy DVD, there are "better" videos in the backyard there.
