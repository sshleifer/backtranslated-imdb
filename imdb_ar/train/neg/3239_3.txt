Ah, the notorious "Guinea Pig" series ... I frankly must say I was disappointed as a whole of the whole series ("never die", "mermaid in the inspection slot", "flesh flower" and blood " Is the exceptions ... and even those are not great by any means ...), but the "devil experience" is just a clear blow.There is nothing realistic happening here, other than the climate scene (or perhaps anti-climate, depending on how you see it) It seems that the victim does not really care about what is going on and rarely gets whines or starches while being subjected to "ugly" torture (often "joyous"). "I salute the Japanese for pushing the border, and they have come a long way in the last two decades to wear the crown in the making of" extreme "films, but the" devil's experience "does not hold up. Look if you are nervous, if there is no other reason but to know what the noise is about, but I can only give this film a big vine 3/10 and this is just for the eye ...
