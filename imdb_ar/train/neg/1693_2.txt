My husband and I went to see this film, we became horror film fans who we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting to recover my money and time. I was very disappointed. Contenders for this film mainly contain the best movie points. There was nothing too scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found that most of the "scary" parts are more comic than anything else. After watching other films based on the work of the Japanese writers, I must conclude that what frightens in Japan is not frightening here in the United States. My advice: If you're a fan of real horror movies, save yourself from the pain of sitting in this movie. I can not really say that I would recommend renting it too, unless you have a free rental coming to you.
