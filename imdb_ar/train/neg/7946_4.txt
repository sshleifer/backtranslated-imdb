One boring word. <br /> <br /> The young Demi looks good, but she is pregnant (- so point = D) The movie is not scary at all ... <br /> <br /> The first scenes looked a bit crappy, and I could make the clouds better with Laptop, after effects. But it was then ... Now it is now. Some movies do not get well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> Not worth leasing or buying ... Get something better instead like an exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> Next = D <br /> <br /> Hey, the dramas are just starting out and simply suxor = D
