Kojak meets the Mafia. Tally Savales is one of those men of the past who seems to be largely forgotten. I never thought his program was fantastic. This is his characterization of the only dimension of the crime manager, with highly predictable results. If you chase the car and ride the car in general, there is not much development or work. I find the Mafia films dim because I do not respect any ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, in this case, Italian cinema, treated these men as heroes. I have watched the film and in a few days I will not remember much about it. Too much shooting, innocent passersby die, betray, this loyalty patients. The film was filmed well and decent representation. But the dubbing is very bad (because of the sounds I could not get out of those bodies), so much so that I started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
