I must admit I caught this up several times on the USA network. There is something about the absolute stupidity of this thing that makes me want to see it whenever it is. Yes, you are right in substandard acting, a plot that can only be seven years old, etc. But I can not feel sympathy for some actors. Then again, a few of these actors signed up for a more horrific sequel.
