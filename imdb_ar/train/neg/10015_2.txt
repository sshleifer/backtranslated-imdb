Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical teenager from the 1950s in Trouble Movie. It is not a horror film or science fiction. Plot is related to a group of teens who are about to be kicked out of their club "hot rod" because they can not meet the rent. Once expelled, they decided to try an old haunted house. The only saving grace of the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature suit) turns out to be the monster of an out-of-action film by Blaisdell.
