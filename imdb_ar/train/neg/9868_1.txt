I never commented on movies, but I saw the five glowing comments of this "film" and decided that I had to review my own assessment. My coach received this film in the mail, mixed with AMPAS, also known as the men who vote for the Oscars. I was so impressed by the way this film was built that it made it in our classroom to show us how we do not collect a film . <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain any plot, the scenes are terrifying and terrifying ((often using image techniques within the "24" fu style), and performances (especially leadership, which fail to act as bad actress) I have not known myself or the rest of the chapter what this film should have been about. The opening, which committed a kind of murder, and now that I thought about it, it was supposed to be a flash, forward, with the rest of the film being male Yat, but it is divided into that scene directly to the next without any reference as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I can really continue, at least, this film gives me renewed confidence in my ability to make films.
