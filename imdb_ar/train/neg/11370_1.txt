This video contains a strange way to confuse Americans and manipulate them around Islam. It is unfortunate that the people who did so really believe that the American people are too stupid to believe in him, perhaps, as an American citizen, everyone must protest against this kind of nonsense. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... The Koran is public! You can read it yourself and decide whether to say it's right or wrong ... <br /> <br /> The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies to address and relate to unrelated objects. The music used in some points prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what is going on there. They use images that are not erased from their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment I want to make ... Do not you think you can do exactly the same movie with every religion in the world?
