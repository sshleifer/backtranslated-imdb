Stuart Moss plays the role of a scientist on a business trip with his wife, and one feels he has been chosen for this role for his ability to regain his eyes in his head ... Imagine the tests for this .. "Can you ... no, that's not so, thank you, next!" . Anyway, bites bites, then turns into a kind of bat objects and kills people or .... it is not. No one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think he is changing because his wedding ring is on the surface when his hands turn into claws, etc. The credit is that the film waits if it is just a nut or it actually turns into something Almost to the end. This has some good sites and some kind of decent atmosphere at times, but unfortunately, none of them can compensate for a rather lame story and a terrible misrepresentation. Kind of fun in a way "very bad it's good", but more inclined towards just bad. 4 of 10.
