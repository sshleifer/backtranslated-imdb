I love the animation shows. I enjoy Nick's fare pretty much, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a TV program to the big screen is not easy, and it was not big enough. It was like a long episode of the show, and it did not move well. By judging the behavior of the children who were with us, it did not register well with them either.
