A completely unpredictable fucking show about a man who killed his wife by cutting her while driving and claimed to be blackout. Why was he still driving a car? Why does he still feel able to drive a car after his wife is killed by one? This question did not happen to the book. After that, the story talks about a psychiatrist and her failed marriage, which is linked to the failure of a driver marriage blackout kills the wife. The omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure, all of which accumulate to a predictable end and crash. Are psychologists in the police so easy? Deadly writing that actors do their best, but are doomed to failure. This is on par with Harlequin romance. Do not waste your time watching this one unless you're aiming.
