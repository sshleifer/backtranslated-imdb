This "movie" is a farce. No, wait - abomination. No, wait - this is by far the absolute worst film made by pet characters created and founded by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) instead of Peter Sellers was funny and funny, but even dares to "reshape" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is Azin and full of money. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy, respectively, have died since 1957 and 1965. Why does anyone begin to imagine that the appropriate updates to L & H will be in the personalities of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain. I expected to feel horrified and embarrassed, and certainly I was not disappointed. Anyone involved in this shameful, pathetic and pathetic act must do anything and everything related to Hollywood and filmmaking. Avoid this movie at all costs - you've been warned.
