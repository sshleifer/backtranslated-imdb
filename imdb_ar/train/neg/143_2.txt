In an attempt to retrieve the slanted kind of teenagers you snatched up like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what she did last Friday, Valentine failed. Why do people love Halloween? Because it was original and new and surpassed anything that was ever implemented. Why do they like yelling? Because at least it makes sense. Valentine's Day is just a stupid oblique flick that hardly has anything at all. The plot is very similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who he is, it's just a predictable sssssssssssooooooooooo. The teen type teenager is DEAD skip it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
