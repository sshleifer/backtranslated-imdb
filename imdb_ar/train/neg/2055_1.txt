There is no reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original said everything is still standing. Either read the book or do some research on the story, and you'll realize that this new release is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Berry Smith? His sister could have done better! Since Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the groups and sites do not look like Kansas. The original is the installation, from the imaging site to the actual participants use weapons and property victims. Unforgettable offers from Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. The soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall ... Original available on DVD in widescreen now. Let this Turkey die quickly.
