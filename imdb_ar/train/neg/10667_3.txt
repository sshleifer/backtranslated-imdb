Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just extra glorification for. Their scenes may have been filmed in a day or so. Whatever their motives for being in this film, if you have a representative like James Woods, it is better for you to take advantage of it. For me this is a sign of a bad direction through and across. The plot itself was not so bad. The representation of most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. However it was terrible. It was so incredible that I laughed at his dramatic scenes. Since this was meant as a serious film it could not be a good thing. The scenes were not bad, but they lacked that special punch to make them more exciting. Again the best direction was needed. Also it was wrong to film like this. It took the main character nearly half an hour to start working. For a 90 minute thriller just be very slow. The only recovery factor is Angie Harmon. She is doing her best to make everything work. Too bad the director left her hanging. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great outlet. Andy Cheng is very inexperienced as a director to drag him. For the game / game coordinator, you expect more exciting action scenes at least. Do not waste your time with this one. Avoid!
