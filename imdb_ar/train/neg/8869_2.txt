With the release of "Farligt f√∂rflutet", the Swedish film industry has achieved great success. Stephan (Jens Holten) has lived a quiet life with his wife Mary (Regina Lund) over the past years. One day, an old friend of Stefan arrives gently to ask him. Stefan is doing a small courier job. He is supposed to bring a bag full of heroine through the German-Swedish customs. Unfortunately, things do not work out in Germany as planned, and Stephan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish movie breaking the traditional family drama style. Unfortunately, if people involved in production have no idea how to write, film or cut the film, the result would be disastrous. Content can be concluded with: bad representation, incoherent plot and stupid dialogues. The highlight of the film is the unwarranted sex scene with incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts for only a few seconds and leaves about 90 minutes of purity, let's say what it really is, nonsense.
