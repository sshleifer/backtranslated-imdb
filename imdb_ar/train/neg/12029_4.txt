In general, I found that if you did not hear about a movie before watching it on a DVD, there might be a good reason for it. I never heard of this film until I was in Blockbuster the other day and saw it on the shelf. Since all the good films have already been rented (which I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I would make this one shot. <br /> <br /> It really is not much different from other films in genre, such as The Singles Ward or RM If you are in these films, you are likely to enjoy this. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not Murmona, you probably will not like this movie. There is no way to avoid the clear Mormon religious message contained in the letter, and sometimes the message appears na√Øve and cheesy. In the end, if you do not fall into the Mormon demographic, you'd better see something else. <br /> <br /> Admittedly there are some funny moments in the film, but I did not think that was enough to save the film in general.
