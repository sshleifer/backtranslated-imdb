Well, I saw this movie yesterday - unfortunately - worse than you can imagine. First of all, the plot is vile, and has no meaning at all. Scenario is full of deliberately funny dialogues. The audience was laughing several times. The suspense is very low. Actors play what in it, except Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some bad acting moments. The most sad parts are when you try to be very exciting and say things like, "I want to hear a voice of you." And so it seems, let's say so gently, a very mature woman acting rudely and not exciting at all. This erotic tension of BI1 went completely. Technically for Basic Instinct 2, the film is mediocre - better than the normal model directly to the DVD, but on a much lower lever than the original movie. For example the scene of the madness of joy is done badly. Instinct 2 manager is not Paul Verhoeff shows that. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his performances. The script is executed by people who do not match Joe Aztiras. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The film seems cheap and sometimes poorly edited. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why did not they make this film earlier and with the original talent behind the success of the first film?" All on the original film is similar to Citizen Kane compared to this. Basic Basic's first instinct is a classic game and a kind of penetration into popular cinema. It was exciting, sexy and controversial. She had the best performance for Sharon Stone in her career. She had Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately, Basic Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny movie and a bad output and certainly a Razzie award in many categories. It is a pity that they made this film.
