This romantic comedy is not too bad. There are some funny things happening here and there, and there are some memorable personalities. <br /> <br /> However, the representation is amateur (except banker). While some scenes are great fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found that the "romantic" part of the story is lousy. <br /> <br /> In general, I think we should see if you love football and romantic comedy. It was not a really bad film, and the end was very good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. Just enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
