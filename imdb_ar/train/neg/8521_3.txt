This does not give some plot, by the way. Christmas Charlie Brown is one of those timeless classic that teaches you the value of Christmas and just enjoy a holiday. This, however, does not. Trying to catch the Christmas feelings of Charlie Brown, there is even another Christmas game, but they fail with light and soft jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the spirit of Christmas, but instead wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most disturbing character in the film. Sally wants to send a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason she needs to be in her letter) so she decides instead to name him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. Also, Sally plays an angel in the play with a word to day: "Hark!" Instead she said a hockey stick (har har). If Sally does not kill you 12 times (it all looks exactly the same) does not kill you, he will not do anything. Peppermint Patty and Marissie are considered a pivotal point, but this hardly makes it any better. Marcy is funny with her replies to Patty, but Patty has another story. She looks like a boy (does not dispel the rumors) and gets mad when she has to be the lamb in the play (Bass the Terrible and all). She seems to be the sheep every year and she is concerned that she will forget her lines (lines that she does not have). She is very concerned that she reminds her twice, one by one, and receives the same response. I suppose they should have short term memory loss, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (though Linus still has annoying advice), but barely reaches a big broadcast time. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this. All in all, trying to be a parasite of origin, but it presents the message to a few quick laughs.
