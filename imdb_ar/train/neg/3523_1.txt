Oh, what a bad film, bad, very bad! It was supposed to be enough to starring Sylvester Stallone and his career, featuring a very large number of rock climbing scenes, dizziness, falling, scene chewing and airborne theft. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a painful rescue operation, the other involves bad people destroying an aircraft for booty, and killing as many nondescript people as possible. John Lethgow, who is usually dependable, and who may be frustrated by the sheer horror of the product, is reduced to being held accountable by those who do not care about him. In the ambiguous approximation of the English accent. Janine Turner, who was ambiguous and mysterious when Maggie played on the northern exposure, is unfortunately lost in the part of the rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is a solid muscle and head. No fatal lines in this one. No living lines, either.
