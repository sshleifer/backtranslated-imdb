When Rodney Dungerfield is on the list, it's Farhana. In my "five wives", it was not on the list. The timing of individual lines has been stopped, but it is the best thing in the film. The five women who play as wives do not add up to one full actress between them. The plot is very weak. Even the hypothesis is very weak. There are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the attitude has little to do with anything else in the film. Most of the film can play the same way even if Rodney's character has only one wife, so the premise seems more like the old man's imagination than an essential part of the comedy. Another old man's imagination: We are supposed to accept that Rodney's character is a sports skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Steller appears to be speaking in his role just to serve the good of friends, and the rest of the name must be simply desperate for action. <br /> <br /> Strange gestures to political correctness later in the film do nothing real in the film. For those who like their films politically correcters, the humor of non-personal computers will still exist in the first place, and the apologies about the phenomenon are still important. For those who hate watching a movie that agrees with their political correctness, PC add-ons are just annoying. <br /> <br /> This movie should be the most moderate film I've ever seen. There are some lively jokes, and the bedroom scenes made a terrible TV 40 years ago, but that's about it. Perhaps the men were bare chested (kidding). <br /> <br /> The DVD shows interviews where cast members seem to find depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or joking. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, "You should be kidding!" There is also a strange peculiar disclaimer that indicates that since the film was not actually called the Mormon or the Church of the Last Day Saints, it does not concern them in one way or another. Do not mind that the film is characterized by a polygamous religion in Utah, and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, my five wives were disappointing wives. I was hoping for Rodney's arrival, but the best I can say about the film is that Rodney looked very good for a man who was paying 80 years at the time.
