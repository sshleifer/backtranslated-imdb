The expectations were fairly high for me when I went to watch this film. After all, I thought that Steve Carell could not make a mistake getting out of great movies like Anshurman, 40-year-old Virgin, and Mays Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I will begin with what is right in this film: at some points, Steve Karel is allowed to be Steve Carell. There were a few moments in the film that made me laugh, and that was almost entirely due to giving him plenty of room to maneuver. He is undoubtedly a talented person, and it is a shame that he signed what he found to be, in my opinion, the wreck of a thorough train. <br /> <br /> With this far from the road, I will discuss what has gone terribly wrong? <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, an widower with three girls being considered for the National Shared Counseling Column. His daughters are preparing to reunite the family, where his extended relatives meet for some time with each other. <br /> <br /> The family is at the top of the list of things that make this movie a bad movie. No family behaves like this. It looks like they were moved from Pleasantville or left to the Beaver. It is a caricature of what we believe to be when the family is seven years old. It reaches the point where it becomes repugnant and simply frustrating. Touching football, crossword contests, family bowling, talent shows are not the actual behavior of people. It's almost annoying. <br /> <br /> Another big drawback is the Karel woman who is supposed to back down. Watching her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a victim of a stroke trying to rehabilitate her. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and innovative in this woman comes moderately late. <br /> <br /> It makes me think this movie is happening on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I had just seen. After thinking more, I do not think it was too much.
