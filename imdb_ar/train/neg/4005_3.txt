I'm a real fan of the original Cracker series, and I own them all on DVD. Cracker had a tendency to be too often at times, but it seems that Robbie Coltran and other cast members, as well as the writers, were always performing it despite themselves. I categorize the original Cracker in the series of Great Brit TV crimes at that time, and there is some fierce competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Sherlock Homes in Jeremy Brett, and another group. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was on top of my list. <br /> <br /> Making "new terrorism" more sad ... <br /> <br /> In the end, this was a very pale tradition of the former Cracker glory. I forced myself to sit in everything, convinced that it could not really be bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Some criticism: First, just to get any bias in the lead: I felt insulted by the anti-US and anti-war. Screed that flies on the length of most show. Topper: Two innocent Americans of any crime were killed and British Junkie, in Fitz's words, "understood, but not justified." I thought "I fought within two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting thing from the drivel?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-American / anti-American tone of my beliefs ... behind politics, I had a clear feeling that this cracker was just a prop for publicity, and it actually helped to undermine a terribly weak scenario. <br /> <br /> Second, how much broadcast time did Ruby Coltran get? Fitz was almost a young actor in this film, as if he were later thinking of some of the stories originally written without any thought of Fitz's role. Coltrane could have carried the show on his broad shoulders that still fit, but the writer seemed to be thinking about other things, missing the opportunity, and with a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: What is experimental? Script! There was some glamor, and two parts of the actual evolution of the character (Fitz's son screams that Fitz can not stay home if his plane flies to Australia, the investigator who loved to beat his poor performance on their backs heads, and some old sparks between Fitz and Missus him) Not enough to carry a boring story. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where was the Panhallagan hell? Now it will be interesting ... Manchester has been after all, and after 10 years it was going to occupy the lead. There is another missed opportunity (or maybe the actress is not interested). <br /> <br /> Well, there is more (bad) to say, but I will end with curiosity: at the end of the show (as broadcast on the BBCA) Director director "was available on the BBC on demand, I thought AH-HA! The cut of the director, who is supposed to pay for it, may have all the good things I expected to see tonight but did not happen like a coherent and interesting story. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit on the terrible free version of "New Terror" in the hope of seeing something, anything, worth seeing, and just to be disappointed, I no longer have the incentive to pay for a second already, possibly a longer version And more boring. In addition, I was angered by the belief that the BBCA segments were cut and shredded, sacrificing display time to accommodate the endless stream (every 10 minutes or so) of commercials, then turned around and asked me to pay for what was supposed to be broadcast tonight . <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of "New Terrorism": It says it all really: "The initial excitement about Robbie Coltran reintroduced his role as a flawed and spoiled punk in the BBC was a self-inflicted Of the criminal psychology world by the obnoxious political author Jimmy McGovern is determined to present in this biograph, shaking first in his letter - that is, the Americans are a handful of young Namibians who did not care about the whitewash of terrorism before hitting our doorstep - McGovern's cry over the purge of the chest overcame the narration and mourned the pleasure of seeing Fitz again p Li the case.
