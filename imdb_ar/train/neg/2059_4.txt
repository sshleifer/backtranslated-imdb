A call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the next target of the killer. The director, Brian de Palma, is emerging here: his camera revolves around the corners of the museum (after spending a long time on a monkey), splits into a fragmented screen for technical purposes and offers a sequence plot (again in a split screen) About transsexuals, and begin its (first) episode during a rainstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is cumbersome, because in the first place we are asked to swallow a lot and not respond anything big. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is modest, and the end (second) is a collection of De Carma's "curry" - not to mention "Psycho". Interpretation of dirty acts plays like a spoof to Hitchcock, not a greeting. Elegant cool steel way, the final results are half-baked clearly. ** from ****
