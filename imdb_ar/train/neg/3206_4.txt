I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to produce a film in the language of Cebuano. (Not a "dialect" because most Filipinos will refer to it incorrectly, since Cebioo and Tagalog are not as mutually understood as the French and Spanish are to each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this film. As a Canadian, of Siabuano's parents, I was optimistic about reviving the Visayan film industry when I heard this film. I was more excited to hear that it was not another stupid action movie or melodrama because Filipinos love these kinds of movies. Unfortunately, I did not make much change. <br /> <br /> The Panaghoy is an ego journey of Cesar Montano. Montano of course plays the hero of the film. When I say "hero" I mean the most stereotypes of literature. His job is to win the girl's heart and lead the Bullons to beat the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. It only suits the mold hero. The rest of the characters are one dimensional. All of them fit their cookie-cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow motion / reflective films but this movie was slow in motion. Meditation was not really about anything. Just because the film is of a historical character, drama and slow motion do not make it a good film. <br /> <br /> Particularly disturbing is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wants to revive the Visayan film industry, he should think about it. He said he wanted to produce Visayan films that could compete in Cannes, Toronto, etc., but in fact, this film had been ridiculed at such festivals. To get Visayan films in the mainstream consciousness, he should have made at least a film that would attract audiences, even if that meant sacrificing quality. He obviously did not think of any kind of films or got information about prizes he received at the Cannes Film Festival, so the film was attracting audiences at least equally. <br /> <br /> I am now afraid that Visayan Films will not be produced for a long time again because of this movie. If I say to the Filipinos at all that I want to see more Visayan films of course, I will get an answer like, "Visayans does not make good films, do not you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course this is ridiculous because it is an example of Visayan film and it is probably the only example that anyone is likely to see these days. <br /> <br /> An example of a contemplative film, not just a slow motion, is the Tagalogi blackout or the story of David Lynch. I hate to promote the Tagalog language where it is promoted to infinity and illegally and push down the throats of Filipino non-Tagalogists, but in order to call spades, I say that Blackout is a very good film. These films are heavily based on what Hitchcock calls "pure cinema". Images without words are used to convey the story. But I give a little definition for these two films in that these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. And they do it very well. Panagui believes that if they simply take sweeping images of the landscape, they establish a mood. <br /> <br /> What happens with a lot of Filipino movies that include either a dead grandmother or a ???
