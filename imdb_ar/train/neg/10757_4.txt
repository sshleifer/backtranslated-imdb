I watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the comments this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" has attracted the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and caused many insults and names naming, too). <br /> <br /> I find this somewhat surprising, because this movie is not great (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even very bad). What this movie really is, is ... depression. Disappointed that the number of filmgoers in the United States are very ready to rise up the rebuttals, and the clich√©s are reheated, describing them as amazing new works. This film "re-renewal" is written everywhere, from the plot line (an uncomfortable mix of Asimov and uber-action in modern times) to Smith's character (cleverly cynical with the spine of titanium), to the special effects (borrowed from Matrix and the number Few others). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, the perfect motion film for today's audience: a superficial plot, a snipyly dialogue, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is modest, but we already know that (it seems another failed attempt for Hollywood to create Bruce Willis Black). The story has a lot of holes in it, of all sizes, but I do not think most people who have been drawn to this film have enough cash to notice them. Maybe the turnout is as standard today, but very B-film compared to the real winners.
