Why waste my time with this film? There was not one funny joke or line all the time. The musician was not funny. Really mean, outside the suction vacuum tube control? Why was the name National Lampoon attached to this film? Even the Christmas holiday was better than this (I thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague!
