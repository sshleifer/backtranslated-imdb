Messi, Ullman and Sutherland were as fantastic as usual. Ritter was not bad either. Her name was beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. Unfortunately the plot was awful. It was quite predictable, trite and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was put as a baby paint by routine numbers. The characters were pieces of cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and this was far superior to acting, which was unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Finally, the screenwriter was not a victim. Especially with the "early" lines of the child, which were completely implausible. <br /> <br /> Again, it's only the behavior that has prevented a much lower degree.
