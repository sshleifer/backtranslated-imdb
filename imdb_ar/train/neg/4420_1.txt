"Everything can be a great documentary" ?? Yes, if the person is deaf or mute or blind. Everything except meaning, wit, visual style, interesting subject. Regardless. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, punk. This movie is completely incorrect. Document adventure without adventure, document war without any sense of war, send from the camp without the impact of intelligence. This does not mean anything, does not feel anything, carries the implicit message that there is nothing at all. No wonder it has a lot of IMDb fans! Of course, your knowledge of a film of the great "Leppman skip" will have no culture, no intelligence, no wit (unlike the erased adolescent joke), and no known human emotion? Only adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are plenty of real documentaries and little time in life to waste on the toilet build up like "Darkon".
