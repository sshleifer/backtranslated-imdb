I will never be a member of any club that would be with me, especially this club. <br /> <br /> Star Andreeff is a single mother / stripper being attacked by a female vampire and left to die. She began to search for blood <br /> <br />, and met John Savage, to look like he was wondering where to leave Michael Simino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> He is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join the small vampire family <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vampire, the blonde patch that <br /> <br /> Star attacked, green dwarf with green hair (do not do this <br /> <br /> up). <br /> <br /> The family does not want a star, so they try to kill Savage, Starr <br /> and Star child. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. </> <br /> Most of his screen time is going to show more facial tics than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant is on Jolt Cola, and reads all his lines like <br /> <br /> He makes a film Farley Brothers. Andreeff tries to make <br /> <br /> more of a poorly written role, but the screenwriter / director Robin goes <br /> <br /> for all the vampire suckers, like a star eating hamsters for her son. /> And buy a lot of raw meat to fight the blood desire. The child is also often exposed to those who believe that violence against children is really fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is very strange, but not in the wild, on top like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue". Here, the total gross portion is not justified at all, it only happens. <br /> <br /> It's only in the budget. Most of the R class goes to Andreeff <br /> <br />, who are placed through awkward barricades in the background <br /> <br /> for the conversation viewer. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> The vampires' tusks! All vampires here must stab at their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> A great idea, unless you have already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin". <br /> <br /> Even in 77 minutes, once you throw Robben's attempts in the direction of <br /> <br /> arty direction, this is one trip <br /> <br /> Tired Boring and dirty. Leave this club bathed, <br /> <br /> You'll need it. <br /> <br /> This level (R) has been classified for strong physical violence, armed violence and sex <br /> <br /> Violence, strong heirs, strong abusive words, female nudity, >, Drug addiction, and adult cases. <br /> <br />
