Perhaps Margaret Lawrence did not deny any of her novels to the film, let alone the Angel Angel. It was Hagar, as a personality, who constantly defied the social base (Jenays who dares, anyone?), And almost ended up sacrificing her humanity in this process. The symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) are a permanent reminder of this old and new conflict, and the massacre (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the film is reasonably loyal to the book's plot (but it's not actually a kind of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the goal of capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's challenge (in order to challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much more raw than what was filmed, and Hagar's father could have played a "traditional" role, so to speak. If the director insists on a stronger shot, the film will take the point directly to the house. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic products and other updates? Do we try to make some points in order to raise some points (for example, Muslim and indigenous peoples). Hajar & Co. Everything is politically incorrect in the book, so why should we see it in the film version. The update may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send politically correct initial messages unrelated to the novel (and the film) seems to be aimed at punches down the mind. <br /> There is also an audience. It seems that we were conditioned to see the bitter old people gentle and loving. Why should you laugh every time you emigrate in fits of anger? I doubt that Magaret Laurence wanted to laugh her readers at Hagar or with her. These people are frustrated and worried, and all we do is laugh at them. I do not think they have done Hajar and other people in their position any justice.
