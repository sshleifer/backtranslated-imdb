First of all, let me say that this is not a movie for people looking to watch something fun and happy to spend their holidays. This movie is cool, brutal and just depressed. Mary Steenbergen plays the role of a vulgar mother who backs down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job, loses his home, can not buy Christmas gifts for children, etc. You get the idea, happy things to spend. So Harry Dean Stanton comes in as Christmas angel, wearing a dark hat and a long coat that is very much like the peddlers who walk around the children all day watching. What is the best way to instill Christmas spirit in Mary Stenbergen from killing her family and then offer to return them if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is blackmail, and the Christmas workshop looks like a haven for displaced Nazis on the ground. The film puts everything so thick that you do not care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the film is very bitter and unreasonable. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like Kapra, but it left the joy and feeling of what it should have been a holiday movie.
