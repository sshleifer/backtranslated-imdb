A woman asks for advice on the way to a mysterious town, and hears two strong stories from the local stranger, both of them related to the zombie. But maybe fate has something bad in the store for her ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact I have to admit, it was so bad that I quickly sent across most of the garbage. There was a lot of it, believe me. It works for only 69 minutes, and there are still tons of stuffing. You get some hair-shaved heads that do a lot of pushing, a lot of blurry tribal scenes among demented teenagers (which rejuvenate and swing) and some good examples of why some people should not become actors. <br /> <br /> For title characters, they hardly have a footnote in the film. Why, you can get an undead procedure in the foreground more than you do the previous feature! However, given the transparency of the eyes flowing from the sockets and the sequence of minds (among other "delights"), this may be a convincing blessing. <br /> <br /> They may look fantastic. I liked it was filmed on someone's mobile phone to broadcast on youtube. The work of a jerky camera, scratches on the print, dim lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was manufactured in 2001, not 1971. Even clothes and elegant appearance about three decades ago! <br /> <br /> If you think I'm not eligible to do a Chronicles review that I have not seen the entire movie, follow. I tried to sit through it, betting that you would not even be able to debut in the blue-colored freaks smart before making excuses and leaving. It is really laughable that anyone chooses to launch it, and frankly, you will enjoy your drink on the disc more than torture your DVD player already with this funny excuse for the horror. In fact, do not be surprised if you have bags and sheets in the morning, leaving you to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S What kind of horror has an 18-year rating kept by women in a huge athletic bra during the compulsory sex scene ?! See, the movie can not even get this part correctly ...
