This little steel horror film is actually one of the best Rene Harlin movies. The story is fairly routine, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come true; in fact, the ghost story is a late idea. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Rene H has no spare part in showing how bad the old, shabby, leaking, rat-filled hell (with a sadistic guard, too!) Is usual in the leading role, supported by some very authentic prisoners ( There are no beautiful boys in this cast.) Horror lovers must check this one out.
