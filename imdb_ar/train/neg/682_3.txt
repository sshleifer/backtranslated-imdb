Please note: I see from various publications that there is a silent original as well as an audio version of the same movie. I've seen the audio version and was aesthetically yicky. Since some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without dubbing Kribi, I should read my assessment taking into account this. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Renee Clare enjoys a beautiful reputation as a film director and Louis Brooks is a bit of a cult following too, and this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood has already turned into sound mode in about 1929, until early to the mid-30s almost, many famous French films had essentially silent films - with some very cool dialogue and sound effects on top of the film. Lip movements in many people, especially this film, do not even come close to matching what is being said and this explains why an American like Ms. Brooks made a French film. It's just dirty and you'd better have made a silent film - and as a silent film, this would be a medium film - with excellent camera work (sometimes) and some silent acting. <br /> <br /> The problem I found with the movie was also the very simplified plot. For silent moral play around 1920, it was good, but by 1930, the plot was a little conspiracy (meaning "old" - not "slutty"). A woman wins a beauty contest and can not be dealt with by her male fianc√©. They give up everything, temporarily, but they are tempted to return to luxury life and that's the end! Melodrami boy, huh? And also some simplification and underdevelopment. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found the character of a friend of the preacher (?) very disturbing and unrealistic. It was like Harold Lloyd and spent a lot of the movie being abused and picked up by the friend and everyone. When it was taken throughout the film and no decision was made, his character seemed unnecessary and the treatment he received was full of vigor. Was the audience supposed to laugh because it was abused? This seems to me that this is implied and I do not like it at all. <br /> <br /> FAR French movies are better than the times (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, etc.) as well as silent films are better. I can not understand the high rating of this film.
