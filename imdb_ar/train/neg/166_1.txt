Well, first, I did not sit down to watch the prime minister of the series "Star Trek" to see the cowboys flying in space. This is how the regular Enterprise loop works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a sdema or something different and wants to take a closer look but may destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 Send a shuttle to the nebula and damage the shuttle ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are caused by stupid errors from Archer. Hey and did you see a preview episode showing one kissing Archer and TABUL?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch this episode but then I completely abandoned Enterprise and moved to the TV immediately. Come on!!!! This is a STAR trip !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was with a banana alloy ?? In one episode, Ho Chi had a banana alloy but had to leave it for a stupid reason. Well, well, a little stupid to bring you a living animal in space but whatever. Well, that's what I thought about until they left it on a desert planet !!!!! Bovine bananas can not be left in the desert !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers? <br /> <br /> In any way, just say if Enterprise is working not to see it !!!!!
