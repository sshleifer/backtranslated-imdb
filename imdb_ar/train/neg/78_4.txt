I got the annoying mouse and I really did not have anything to do with the story ... it's something I'd do in my first year at the movie school. very sad. In addition, the story seemed to last for a long time without apparent reason ... there were a lot of things that were thrown out there that had nothing to do with the story, making me feel that the creative team did not really know what it was, or should have been Be shorter ... who would have been a blessing, not a crime. I've just watched all the episodes up to this moment over the last week ... I would say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others to start this episode.
