The second half of Stephen Soderbergh's revolutionary biography revolves around Che Guevara's recent campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. In order to preserve his saintly vision of Che Soderberg, the mass executions he led after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his adventure in the Congo ("This is the History of Failure") began to focus entirely on Che's attempt to rally support for the revolution against the government In Bolivia. It could turn out to be a catastrophe and Guevara's final film. <br /> <br /> The first episode follows him here, where Soderberg slows down his film to become a creep to study the gentle features of the contemplative Guevara once again like James Dean in the East of Aden by Borneo del Toro. The problem is that Guevara did not achieve much success in acquiring converts, and soon found himself and his starving companions swallowing in the heart of the Bolivian jungle darkness. Unlike Werner Herzog in Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh fails to exploit the potential of the jungle metaphor to increase the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more interested in keeping the chi nimbus over his head than exploring panic at dead ends. There is a single Herzog moment where Che sits on the back of a stubborn horse kicking and screaming to move it but the general scene of Soderberg is still flat and husky and uninterested. <br /> <br /> In each of his films, Soderberg shows that it is clear that he is from the Chi group and because of this his focus remains short-sighted and narrow. Spends a lot of time building his memorial on Che and a little in developing his relationships with key players in his epic, especially Fidel Castro. To make matters worse, he does so with a slow and unemotional approach that does not ignite the fire. One might think that he was overwhelmed by enough of Eisenstein and Firtov to realize that the overall change had been presented much better in a sweeping manner.
