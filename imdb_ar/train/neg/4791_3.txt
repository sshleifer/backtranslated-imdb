* Spoliers * Do not read more if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Tracing after the "Phantasm II" is over; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike while Reggie and the new kid Tim spend the bulk of the rest of the movie trying to get it back. , And do not end up as slaves on "Red Planet" in Tall Man. This is very ridiculous: the trio of burglars in the bright pink hearts were only there for comic relief, and the black karate chick (could not remember her name) was so troublesome that I could not wait to see if the long killer had killed her character. This seems to be the character of Tim, who comes late and is the hero in the end, but ... does not work that way. By the end of this story, Liz's head has been cut by the deadly pygmies, Mike gets a silver ball planted in his skull, gets Reggie balls and the Pygmies get Tim, and no one left to stop The Tall Man. The bad guys won - now how did that happen in the end? <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in 1993 and was not released until 95. The end of this final time, although disappointing and unpleasant, was also an appropriate and appropriate end to this strange little series. But the fourth changes this ending and adds something new but more bad jokes, worse end and more nonsense ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
