I'm sure that in the depths of Jack Black's comfort, the character of Nacho Libre is extremely hilarious but not. You can tell ol Jacks that there is a whale of time to play with Mexican fluffy and atomic monks with dreams of becoming wrestlers but this movie is a total imbalance in every section. <br /> <br /> I just sat there during most of the film thinking "Is this supposed to be funny" and "This is the guy from Tenacious D is not it?". The truth is that this film has nothing to offer. Absolutely! It's a bad scenario with crazy characters and really acting and directing. You'll see endless moments where you think something funny is about to happen but it does not happen. I was bored of stupidity about 10 minutes but will definitely continue. he did not do. After 90 minutes, I barely managed to ward off aneurysms, it was painful. <br /> <br /> It seems like you remember years ago when you saw anything with your favorite actress, so some of those early papas were famous and you were really embarrassed that the actor in question was actually in such a load . Yes, it was. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's previous movies like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come to the guy. If you do it again, Jack, I'll have to come there and show your knees or anything else. At least give you a serious talk. <br /> <br /> I know it's clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
