I was fascinated by how bad this film was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something or think about something here? What was it with gourd? Was I supposed to be affected by the hotel? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on the roof across the hotel street? Why does the narrator make vain use of the people he meets (obviously he has edited the really useful parts of his interviews to make fun of). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor who told us how bad this film was before it ended. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I think the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or trying to convince the intellectual community.
