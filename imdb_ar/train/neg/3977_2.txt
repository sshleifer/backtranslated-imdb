The two twin sisters, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, went up to the sitcom like "Two Kinds", and I'd never seen them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. In fact, the two sisters Hunter Charlie (Mary Keith) and Lili (Ashley) are in Rome to attend a summer training program, but soon after they start work, they are immediately launched due to a series of accidents. But the man who owns the company they work with, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), brings them back to their jobs, slowly proving themselves useful assets, and talented artists (fashion), helping to prevent an average man from taking over. Leslie Danone as Jamie, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Elinia Lazarin in Dorari, Archie Kau as Nobo, Valentina Matulini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patrici as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this movie is designed to go directly to the video, and that the camera's work is not exactly identical, and that does not help when you want to like the Rome scenes. In fact, the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters of the most troublesome hooligans around them, I knew before I watched that they would not care about me in any way (this is not even that beautiful) and that is awful from the trash film. Very poor!
