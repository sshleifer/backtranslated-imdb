It seems as if in science fiction you have this periodic recoil to perform a strange phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It is the place where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) infuses a revolutionary story full of excitement. However, the sequences take this universe and lead you through the garden to any new social or political commentary little the author wants to present. The matrix is ​​in the end the equivalent film. Matrix stands long alone, as an interesting film with a strange twist in the middle. When you see this cash cow sitting there only, wanting to explore other aspects of society, writers and directors lead you to what should be some of the most painless monologues and panels in science fiction. Although the images are still spectacular from the first films, however, the new explorations of the characters fall horribly in the sequel. Watch the eye candy, not to think deeply. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, as recorded in this wonderful site.
