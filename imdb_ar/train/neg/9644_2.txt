First thing first. The first thing you need in this type of music is good music, and that is where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> Music is dim and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who removed the letter "A" from his spelling, and did a good job but was not useful for bad movies like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN looks like a doll used to entertain the audience, although it is good to consider but its role in the film is to dance, they are actually dancing to a rock band and I do not think any rock band has a dancer as a band member. <br /> <br /> In the walnut case, this film is part of the folly of a piece of paper. Watch it if you want to get fooled.
