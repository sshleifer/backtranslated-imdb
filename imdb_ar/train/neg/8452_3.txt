This is the first time I comment on a film because I felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. Over the past few months, ABC Family has launched a new feature film. I have seen the last three and enjoyed them. They shared and did the trick. My wife loves these films. I was looking forward to showing "See Jane's History". The trailers looked great. Unfortunately, this is one film in which the book must be a light year before the efforts of writers and musicians participating in this project. It was 2003, the source (all bad), the result was as interesting as riding the elevator in a department store. He was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. I worked against it. I work in film and television. I enjoy being absolutely entertained. This is one case I kept thinking about - can it get worse? The text contains lines of another contract and I know that these women can act but you will not know it from this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. Advice to Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Producer executives: Under no circumstances should you hire a composer or music director to do any of your future movies. They have lost their interest and have to understand what the word "contemporary", "present day" and "current" mean when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world going through you. All in all a great disappointment from the people at von Zerneck-Sertner and the ABC family.
