I really wish I could give a negative vote, because I think I've lost 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror film ever presented. I've been acting just a terrible god, I mean really bad, the dialogue was worse, the script looked as if it was written .... I can not think of anything terrible enough to say. Today's "exterior" and night "inside" footage make you think the events took several days. Behaved terribly, directed, written, etc. along the way to gofer how to get lunch for everyone. Stay away from this one at all costs. If the only saving grace to stay away from hell is to do one good job, you should tell the world not to see this nonsense. This film is the exact reason why not take horror movies seriously.
