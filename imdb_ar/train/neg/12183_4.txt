Christ. A sequel to one of the most famous films of all time, at least this is gently ignored by songs (except for the unbearable "tomorrow" tape) but continues to imitate nausea and laughter. This time, Annie and her friends go to London and get caught up in the Joan Collins plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some nonsense. The film has an eccentric attitude toward his character named Controversy with how furious she is: every time a small bugger yells "Leapin Lizards!" I felt my teeth bend to powder. The film, which was filmed in a depressing, depressing and crushing way, contains only one unforgettable line ("Unleash Me, You are a stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not original to recommend.
