It's a bad film, it seems there are only 5 policemen in Hong Kong, and they did not use weapons, and that makes me feel like Jackie Chan's movie. All the time they used their weapon to refer to the suspect only. When they finally use their weapon when they kill each other, what a funny film. In the film, it seems as if all good people died for no reason. <br /> <br /> As the movie story sucks, you jump on the story here and there and the people are bored. But if you want to see a bloody film, I think this is just a kind of film, I think the zombie film that was made by the United States is more bloody than this film
