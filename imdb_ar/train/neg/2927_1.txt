Somewhere, there, there must be a list of the worst gay films every time. One contains stylized footage of stars sitting and staring intensely into space, or one where they focus unexpectedly on small cats that eat spaghetti. This is a story of a boy and a boy who live and love and swim and stumble in the caves. One of them has a depressed mother and the other has no mother. They talk, walk, walk, have sex, get sex drunk, break up, go to hospital for eight days and then go out. And rewind there are endless long shots of one looking at space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's a kind of weird filmmaking style or maybe the film is so bad they have to fill it with long and wasted shots because otherwise if they have to rely on a piece of land or a story, the film will be about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, it's about the thirty gay film I've seen in the past 6 months, some of them (mostly) are very imaginative, predictable and boring, but that's really a terrible waste of the best thing so far. "I thought, oh, no, you will be a sinister creator of mah" but I gave her a chance and watched it and then when I finished, I threw the DVD in the trash, sorry I did not like it and if I did, sorry if I was insulted.
