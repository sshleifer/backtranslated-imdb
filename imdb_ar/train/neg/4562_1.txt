I did not feel as if I had been raped just like I did with Christmas, but Billy's magic world is still the opposite of beauty and beast. Like Christmas, BMW hates its audience, although it does not hate this class. It's ugly, insane, stupid, and terribly bad writing. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all, it's a group of people who read. I wanted to dissect her, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because no one in his right mind takes this clamp seriously. What we have here are three stories. The "ideal word" is an odd and strange study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" does not work unless you can accept that Babette's name is Vivi already and that she is a deceptive James Bond and that Lumiere is stupid for women. Perhaps the "broken wing" (or "wind break" as I like to call it) is the ugliest in the group. Monster hates birds? How long? You do not see this file - every version of this video deserves to burn. Beauty and the beast are still cinematic, a celebration of love, art, intelligence and human spirit.
