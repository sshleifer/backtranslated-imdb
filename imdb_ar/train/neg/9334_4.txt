The flick, in Mexico, about a successful man (Scott Glenn) took a trip with the struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after his success. Pushing them to take him to the border ?? But things are out of control. <br /> <br /> She starts well enough, but quickly struggles and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The final relationship has been set up badly and difficult to believe. The lack of passion, and without any reason behind leaving it to one man for the other, made it ridiculous - and the finish was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the knockout route, but seems a bit confused about how boring and slow the scenario is ...
