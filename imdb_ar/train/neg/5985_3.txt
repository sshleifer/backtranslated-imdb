This film is just children against this evil type. Thunderbirds are just the key to getting people to see it, but they're almost in use. The fact that work is happening on Tracy Island is just a trick to attract the public. It was interesting to note what filmmakers were looking at in the future and how the world fit together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is some of the lines given by Lady Penelope which are very comedy. This provided some light comfort for those who expect to rerun the TV series. <br /> <br /> After I said it was going 90 minutes or so in an "enjoyable" way, and thus may be worth watching.
