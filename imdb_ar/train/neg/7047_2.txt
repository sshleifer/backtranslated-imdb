Be careful: Zeta-Jones and McGregor do not play the main role because the poster will believe it. Their roles are really simple. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, with no real concern. In particular, I find it impossible to garner much sympathy for the protagonist, let alone his obsessive friends and obsessed sexual fiancee. The plot continues terribly, and it was closed after about 2/3 - which is unusual for me, as I like to finish what I start. A good setting and a nice take from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
