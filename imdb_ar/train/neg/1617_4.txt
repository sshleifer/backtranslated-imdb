What an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Certainly no concessions are made to Hollywood Special Effects or Entertainment. No background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered with a thick beard and Spanish is a strange monotonous tail that looks as though it were in the middle of the battle or talking about setting fire to the camp. <br /> <br /> I've seen these films (Parts 1 & 2) as an educational experience, and not really something to go to and enjoy. It is very long and in dim places. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that because there is no land, I do not think it is very instructive. <br /> <br /> It is also hard to understand any story from the film dialog - it would be good to read some news about history so that you can understand the context of what is happening, because for some reason the director did not see fit to inform the public why Which they followed - and as a result there seemed to be groups wandering around the forest for no particular reason and taking pictures. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie more stars to somehow generate some empathy with me and develop my personal depth, but somehow all the characters were still strange to me in the end. The stars you get are for realism and show the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
