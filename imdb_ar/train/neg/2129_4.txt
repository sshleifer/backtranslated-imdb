In my humble opinion, this version of BDWY's stunning music contains only two things - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a photocopy with the original text. (Well Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But to me that's all. Most of the actors seem to walk in the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea of ​​Kim's real identity. No wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when he plays George Wendt who seems to prefer to return to a bar chair in Boston. Jason Alexander is acceptable, but the wig has to go and I saw the best dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the script now, but I hope the young people there, who have never seen music, do not judge them all.
