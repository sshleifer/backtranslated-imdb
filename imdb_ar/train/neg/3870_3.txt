Under the thick green bending of the computer graphics there, the amazing art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro brightened. Unfortunately: I lost in Goo. The old Edo scenes - with courtesy, drifting on Sumida, practicing and acting in Nakamura-za - are all exciting and attractive, bringing you back to an interesting and enriching era. The movement on the Kabuki theater, in which Somegoro excelled and stimulated, was richer than any of the absurd jokes that followed. The skill and energy of the audience and the colors of the groups were more satisfying than all the nonsense that captured the plot and performance. What a missed opportunity! One of the best surviving kabuki representatives, is lost in Derek.
