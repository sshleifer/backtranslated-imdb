This film was based on reality? I sincerely hope I will not do it! <br /> <br /> We recognize what appears to be a number of armed policemen unloading an equal amount of guns on two men who only got an armored trunk. This is a great idea; ... Sorry, but what about those big heads that can not be missed from fat or their legs in order to scream out loud. Or are there invisible tanks protecting them? Were they from Crypton? Have I missed something here? <br /> <br /> This film began to fit enough, but after 20 minutes of shooting, it really took a boring turn. <br /> <br /> This documentary technique has not been useful to me either, but it's just something you find popular or not. <br /> <br /> Things are incredibly incredible which makes it difficult to see through 'til the end. <br /> 3/10 For fine editing.
