It behaves very badly. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this view if you see it. Turn it off. Or you can swing for the next 30 minutes. It should not have been broadcast. It's not great. You should never see it. Never ever. So far, if you want to watch this offer, please do not do it. I turn to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel to Hannah Montana, Wizards of Weaverly Place, or Nick to Drake and Josh, these are far better family shows. So believe me in this, I've seen it before. Which is frankly, frankly, the worst program I've ever seen, and I watched a lot of TV shows. Is it known to me, and you have not seen this show.
