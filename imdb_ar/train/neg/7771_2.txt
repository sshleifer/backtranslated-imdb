This strange film has been hacked together, feel that the bond company had to enter into this film, I am not surprised by the lack of credits in this film, who want to be associated with this film. The work of all the participants behaves terribly and the plot moves from all over the place, all of which makes little sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to come because it seemed there were a lot of footage that was not filmed, and all the music was very inappropriate library music (I think it is cheap). Very strange indeed I might buy a DVD from him if he could allow me to get into what was going on in hell and what happened to that movie.
