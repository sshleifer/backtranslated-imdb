Contains spoilers The film plot can be summarized in a few sentences: three young men go hunting in the forest. Two of them along other people are shooting at the head without explanation. The last man can stand in a clear place, yell and do anything without getting shot. He gets to walk through an old factory and has evil going on its scale without conflict. The bad guys wear comfortable clothes in black and look like bad guys. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story, not a summary but in detail. Everything is drawn with a man standing ringing the doorbell. We are waiting for him. Long shot of bored men in the woods and sleep. We can take a nap with them. It was supposed to be ransom derived from the followers of a woman running jogging as if regain strength, if we can see her butt or her breasts broken. <br /> <br /> There is a less dialog box and the Terminator is terminated and not because of too many actions. The characters just do not talk. And then, they do not even have a tacky thing to say like "I'll be back". If my friend launches this weekend, I will cheer him, because it is very feat to discover camera controls. The money girl to rent this as a DVD disc is quite inconvenient. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing is the manager's extra command, how the local police did not realize they were shooting and treating them like a random person walking around with a pistol. If they film it, I'll be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie.
