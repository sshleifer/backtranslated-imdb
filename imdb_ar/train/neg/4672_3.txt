This movie has beautiful collections and Albert Finney does a great job like a cruel father. The film failed because Jennifer Lee's Jason is immensely like a daughter and is unparalleled in the performance of the most mature Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The conclusion of the italian film contrasts with the contradictory conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, brutally ridiculed women in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
