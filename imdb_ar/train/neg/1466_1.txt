<br /> <br /> As usual, I was really looking forward to a TV / new film about my favorite subject - a nice change from a documentary film * strangely familiar to Kursk or Stalingrad on the history channel. I was eagerly looking forward to Pearl Harbor and the enemy at the gates - but was rudely brought to earth with the realization of the malignant Hollywood power that was stupid - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe. <br /> <br /> So, again, I was excited about the Rise of Evil, especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, so I enjoyed his books. I can see why he resigned. <br /> <br /> I quote a person responsible for this trash: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic piece." "It was very dry, we needed more accidents." <br /> <br /> Accidents? Are they nuts completely? Hitler's life was without an "incident" - yes, Cirta Herche in the Kershaw volumes was long and detailed, but it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> It seems that the thesis behind the "Rise of Evil" is: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a very bad man, he hated the Jews, and only in case you lost this, We will emphasize the truth in every scene in the film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort at all to try to explain the mood of time and why Hitler adopted his views and strategies. Needless to say - in contrast to the generally excellent Nazi "Warning of History" - this film neglected to refer to the fact that almost all of Munich's Communist leaders were Jews, and that this may have covered his views on the subject - and his obvious connection between Jews and Bolshevism - Very crucial to understanding much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to be done - the filmmakers did not go there, so we got all the things we knew anyway. We certainly do not get the remarkable truth pointed out by Kershaw, which briefly made Hitler a socialist / Communist after the First World War. It will of course be very complicated to process the film, and may detract from the "very bad" mantra that relentlessly moves away. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a charming figure as a public speaker and in more private situations. It can be polite and even sympathetic, and of course adopt some opinions such as plant, anti-alcohol, anti-smoking that can be agreed upon by many readers of the Guardian. He was also fond of animals, and from here this innovative scene of dog flogging was very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> He was also, from all the accounts I saw, a brave soldier in the First World War. While we saw him with his iron cross, we could not see how he won (the courageous deeds were not in the scenario, and needless to say). Nor do we have any idea why he was affected by his war experiences, while Sasson, Owen, Brock, Remark and many others found a very repulsive experience. Again, like the above mentioned point in the Jewish / Bolshevik link, this is vital for anyone to understand the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why do I think it has always been a good idea, despite the tremendous evidence on the contrary? Why did not he care about his colleagues who died? Or perhaps did so - but he is still drawing the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This film certainly did not have any interest in saying this. <br /> <br /> Days, the film is a classic example of "making history relevant to the present", inventing things or leaving embarrassing facts to match the "present" - which is often the lowest common denominator, where you do not trust your audience Only one inch, so you can just get rid of your throat, knowing (unfortunately correctly) that you will always fail because there are so many idiots in the world. <br /> <br /> History is about making us close to the past and seeing how our present is being colored, for better and for worse. This garbage was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it. The sites and the big scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us anything at all that we did not already know, and they did not promote understanding this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
