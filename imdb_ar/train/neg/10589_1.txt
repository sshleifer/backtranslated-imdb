Global Soldier: Back is not the worst movie ever. No, this honor should go to a film that tried to make some statements or perform some art but failed in a pathetic or offensive way. However, perhaps no film I have ever seen tried too little and did just as Universal Soldier: The Return did. <br /> <br /> This movie is a science fiction / thriller that does not contain anything recommended. The acting is as bad as any film I have ever seen. The plot is awesome and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone connected remotely to this film should be ashamed of himself. United States: The Return Make Van Damme's former fare look like a leading film masterpiece. Some movies are too bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what to say here. I doubt that many people are thinking of seeing this movie if they do not already, but only in case: no.
