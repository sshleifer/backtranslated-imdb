After watching half the film just at school again in November, today, I saw that it was on the Flix channel and decided to watch it to watch the rest of the movie and write a new review on it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, Hatchet, is fine. This is a terrible adaptation though. <br /> <br /> Awful (and I mean terrible), bad dialogue, and average cinematic portrayal of this terrible adaptation of Hatchit. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Bryan, a cliche portrait of a late-80s teenager (who wears a mule and hits his head with rock music in the 1980s) and his mother drives his car in a car to fly on a plane to fly to see his mum ... Cue and an exciting pause.) Now Brian said goodbye to Mom and the dog and fly to see his father. The pilot was fat, ugly and rude (not like that in the book) who had a heart attack and died two minutes later in the air. The book goes into more details as the pilot suffers from more pain and appears to have been in the air much longer before the pilot has a heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within two more minutes) became empty on fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to suppose that it was awake for hours even though the sun had not changed and its appearance was exactly the same.) It has now been destroyed. <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is so different then it was in the book. In the book, he said that his jacket was torn into small pieces, but in the film he was absolutely good without tears or tears (he seemed to have bought it only), never said he had climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, slept there on the mountain, Before a bear (Moses was told, but not Dibba), and he never said that he ate many of the mistakes he made, never mentioned the second hurricane or he learned to get those birds. , Their skin, their eating or the trap of the small fish farm he makes (destroyed by a hurricane) and does not remember him hurting his ribs from a hurricane. <br /> <br /> So you think you can call what was filmed in a hurricane movie. Everything was just a windstorm that dropped many of its own things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival was memories of the lame Brian memories (never mentioned in the book), especially the clich√© scene to awaken Brian to the top, walking to the window and seeing his father (with all his things Packed which can fit perfectly with the back of his truck) and he leaves and yells "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDD !!!!" (But of course he did not hear his father even though he was directly outside) and his fist through the window (WTF?). <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing close to what happened in the book (I said close). In this book, I think one of the main things that Brian's rescue pilot said when he landed was "You're the kid they're looking for! They've stopped for months." But they left that line in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic ending with Brian (in some way without consultation or treatment) that goes back to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume that they were meeting for Thanksgiving (because they have a turkey on the table.) Then his temporary house appears (apparently, in the film, like three days, but in the book was for several months) and has his grudges, no Still in the tree where he left (as did not happen in the book) illustrates the place where a letter is carved, it has been quite so: "Home" (where is it really supposed to believe that he carved that perfectly perfect with these scorns?) <br /> <br /> There is no quote that can summarize this film better. Then when Enid of Ghost World said, "This is very bad, it has gone well and is going back to bad." Perfect description of this film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone (did not read the book) and just looking for a movie and I saw someone else read the book (because they would be disappointed and bored to death. <br /> <br /> For those who read The book, leave your imagination as a film, this is bad and will bring down your thoughts about the book.
