It was one of the worst I've ever seen. Dreyville PURE How anyone can develop a relationship with the heroine, or sympathy for her, is beyond me. I felt I was watching the history of a person with schizophrenia suffering from a personality disorder. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, it can be seen as an attempt to produce a film "and art" - but I have not been able, throughout my life, to find any art in it at all. <br /> <br /> If this woman has lived in today's world, she would have been transferred to a mental institution and will receive a two-day treatment with antipsychotics. This, or simply allows to roam the streets and become a woman bag. Why did other characters in this film find anything to recover - and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress - talking more about her illnesses than any convincing qualities she had made worthy of this effort.
