Despite being a great admirer of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, only about 6 years ago I saw "Follow the Fleet". I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but I did not know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the attractive songs and personal Ginger Rogers are sweet and funny, I just do not like Pick Becker. While trying to compensate his partner for a long time, he was constantly sabotaging her career. His character does not enjoy the usual sense of humor and the characters of other Astaire films for other films. <br /> <br /> Worth watching for songs and a great solo guitar by Ginger Rogers.
