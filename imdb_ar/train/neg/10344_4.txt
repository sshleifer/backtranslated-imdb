Watch this movie ran in the early hours of traditional Chinese medicine. Several problems with the film were clear from what I saw. First, adults did not reach the age of 10 years. Several parts of the film faced problems of continuity. For some reason, the actor who played the role of the youngest son seemed to be the greatest when the 10 years passed. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a large gap appeared with a black screen. It's very bad, because although the script left nothing to be desired, Bergman and Rosell were all right in the film in their roles. It is shameful that the big piece is missing, but what is here is the water. <br /> <br /> I hope everything is the same. Does the text mean that Bergman's personality is sent when the children are young but are sent back to care when they are adults? Some timelines are also meaningless. There is a collapse in the stock market similar to 1929, but children grow up to fight in the First World War. All the actions of the support people in this film are fine. I was just wondering what was in the 20 films gap I could not see because it was missing.
