I think Philip Kaufmann read a copy of the Notes slide from Kundera's novel and then began making this film. Well, of course it will not be the original punch. Cond√©ra novels are wonderful because of his manipulation of the concept of narration, and his ability to enter and exit stories he builds. This movie does not even try! Tereza's sequence of dreams, which is vital to the atmosphere of the book, has been reworked, meaningless at all. Well, perhaps this is a lesser point, Danielle Dae Lewis looks like Ben Stiller's in this (I know it's not really a complaint, but hey). A perfect example of a Hollywood fine literature otherwise.
