This film is reminiscent of Bollywood's reminder that it is just a Hollywood parasite. Bollywood also tends to overcome previous music movies to promote its industry. <br /> <br /> Vidhu Vinod Chopra filmed this movie on the grounds that a combination of "Deewar" and "On the Waterfront" cocktails would win the Oscar. This turned out to be an upward error. <br /> <br /> Even the title idea is inspired by the classic Elijah Kazan story. Originally, Brando appears as a high dove as a symbol of peace. <br /> <br /> Bollywood must come out of the shadow of Hollywood if it needs to be taken seriously.
