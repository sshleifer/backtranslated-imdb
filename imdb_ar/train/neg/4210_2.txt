Richard Tyler is a small boy afraid of everything. He does not like riding his bike or climbing his tree house because he knows the kind of accidents that might happen to him. So one day he rides his bicycle and because it's raining, he decides to wait in the library until the rain stops. The whole story takes place. He suffers from all kinds of staff, and in the end he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is incredible, and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than it is.
