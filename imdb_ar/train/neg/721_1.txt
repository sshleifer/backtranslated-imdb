This film has many major flaws. The first and most important is the apparent lack of a good conspiracy! Which makes it sad that the film is not only difficult to watch, but also sends the viewer some feelings of despair, as if wasting precious time in his short life. This means that the film can not capture its audience, but it encourages the audience to watch the film and all that is associated with it! In short, it is really very very very very very bad too! If you prefer to chew on a large rubber shoe, you will find it more enjoyable and enjoyable than watching the Terminator Woman.
