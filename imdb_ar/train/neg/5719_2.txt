This movie is very much like a movie Hostel, except acting * BAD * and not thrill. The items are there, but you do not really feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence very ineffective. Some strange parts just ... like forcing a snake down the throat. What's up with that? Is this supposed to be scary or sincere? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture, there is no truth (except for the man who was burned at first, which does not appear at all). The main villain continues to say, "Let them die slowly," but the butcher kills them all very quickly. Deaths are all relatively fast. Yes, I saw the "Uncategorized" version. Overall, it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but not good at all. You will not miss anything if you skip this one.
