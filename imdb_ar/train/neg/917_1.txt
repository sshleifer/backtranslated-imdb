This film was in really poor taste. The script was really bad. I am truly saddened by the late Gregory Beg who took the lead in this film which contains B movie of one of the greatest generals of history. The film was politically incorrect and frankly insensitive to others who fought the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene where I almost vomited, the film showed McCarthy in a hideout on Corregidor Island talking to troops like a seasoned politician when he came across a wounded, a Filipino soldier with legs. The soldier bleeds and dies and can sit directly at the general's eyes and say, "No Daddy, No Mama, No Uncle Sam" and McCarthy gives his sharp talk that the Americans will "never give up" the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier enlivening McCarthy's words and giving him a smart greeting. I mean, if there is a more consistent scene that portrays the United States as the world's greatest white savior, please let us know because this scene takes the cake. He has shown that the Filipinos are in distress and incapable of honor and rely on great Americans only for redemption. It has blatantly overshadowed the contributions of members of the USFE. These are Filipino volunteers who became integrated into the US military during the Second World War, who died alongside the Americans fighting the Japanese who marched alongside the Americans in the march of death Patan and defended Corigidor Island by launching a guerrilla attack after McCarthy left for Australia with his famous "I'll be back" speech. My late grandfather, a veteran of the Second World War for the Filipinos and a soldier in the US Air Force, was one of those who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the motherland. I think this film does not honor them and the thousands of others whom McCarthy relied on in the intelligence preparations for his famous return to the landing of the Littie Bay.
