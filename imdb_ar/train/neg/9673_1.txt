"Plants are the most savage and ferocious forms of life," one prospective doppler tells a victim in the film "The Seedpeople," a silly and silly remake of "The Bodysnatchers Invasion" and "Day of the Trifids" by A. Moovies. And why the Mor seeds are dangerous from plants, one might wonder? Because, according to the same puppet, "seeds can chase us." Yes, I can remember one terrifying incident when MooCow was just a calf, where all the way home from school was chased by rotting dandelion seeds ... yeah, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this small turkey type from Turkey look like the shabby little dolls, some rolling like evil herbs, others sailing in the strings. There is not even the smallest tickle of terror or suspense that can be found here. For unexplained reasons, seed monsters were eliminated by ultraviolet 50 volt lights, although they can walk in broad daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000 times UV energy. As you can see, not much thought has been put into this cow flipping. MooCow says go herbal garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
