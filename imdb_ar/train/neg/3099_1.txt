This film is not only bad, not just vulgar, it's disgusting. Something about Daphne, about a creepy appeal girl, about the whole curse (and I use the word literally) radiates the ugly art that offends the mistress of a brothel. This film makes my skin creep, I regret having genital organs, and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me most about this film is that they used such a good concept. The creature who makes illusions with catastrophic consequences, instead of Clich√© "The Worst Nightmare" and "The Twist of Witch," is a truly wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Thought: The reason for the need to kill the Hopoblin before today is to be attracted to bright lights. During the day, the bright lights do not show well, so you can go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins are graduated from the film studio, yet at least nine of the marigold playful games are played throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> A question for discussion: If you have a strong, hard-hitting and unassailable girlfriend, will you enter a garden game with a military head? explained.
