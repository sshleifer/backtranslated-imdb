Sometimes a new one is made from foreign films. This is a great attraction. They take life and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch taboo topics in society. Too many suspensions and extreme fear of financial failure. Dollar Almighty, determines their choices. Something that calls on European directors. In addition, viewers all over the world are still hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer a delicious bite of the miserable and tormented human body. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry and the flavor of pristine life. This is what the film "To the Left of the Father" offers to curious audiences. A family is locked in the belief that the unity of the family stems from the unit of tradition obedience. However, when the patriarch of the family forgets, the body and blood are filled with wild dreams and dark sensations, and then the two are placed in movements against themselves. Silton Milo plays the role of Andr√© Jr., who seeks to control his inner emotions with his father's stagnant philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simon Spolador is a young Anna seeking to quench the forbidden thirst of family water. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers a lot, but it takes too much time to say. ***
