COBWEB was shown in 1955, an all-star star ranging from veteran LILLIAN GISH silent screen to Actors Studio SUSAN STRASBERG offspring. Set in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this film about you wondering ... ... high drama? Doctor and patient relations? Treatment of shock therapy? No, this howl revolves around who will get exactly the choice of blinds for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm joking? You will not believe your eyes as you watch this wonderful story turned into a movie! Reducing the head-progressive Dr. McIver (Richard Wade Mark) wishes to involve all hospital patients in the design, selection and implementation of new curtains required. McIver's wife played by Marble Gloria Graham wanted to get her two years in this huge job as well. So does the long time employee Miss Inch (Lillian GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if he has already been involved in fine details because of his marriage to JUDY GARLAND. Gifted actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are missing out on this obscure story. As they were thinking?
