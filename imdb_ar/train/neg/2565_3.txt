There are a lot of wrong things in this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was possible to squeeze the first 20 minutes of a movie to just five or ten minutes. The film is short (in the name of God the Merciful) already, but it was possible to compensate for this by paying more attention to the "average lion" (how did Miss Jamal refer to the "wiz" on that?) And work on his sub-plot a little more closely In the main plot. In short, the script has a good idea, but it needs a great deal of redrafting. <br /> <br /> Second, it could have been done without humor. The original version also had some that could have been done without it, but at least there was an almost late idea - here, the belly bulge and urination a lot. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the presentation is a bit self-conscious. I had this original series well enough, as did the first film, but here's just a way, too much. The jokes of Brendan Fraser were slightly above the top (and why did not mention the new "Ursula"?). Other gags with narrator, especially a few interactions near the end, also go beyond common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, greater attention could have been paid to the work of the CGI. At first it was hard to know that Shemp was not a real villa (except for the behavior, of course), but here stands out CGI as a painful thumb. The ideal special effects should tell the story only whether good or bad, and that they at least succeed in this regard, so they are a relatively small problem, but they still exist. <br /> <br /> All that has been said, Christopher Shurman's performance as George is decent enough. He lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher really fails in this specific comparison - so he managed to give George some of the personal depth, which was supposed to be a big mistake in a film inspired by Jay Ward but was not here. Julie as a new Ursula surprised me as better than Leslie Mann. <br /> <br /> Most of the other shows were fairly standard and were not superior in my mind as good or bad.
