Do not spend your money or your time on this pathetic movie under the guise of cinema. When every third word is devoted to obscene language and there is no real conspiracy, and there is a group of old actors who still make presentations of the same history from the past and did not develop in their careers, leaving much to say. I was expecting something better than the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others of the Puertorricans may have is irreversibly eroded by garbage such as Maldeamores. A foul word may be used at a certain moment in a film to emphasize a certain point of view and may be funny or sad according to its context (see Elsa's film and Fred for example) but should not permeate the plot. The film was quite embarrassing and there was not anything funny or even nice about this film.
