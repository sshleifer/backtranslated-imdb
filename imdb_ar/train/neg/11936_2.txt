This movie is really friendly. There is nothing really beautiful I can say about it, along with the moral truth expressed at the height of the film about people in the neighborhood taking part in the fight against crime. Besides all that, the film had nothing: no good footage, no good representation, no good script. I give this movie F and 2 of 10.
