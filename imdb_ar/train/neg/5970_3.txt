Coyote Ugly might be more effective if the filmmakers made it a fun and exploitative movie in an R category (with a lot of nudity). But since PG-13 is what all studios want these days with a movie like this: The PG-13 "tease" flick that is not allowed to go anywhere as far as the movie should have gone. <br /> <br /> The general scenario is that it is easy to guess what the plot point will be 15 minutes before it actually occurs. The acting is appropriate, but the characters are so thin that they can not do anything with them. There were also many points where I looked at a piece of music rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The origins of the only film are amazing female performances. See them in some very tight and elegant clothes ..... but only a lot can be shown due to PG-13 restrictions. There are many divisions and twisted objects that perform some well-designed dances, but there is no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she continues to get crazierly beautiful with age) are also in the film for a very short period of time. The newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and has a deadly smile) and shows some real acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I've ever been able to see in this movie are the boys before the ages when it's not possible to watch the films that have been rated by R. This audience may benefit greatly from the tickle, but the masses will feel annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> Category: First Movie - Women - 10
