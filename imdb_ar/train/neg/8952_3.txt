After hearing about George Orwell's noble masterpiece throughout my life, I am now 37 years old, but I have never read the book. I am completely confused about what I have just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered by the novel, as I am sure, but only through rumors and quotations. Without this limited knowledge, this film was a complete mystery, and even so, I was still uneducated about the 1984 story more than I was before watching it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is stunning, Hurt & Burton offers great performances and the general feeling of the film is bleak and majestic. The prostitute's scene was a very dark piece of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Now for the lower sides, there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on, (at least as far as publicity is concerned), but why and with whom? Nothing shown. There are a few names described about (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what's he doing? From where he came? Where does he work? Why is news reporting changing? Why not be on the front line? Why not eat food in the canteen? What is the drink you drink during the whole movie? Why is it so weak and patient? Why does not his brain be washed like them? What is the deal with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? The story back to back was nice, no rubbing, necessary for those like me who did not read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard-to-follow movie that keeps you guessing what's actually going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been loosely edited and modified and the constant chatter of the Big Brother screens flooding the conversation in places, making it difficult to do what is going on. I agree that this was probably a technical choice but very annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all this nudity? It seemed completely unjustified and I felt that it had been thrown there to compensate for the lack of any coverage of the plot. <br /> <br /> Personally I can not abide by the way Hollywood feels that it has to explain the lines of the story. For the word of these days. We are not simply brainwashing, but this is a few steps too far in the other direction. I can only imagine that it depends entirely on the fact that you read the book because if this movie is a "literal translation" that I have seen many people, I will find it difficult to understand why 1984 is welcomed as a classic. <br /> <br /> There is no denying that it was a light-years before the time and has largely predicted every change in our society so far, (perhaps this was a kind of Bible for the powers that are?), but many Of science fiction novelists did the same without leaving big holes in the story story. <br /> <br /> I think I should have done what I should have done from the beginning and bought a copy of the book if I wanted to understand it. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very disappointed with something I had waited for years to see.
