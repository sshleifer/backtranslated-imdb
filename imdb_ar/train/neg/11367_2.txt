Greg Davis and Brian Daley take some crazy statements by terrorists, add comments by a group of religious right-wing reactionaries, and describe the more radical positions of the most radical Muslims on the planet to anyone calling himself a Muslim, the theology of Islam. Their next film may include an interview with Fred Phelps and the Baptist Church of Westborough, with the addition of comments from some hardline atheists, and their film, "What the world needs to know about Christianity." Do not waste your time and money; just run AM Radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
