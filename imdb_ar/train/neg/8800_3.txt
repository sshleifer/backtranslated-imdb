A set of deleted scenes and alternate pickups, are edited together and add extra sound to make them appear after the first events. The idea is wonderful, but the deleted scenes are left on the floor of the cutting room for some reason and this is extra proof. Since it's not as funny as "Anchorman", let's face it really that the movie was not exactly comedy, so you get a "movie" worse than a movie that was moderately funny. In my eyes, STILL puts a sign or two apartments above "kicking and screaming," or "magic." Cross your fingers that "Wedding Craters" is back to the old school model (not meant pun) <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
