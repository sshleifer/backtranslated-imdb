This movie is another film in a long series of budget, effortless, no talent films filmed on video and give an easy cover to deceive unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what it's like watching this movie, grab a video camera and some red food coloring and photograph yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood in a nightly waste and "attacking" people. Congratulations, I've just made a "dead hood alive"! You can now see if a distribution company will buy from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen some low-cost videos, which have been filmed on videos that show talent from directors and actors or with minimal effort, but that did not happen. Avoid unless Mazushia is real or amused with bad-made horror movies.
