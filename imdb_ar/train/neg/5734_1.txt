This is the type of film that is so bad that you can not stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that "it can not continue to be this crappy until the end ... it's just not able." You know, "worse than jaws 4" type Bad. <br /> <br /> I honestly think I've only seen one movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking about religious nonsense about how you "d end up in hell for lying or watching football. <br /> <br /> Gore? In fact a lot of it. Good-made Gore? In any case. <br /> <br /> The representation is far from bad and all lines are poor cliches. The same applies to a story that consists only of sex, blood and violence, much like other films. <br /> <br /> If you're hoping for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground ?? Keep searching. You will not find it in Live Feed.
