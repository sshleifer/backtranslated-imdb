I am a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this film. <br /> <br /> Haim, the drug-starved child star who is now dried up and is normally a cute child and is accustomed to, and hanging on his back even from small actors / actors will be futile; needless to say they are all very average . It's a wonderful film as a stage to the memory lane of the 1980s - with some exotic clothes and some good shots of the Colorado background and a very harmless plot of stunts. <br /> <br /> All in all, please do not do this Do not waste your time watching this unless you like Movies 80, Corey Haim, or like me, you love Porsches in old school (this movie looks especially great) Very erotic movies to watch.
