This is a tale of intimate hope. I hope you never have to endure anything that awful again. * Cough * Award Razzie * Cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was unfair, unpredictable and inappropriate. I felt as I watched that I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low film standards were before people complained. When I asked for my money at the end of the film, I was informed that I had seen everything "I was not entitled to compensation". The assistant manager told me that many people had complained and actually recovered their money. <br /> <br /> The film's summary is very basic. The dwarf thief steals diamonds and poses as a child to escape the police. Under this smart outline, there is a repertoire of original and dazzling original plays. Firstly. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people hurt by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you want to see dwarfs pretend while threatening children using a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racist jokes? Do you think children say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool? <br /> <br /> If you answer "yes" to any of the above, this film is definitely for you. Although it has been described in some places as "The Worst Film of the Decade", there is probably a movie or 2 worst somewhere. I can not say for sure. We were given this 2 star movie because we all know that a single star review will only indicate a bias by the reviewers and then the review will not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is designed for a less intelligent audience and I can not in a good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
