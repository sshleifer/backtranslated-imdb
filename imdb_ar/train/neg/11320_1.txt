Someone is needed to make a car payment ... This is really terrible ... Jean-Claude Seybourg makes it seem like he went with the wind ... this is an hour I wish to sue in. To return ... Fortunately, Which fell asleep. How can actors of this caliber create this dog? I prefer to spend time watching the algae grow on the side of the fish tank instead of participating in this dreadful file of several types. I now use the DVD Coaster on my coffee table. The $ 5.99 in Walmart is an amount that can not be spent on this movie ... if you really have to, wait until you throw them out after they've been held in stock for years and are frustrated because they will not sell. <br /> <br /> Please for the love of God, let this film die of mystery.
