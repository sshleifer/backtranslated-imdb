I voted for the greatest film in China by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film lovers from abroad, and frankly, I do not get it at all. What I saw was one of the most imaginable melodramas that can be imagined, directed and acted in a bad way, with a complete fit for the hero of the novel. Wei Wei (not laughing) is the young married woman who has suffered along with her pregnant husband (Yu Shi) over the past few years. It is the post-World War II period, and they live with the sister of a teenage husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house that does not have much money (the man was rich when they married). He comes along with the best friend of the old husband (Wei Lee), who used to be a friend of the wife when she was a teenager. She thinks of escaping from her husband with this man, while the husband is still largely oblivious, believing that he may direct his little sister to his friend. This is setup and does not go anywhere you do not expect. I have actually seen a remake, directed by the director of Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. It takes half an hour longer, which is actually very boring, but at least it was beautiful. This supposed classic is very unbearable.
