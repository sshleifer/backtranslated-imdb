Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fritwell) was celebrating in the lake with her friends when her brother fell from a boat and drowned. Her friends in Rachel believe it is time for her to stop beating herself and to blame for something he has not been able to control. So, I grabbed a drink and something to chew and go back to the lake itself that was in the constant Rachel's nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath already started when two friends were scattered before going to the party. This flick is seen in a high school drama where everyone forgot their lines and "winged" ... very badly! Author Gabriel Gabriel gave a more friendly role as a friend of Rachel Liu. Outside of Freitwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty lame characters and some characters who wish to stifle crap by "annoyance". He drew attention to a few players who have the audacity to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Tris and Derek Neves. This is one memorial day that I do not mind losing.
