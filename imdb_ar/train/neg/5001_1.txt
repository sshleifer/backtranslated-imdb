I do not know why I comment on this stupid reality - I happened to watch a few episodes of cable marathon broadcast when I broadcast five consecutive episodes or something, I did not just watch the whole thing (like three episodes) where I was nine months pregnant and about to go to labor On any given day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Brittany, I really do. Money and fame seem to have little sense of dignity. Or that they are self-centered to the extreme. I married a nitwit Federline (well, anyone can make a mistake) and before that "starred" this horrible show about her daily life with him, where she drives a video camera wherever she feels, regardless of whether she is in the face of someone or in the bathroom where Federline stands there. She stumbles on her sexuality without leaving anything to your imagination, I do not care about my role, but I can not help but wonder how you feel about it now when you are divorced. And yes, for her I feel embarrassed. But I should not be. I seem to live a shallow life, though I do not want to exchange lives with her even if I can. Kill TV Road if you like.
