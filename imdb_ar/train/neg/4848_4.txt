I love a good film of war and fall into the category "was there, I did it." So I would like to think that my assessment is accurate (IMHO). After watching this movie just on the DVD, I can safely say it was a pile of trash. There is no way I can recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> I started shouting at me on TV saying "I will not do it" etc ... but I soon realized that having some of the work experience would be a hindrance to that I am very cold. But in the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell, I felt a bad feeling that this film would be in vain ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was no logic to EOD scenes. I only know that the Army team had some more sabra rebels at the other end of the driving wire or the remote trigger. I left my head scratched all the time. Then when you think you know where the story is heading, the Humvee players are driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater going out on Jolie collides with some SAS wannabe contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was very funny. There was no sense at all and made me want to close there and then. Then for them to pull it for a long time they actually tested my patience. I started with the "right contact" and dropped down the hill. If you have a British accent, you have got a bullet but if you are part of an explosive disposal team, it suddenly becomes a wonderful shot and is saved today. Then just as you think it ended for a long time without explanation, without adding anything to the story at all. You just left asking and asking why it is not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had a vintage scene where they beat each other just for laughs .. another scene where I just wanted to end up. You did not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> As my life seemed very dim, the main star came out of the wire to find someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I have ever seen. I challenged every logic and ability to write a good story ... it was meaningless and terrible. I still do not understand why they waste time in it. Then to watch him running down the crowded streets back to the camp, he made me laugh on the ground. Net Comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this whole story is all over the show without really deciding what you want to be. I thought it would be unconventional scenes of stupid ERW but then continued to shadows on shadows that try to be something different. But as much as I tried, I felt bored to death. Everything I wanted to end. It was a chaotic compilation of stupid scenes that were mixed up in a bunch of stupid and senseless scenes and motion. (<br /> <br />) There is no way I can recommend it. Perhaps my experience in the process has weakened in pleasure but even the naive must realize that this is illogical. The only stupid thing about this film is IMDb's artificially high rating ... which must be a 24/7 PR team that seems to be using this website as a way to make everyone think it's good. Sorry people ... not only! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... this will cause you to be charged.
