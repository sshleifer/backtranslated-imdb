I confirmed the director's comment. I did not suspect when watching the film: It's a movie made by a man who wants to play in making a film. This plot is a kind of thing that tricked teenagers come out of when they pass the stage of "I can write a script-winning sitcom / screenwriter." There is a germ for an interesting idea buried there (perhaps because it is a sequel to someone else's film), but it is buried entirely under poorly written, poorly executed and poorly written text. <br /> <br /> The lines are awesome, and the performances are unattractive, but again, I tend to blame the director. He did not seem to have consulted representatives at all about what was needed, but put the text in their hands, directed the camera at them and told them to continue. Who knows, with a little bit of training, these actors could have cleared themselves better (say what you like about film musicians, John Bon Jovi was excellent at Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> <br /> As is the case, the staff have no chemistry at all. A beautiful opportunity to use classical sex and parallels vampires disappears when the blood of Bon Jovi's blood is transferred to the blood of a vampire. She should have bitten him. For you, they should be vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film as well. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two lists, is by accepting your own director. I originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a useless plot exhibit - so, I think the final product could have been worse. but not too much. <br /> <br /> Honestly, as the movies continue, this is badly painted, ridiculous and forgotten. Although abandoned films do not move in a dramatic or inappropriate manner to be amusing. It could have been a small and bloody fun, but the director left with a lot of comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
