"SherryBaby" is a painful and harsh melodrama in Jersey, a story of a young mother who is out of jail after a drug-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life, especially the love of her little daughter. The only reason to watch the film is Maggie Jilinhaal, actress at the top of her career, which fits well with the role and the entire film on her shoulders. This is not enough, because the line of story is very simple and expected, and the emotional focus on the wrong place - I kept asking myself throughout the picture whether I was supposed to be sorry about the former addicts and perhaps the future on the mother drug as wanted by the director and screenwriter, in the middle. Even Maggie Gillenhall's actions could not convince me that I should not care more about the child.
