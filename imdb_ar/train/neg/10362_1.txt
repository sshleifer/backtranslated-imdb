Disney? what happened? I really hope the film was set in the 1960s, as it was in the book. I have really dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more precise adjustment ..... I'm glad that someone might be affected by reading books ..... A guy with red eyes can switch as he is? What's up with volcanic eruptions? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I certainly wish I could know. I can only imagine that they may be closer to the true story of this weak adjustment. This movie needs X'd.
