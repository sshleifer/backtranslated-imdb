This sounds like a strange combination of Withnail and sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not work. Tragedy that changed the name of the US release though .. Keep Apidistra Flying much better than none of the title A Merry War. The acting was fine, the script was okay .. Overall the film was mediocre ..
