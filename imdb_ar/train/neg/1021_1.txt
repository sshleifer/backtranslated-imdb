The film began strongly, LL Cool J (Deed) as a secret police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott of practice, possibly miscast as a bad man?) Commit theft and murder. The act refuses to kill the drug dealer, who ignites a dirty cop battle with a conscience. Other big names (Freeman and Spacey et al) are well illustrated and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a shortcut by Justin Timberlake (Pollack). If we have the opportunity to make a good movie that people may watch over and over, or a movie that teenage girls will go and bet on because of Timberlake, I will choose the first film. Even talented actors have to work hard in their craft. Timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I thought he would make a better offer, given the fact that he was acting gifted for years. All he did in this film was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because the singer sells millions of records and sells the stadiums, this does not automatically translate into the fact that they can work successfully in feature films. Even N'Sync hardcore fans will not be able to ignore the apparent lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> Beside that there are some punched holes, such as the ability of a snap Pollack Sniper and the lethal operation of the warehouse machines. This film was a lot of promise. Totally disappointing.
