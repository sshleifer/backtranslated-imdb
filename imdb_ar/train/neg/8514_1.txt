I give this film a single film, because it really is a terrible film. The audio track of a DVD disc is very bad, it really hurts my ears. But the vision, no matter how far apart it is, shows something remarkable in Italian society. I will not go into details about what was really awful, but the various incidents are not normal at all.

Roberto, the main character, has a whole range of emotions but is too much to be believable. However, the children in the film are mostly 3/4 years old, they are indigenous and the film offers an overview of Italian life ..
