By far the worst film of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto can not save Turkey. I have heard that it was originally supposed to be a movie entitled "The Treasure" but it was changed to "Sharks" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by the "jaw". I think the sharks were in one scene from this movie; the tickets were supposed to sell tickets for the fact that they were included in this "thrill". It does not work at any time when something "good" happens in the film, the crew of the ship roasts each other with a certain kind of beer that was just introduced at the time of making the film. Gee, do you think beer might have been a sponsor? Could it be more obvious? The only time anyone should break beer is if they get through this thing. This is enough reason to celebrate.
