Bad actors, bad photography, intermittent dialogue, shallow characters, but once again the assumption was bad in the first place. Basically, an infernal 11-year-old winged check is being bullied because it has very little money. Of course, the 11-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, a check for $ 1,000,000, and even the frustration of three disgruntled idiots, reminds us of the three dresses. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake, an annoying, hateful boy, decides that when he writes a blank check by a complete stranger, he will benefit from the situation as best he can. In other words, he wanders around a bank, <br /> <br /> handing over a check in his printer, and miraculously coming out with a million dollars in cash. It seems that Preston is also able to reach amazing speeds on his bike, given the fact that the man driving the Jaguar after Preston and his ten speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped into a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there must be a hot heroine. In this case, our hot hero is an FBI agent who goes back to Preston, 11, and dates back to the age of 17. , Nor his slow dialog box, such as "The only other way I can think of staining a cat is to hold on to the butt hose and then pick up the fur." The whole truth was that no one in the entire film realized that the FBI did not curse people indiscriminately. What he failed to explain is that Preston uses the nickname "Macintosh" to disguise as a businessman of some kind. Of course, the FBI finds this intrigue and sends the heroine of our youth after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old intelligence for the first time in screaming when lobsters fall on his face, then treats them with hamburgers, and ends up with a ridiculous laugh across a cement area where they run water from the ground. Our heroine failed to realize during this full adventure that the FBI fugitive is slipping and slipping completely behind him, making his way to the Preston limousine, with a one-dimensional driver who never fails to provide a cheap third class laughing that everyone in the family can suffocate. <br /> <br /> In general: 1/10 is very gracious for this film. I do not see how it only has 4.4 / 10.
