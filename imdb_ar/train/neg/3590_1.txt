To what extent can someone drown while trying to restore old glory? ST: HF will be happy to introduce you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing what Star Trek has done well, do not see it. <br /> <br /> Fast writing -podge, portraying actors for their weak characters, and most of all, the design work is bluntly straightforward. <br /> <br /> Like watching powerful interviews, do not look here! Like the strong position of the Union? Forget it here! Starfleet makes fun of hackers who wear SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> As a seemingly weak captain shifts around the credits of the opening show and within two minutes, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange an experiment with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No, not even uniforms, for good. They are too small or too large, their hoops are shrunk to crates, and TNG Seasons One and Two are mixed up with season 3 and DS9 uniforms. Strict discipline and tradition of any of the original copies in the lack of this production down to be processed! The only good thing about this show is its own graphics, which seem to be getting a bit better with each season. Well, I get it back. Who uses CG that is unskilled? Designers of this offer. <br /> <br /> Do not bother him, it will hurt your sense of Star Trek, as he did to me. Even throwing at previous offers can not save this disaster. <br /> <br /> I cried publicly when I saw this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and rupturing my head. This is bad.
