A friend once asked me to read a script of his own chosen by a film studio. To say that it was one of the most incomprehensible and incomprehensible texts I have ever read will be too little. Yet I never told him. why? Because in a world where movies like "While She Out" can be lit in green and attract an Oscar-winning star such as Kim Basinger, a script that lacks personality, content and common sense does not guarantee that it will not sell. <br /> <br /> As many other reviewers have pointed out, "While Abroad" was the film "A Woman in Danger" which was badly written and misused a Basinger housewife who was caught by four unlikely covers on Christmas Eve . Every legitimate fist, from weak dialogue and bad behavior to sudden lapses of logic, but Basinger is an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are some of the things that amazed me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how much supposed to believe that her husband is jerk, mess house with toys. How long has it become child abuse to make children pick up on their own? <br /> <br /> 2) The ethnically diverse bands are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only ethnically balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Definitely a stupid movie. But also the endless "excitement" in which she sat, where women were portrayed as the weightless victims of men's sadism. Oh stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman get the best in her tormentor. <br /> <br /> 4) Loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although one of the former reviewers has written this phrase, I really believe that this movie should be renamed "The Red Toolbox of Doom."
