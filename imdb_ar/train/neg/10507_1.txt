Well, I and a friend hired this a few days ago because we love to follow B movies because we do it ourselves. Anyway, the cover had a strange blood and looking naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is no way to fail this movie! right? Error!! It just looks like such waste! There was no story in fact, the dialogue was terrible (was there anyone? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really lacked any kind of personality ... the effects were awful .. and what happened with these Long technical shots of frightened people running about not doing anything .. with heavy footage of the eyes and things? We were sitting in the whole movie waiting for something ... nothing happens ... but no ... "Oh, here comes the nymphs! Great! Oh ... They accept ... Again ... Now for violence! ... nothing really happens ... again ... Oh, now running ... and the raiders of the eyes ... again ... Oh, heres Tom Savini! Oh ... Matt ... true .. Well, maybe now something wonderful or even interesting will happen .. No .. Oh! Awesome! Head broken! The end ... Oh crap .. "Finally, since I'm very full of myself .. I'll tell you this! Give me a car, six actors, a strange-looking house, Tom Savini, two naked girls with toothpicks and buckets of blood and I can make the coolest movie I've ever seen ... I made a zero-budget film in two days with better effects, better representation and better text than This ... What does this guy Johannes do? It's easy to make great movies, it might be great ... I'm really upset !!
