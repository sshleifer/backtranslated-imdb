Schizophreniac: The White Mangler Another example of what happens when you get a group of uneducated people together to make a horror film. Any kind of representation, production, story, FX, etc ... comes out of the window trying to create a "shock value". Now do not get me - I consider myself a taster for "shocking", best / oddest / best films - but it's still good to see some talent from a person involved in the film. <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac chronicles the life of Harry Russo - a strange drug addict who takes death orders from the rubberized Rantriukuist doll. He spends a few paragraphs killing prostitutes and other random people, yelling about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (this is the "whore" for those of you who do not speak New York - ... and how) wants to rape them in the ass. There are a few weak dead scenes, a little nonsense, some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing you did not see in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only redeemable thing I can find in this backward film is Often (unintentionally?) Hilarious cries of our main man, Harry. Constantly touches on the desire to kill everyone and do it in the rear, and it becomes very comical after a while. In fact, I feel almost tempted to believe that there is supposed to be some kind of erotic sexual attraction to this film, with all the talk of the ass and continuous shots of Harry running around with his departure from the Hong Dung. In all honesty, this joker is more pedantic in this film, then the few chicks that show some T-and-A (some are full, in good condition). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is moderately amusing as a one-time spectacle, but I can really recommend it to those who want to be able to say they've seen a film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing in this trash ... 3.5 / 10 generosity
