I was not terribly impressed by Dante's first season appearance in Homecoming. It was not a horror story, it was a smart political statement with Undead. Solenoid is the story of a virus that has been launched around the world and which is replacing men's sexual motives with fatal tendencies towards women. The episode begins with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man is caught when the female bodies are discovered at his home. I suppose this should show the onset of the outbreak, but this is not clear because this has never been reconsidered. The episode continues for a while with the presentation of the characters Blah Blah. It sounds wonderful and mysterious, but the stars of the episodes get worse as they come to their sad and unsatisfactory end. Worst episode. Well, except chocolate.
