Have you seen a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manus: hands of fate" dragged more than "dukes". I had more fun in the giant plot holes than the movie ever gave me. Let us touch on a few ... <br /> <br /> There was a remarkable death of text and birth when Shiv spoke to the Dukes and did not respond to him. He ignores and moves, because Knoxville or Scott does not know what he is talking about (nor us). It was as if the engine had died and was restarted. <br /> <br /> The few times General Lee flew into the air were not exciting. Nothing I did not see in the television series. Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part is when Bo was upset by Luke for stealing the girl he loved. The only reason this works is that the script has already abandoned it (though almost). The rest of the time seems far away and forced. <br /> <br /> The tone of Sean William Scott is terrible (or non-existent). <br /> <br /> She hated the performance of Willy Nelson. Were the bad jokes supposed to be good? I wanted to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson comes across beautifully on the big screen. I really felt like one of the best actors in the film. This tells you how wonderful this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the movie, I was walking around with Boss Hogg and the villains to settle each Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his partners. The nuclear bomb was enough. <br /> <br /> This is not meant to be a coherent deconstruction of the film, but to be discouraged from bad writing and to implement what could have been a really sad film. <br /> <br /> If we can only erase and start again ...
