I went to see the war on a whim and expectations very low. The film failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I do not mind stories that extend to credibility - remember the era of fire? - But I expect to be internally consistent. The film jumped from a howl to a howl without stopping breathing, all of which interspersed with special effects that were much delayed than the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A Sophie warrior turns from Korea, turned into the curiosity of a Caucasian antiques dealer and appeared like deus ex machina to pull out the unhappy fans of another mess. A special FBI agent seems to be fully rewarded for the old Korean folklore because of the excellent "supernatural divide" of the Federal Reserve - which has reached this point. Kissing lovers on the deserted beaches where someone yells "I did not mean that this never happens." A new pair of dead Koreans who died like star lovers. Mysterious pendants, anonymous hordes of robotics (owes much to Peter Jackson's sparrows) and the snake wastes a lot of time in the roar that every time its chosen prey is at hand comes something that distracts our attention. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is horrific, the representation was wooden and the effect of all, to be honest and accommodating. However, for me was the moment of coronation in the end, after the end, when the music was the final appropriations - Arirang! This is similar to closing Akira Kurosawa's song "Ran" with a Karaoke show of My Way way - and let me be clear that I do not in any way compare director Kim Borysawa. <br /> <br /> In short, I indulge in myself, a pale set of unrelated clich√©s and narratives, which may appeal to the melodramatic meaning of the popular culture of the Koran, but the price of the ticket should not be for any serious filmgoer - or even filmgoers Serious. I would suggest that this goes beyond cinemas altogether and goes directly to the video, but I'm not sure it is worth it so much.
