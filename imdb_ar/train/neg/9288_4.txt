Dead Half Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a big B hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct follow-up to the video, an action film that loses nothing, but does not have the ability to win anything. It is less entertaining than the first: in all aspects. But it is worth a look though. If you like motion movies or just something to watch during the popcorn session; if you also want to watch the former WWE stars on the screen or even if you like watching the sequences, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, and I think he did not arrange for that position. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing quite far away. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, Sony's production can not be great. Cinematography was a disaster but the general trend was acceptable. Whatever, just watch it if you want. If you see, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose too.
