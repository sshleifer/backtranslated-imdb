Laura's model in South America was kidnapped by a gang from her hotel room and taken to the forest. Demanding a huge ransom for her release. Peter was hired to get her house safe and there was a bonus for him if he could return the money as well as the girl. Peter is escorted to the forest by helicopter with Jack's friend. They try to give the kidnappers fake money for Laura, but the plan is terribly wrong and they have to rescue the helicopter. The helicopter was shot and must also be rescued (not going well). Roaming also in the bush is a demon of some kind. In fact he is just a naked black man with strange big eyes and a problem breathing. Begins to kill a few of the hijackers and does not escape Laura except by some primitives. The rest of the film is really blurry. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a fan of Franco Franco, and in fact so far this is the only second movie I have ever seen, but so I can say that this is not really one of his best efforts. Movies continue very slowly without much happening at all. Everything could have been easily edited on a 25-minute TV show. There are lots of very long shots of people walking in the forest that could have been lifted directly out. <br /> <br /> The Devil Hunter is ill-lit (Infact I do not think was lit at all), badly dubbed, acted badly and slowly for some reason did not carry me. I think the main reason for this was some bad scenes with joy. For example, Laura's scene in the street is clearly filmed on a real street where crowds of people stopped staring at the camera directly while filming. Another funny scene has a gang that has been killed, hanging in a tree falling in blood while one of his friends stands under his scream directly for what seems like minutes. Then for no reason at all, the man in the trees falls and hits the man beneath him. We have to see first to believe. Then of course there is the actual devil. He is just a naked black person, although he has huge eyes, but he has a very foggy vision. <br /> <br /> The movie was connected to a very scary video in the 1980s here in the UK and banned. Now why I had no idea. There is very little nonsense at all and it's hardly a horrible film. Minus nudity which I would say that PG can almost escape. The only thing I can think of is that it has not actually been seen and added to the original list because of your verbal talk. <br /> <br /> There is no great reason to watch this movie really unless you are a great Franco-Ges fan. There is a lot of nudity to keep you from sleeping, and also some very bad scenes that you can laugh at well, but other wise to say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in a forest. Maybe it would be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
