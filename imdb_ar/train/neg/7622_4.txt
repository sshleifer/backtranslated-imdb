One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually committed to expressing joy even in the least attractive films in the TCM Library because this would explain to him the glorification of the "virtues" of this "charming" film during his presentation when I saw it on cable television. Since any old IMDb movie gets a "classic" status from a number of defeated amateur reviewers, I thought there was an urgent need for a more honest review of this film. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's "shop around the corner." Despite all my shredding with "I've got a mail", it still outperforms it as a new image in every imaginable way. The flaws will be more obvious. <br /> <br /> From one of the series "Nice Encounter" that I can remember seeing (a sad attempt at "humor"), the film will go wrong on its feet and never come back This "musical" is qualified only as one in the weaker sense of the term, there is a set of musical numbers that can be forgotten immediately, and Judy sings "I Do not Care" Her Christmas song in the store is probably one of her best numbers here: Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but it seems to have been a failure: the role was originally June June Allison and Judy Certainly not able to fill the shoes of the old part Margaret Sullivan Van Johnson also turns into a nice performance of the second kind Jimmy Stewart.Nets never achieve the chemistry of Stewart / Solavan or even Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This movie knows (some) notes, but not music. It does not seem to really understand why the original works and feels the need to add another potential interest to John John's personality to unnecessarily complicate things. Replacing a new version of the original subplot in infidelity is a penetrating plot device involving an invaluable violin. It is almost embarrassing to see and feel as if it may have been removed from a loop by Three's Company by someone with DeLorean and a flow amplifier. It's really just an excuse for Keaton's toughness. Even the large-scale scene between the romantic performances is bad to deal with. After watching both films, you will understand why they call it "Lubitsch Touch" and not "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and re-watch the original movie or one of Judy Garland's previous films unless you are one of the outstanding characters who enjoy watching a wonderful star fall to the ground.
