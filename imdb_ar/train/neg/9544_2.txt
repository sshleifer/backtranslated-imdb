I did not enjoy this movie. I thought the acting was not good and the story was boring. An old 20-year-old computer saves the day? I thought this was a bit elusive, even for the film. I could not figure out why they could not just turn it off, and why not take a heavy hammer to it. <br /> <br /> It is shameful, but after the original film of the 1980s, you were expecting much more than what was actually delivered. This film could have been the 21st century version of the old film, was not. If this is what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer did not appear to make a day, it would still be, in my opinion, very cheesy.
