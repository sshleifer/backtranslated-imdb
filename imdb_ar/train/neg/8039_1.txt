This reckless film is a piece of crap and boring like the complete repetition of the house. For everyone who wants to watch a terrifying, sexy and cool horror film, they should not think about watching this group of reckless work. And - in my opinion. I have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) Bad script 2) Bad script 3) Bad script 4) Bad behavior 5) Bad redirection Last but not least bad text. I mean I do not like grumbling about every movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. This film must be blocked in a box, closed and drowned in the sea. So please do not do something like this again, please, please, please!
