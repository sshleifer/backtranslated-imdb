Well, dear friends, expected to watch a serious movie buff all kinds of movies, bad as well as good, this movie has put me into the test. I will not do words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. Sissy Spick has never done brilliant anything better to make this film better. In fact I asked myself why I was so bothered seeing this rotten film? Why waste my time and money on something I thought was bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a fan of movies, so I can not avoid what should be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what's wrong with this amateur film, only to say that the quality of acting was, politely, subpaar. A serious film buff might want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Other. Stay at home, do not waste your time, read a book, take a home business or yourself a good sandwich.
