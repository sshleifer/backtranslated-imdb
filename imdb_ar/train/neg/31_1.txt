This is the biggest insult to TMNT at all. Fortunately, officially Venus is not found in Canon TMNT. There will never be a female tortoise. This has been taken away from the tragic tale of 4 of the unique mutants for males who will not have their own family, and there is nothing more. The biggest mistake was crossing the Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible loop; the turtle sounds were wrong and all acted out of her character. They could have done better, better designs, animation and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not care about this people ... it's worth it. Flap was slow lips and abnormal appearance. They respect the slicing completely. The main baddie and some dude dragonlord were tacky. Turtles looked trite with things dangling from their bodies, what was the thing about the rap thigh? Illusions carved silly appearance !? <br /> <br /> If they look natural, act in character and get rid of Venus, get rid of the sounds of the stupid cartoon child ... and the best writing could have been good.
