Anyone who has seen some Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing to get rid of at the planning table. So, when Lara moves madly into Patty's house and starts systematically to drive her street vendors, I do not blink. When Lara eventually intensified her activities to threaten poor Patti, and dared to do anything about it, she shook me. As you see, on the LMN planet, people do not behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the work going. Only on the planet LMN can someone have a homeowner who is thrown out of his house by his tempting powers !! Poor Patty - she was very trusting only, Lara got rid of her drug, and then there was a big fight at the top of the stairs, a syringe full of deadly stuff being injected into someone's stomach, and a body bag coming out the front door. the horror! <br /> <br /> But, take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll get. On the probabilistic scale, I give this film 95/100. Make a large selection of popcorn and get some apple slices as well. You will understand later.
