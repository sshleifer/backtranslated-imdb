Freddy's Dead was the brightest thing to do after the fifth movie disappointed. I started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie in the epic is silly but at least original. Some pictures are so breathtaking. The story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zan) dating back to the city to meet her evil father is a unique story. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is just another cartoon designed to draw children to the stage. She has a group of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who often look and walk like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end, it's just a childish clownish entertainment. <br /> <br />
