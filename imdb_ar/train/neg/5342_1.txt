Rachel, Joe, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all in the lead here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I am a big fan of the TV show. The rocks of their music are all very talented! I also have one of the wonderful grounds for SARCASM !!! Very weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even performed correctly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so bad for the incredible 8 of the S passionate club lovers. They thought they could do it better. And they did. The world invaded. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "The Chubby, Ugly Who Started a Band" should thank his lucky stars who left them when he did. One of the worst movies ever. Beware of this movie! Do not go and see it! You will not laugh! You will cry! 0/10 RJT
