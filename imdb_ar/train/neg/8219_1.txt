I'm the type of person who always moves to the horror section when I choose a film, so I took five eyes. I was disgusted by this film and I thought there was no storyline and no benefit that you could enjoy it. It made my skin crawl to believe that people love to watch movies Which encourages violence only for hell, it's a low budget and very nonsense! I think I can do better myself. The camera was bad, the picture was bad and the sound did not reach zero, and I thought it was a little bit like a peep off the piston which the project and it did not work at all was wrong.
