I grew up with Scooby (kinda restart from where you are) I hate snobby, I love Daphne, and I feel that she is not complete with a whole gang. But this is sad, Scooby Doo is a comic puzzle solution - not quite bad anime spy. I love "what's new", they have been forced to give Daphne at risk a shift at some point :( and try to lose sex-related jokes * for many generations, but this "get idea" is inappropriate and should not be named Scooby's attachment, They tried to do something lame with the main song, now I'm going to watch my DVD from Scooby Doo, where do you wash the dirt of this new series of my eyes?
