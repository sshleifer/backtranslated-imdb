I thought the movie was good in the parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film was good. The camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it because they did not cover the actors completely. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the film were not really great and we do not expect much in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> The Dialogues were not logical, I do not think they were too smart. <br /> <br /> It felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogues, but they failed miserably. It seemed as though they had made many scenes among the actors put in order, and had no meaning to the story. <br /> <br /> The entire movie only displays the code and caine. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste of time, its a movie ok, but not gr8
