This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... It's funny to be bad .. All the time I was watching, half the music started and the doctor started dancing .. (I saw porn with a better plot) when Raptor was trying to get into the door, I think someone was throwing a plastic doll at the door from about two feet away. But as I said it was very bad you need to watch it so you can see how bad it is for me to explain that it will not do anything compared to watching it .. I do not recommend renting it but if it comes to watching TV for only 30 minutes to see what I mean. I could not see more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit in everything, you will find some good will
