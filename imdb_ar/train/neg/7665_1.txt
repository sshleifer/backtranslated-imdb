Frankly, I can not be bothered to spend my time writing about this teacher of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He is capable of throwing many useless plots into the air with all dropping them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. It completely shames the classic computer game it is supposed to be based on being a complete failure in all aspects of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if this is what you are already doing (I'm thinking about rectum) here, what do you do on the floor on a manager's chair?
