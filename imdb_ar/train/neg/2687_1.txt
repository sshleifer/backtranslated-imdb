Eleven out of the "great", eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of boredom, sophistication, waiver, self-indulgence. Treats to people of all states. Youssef Chahine from Egypt gives "Hip Hop Hooray!" L terorism in his amateur part. Across the Green Line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a volatile announcer. Alejandro González Iñárrito from Mexico focused on the twin towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Bean does not know that there were no buildings under the mall at 9-11. Shouhi Immura of Japan ignores everything. Claude Loch focuses on a trivial and trivial affair. Ken Loach of the UK focuses on Chile. etc
