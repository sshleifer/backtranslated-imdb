(Vandals) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie, after I heard it clever and intelligent. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film was acceptable: to visualize the way in which the relationship between men and women develops, through all the problems and difficulties two people living in a large city can live. What made me hate that the whole movie was two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so topical that it seemed, by describing the problems that the couple had to solve in one day on a daily basis, became ordinary and boring. <br /> <br /> Second, the overall stagnation of production, with dialogues that were barely understood. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
