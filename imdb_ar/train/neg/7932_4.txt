My dear, what a disappointment. I have been watching Westerners on British television for decades, and I was not aware of this until it was introduced yesterday - most of Scotland's western population comes every few years or so and usually deserves to be seen again. <br /> The colors were rich and the outside collections were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments that have already been made. I felt several times off, and finally did, halfway, something I barely do. <br /> <br /> Scott Zeytia seemed unusually attracted to the two girls, two of his side companions were annoying and the Mexican was the thief. I have a feeling that the uniform was 20 years old or too long, and that was not the thing that upset many other westerners. <br /> <br /> Maybe the situation was better in the second half, but I could not bother waiting and seeing.
