Poor Toby Hooper. Take out all the time the classic horror "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything he has done has been terrible. Maybe this is the worst ... that's what a lot says. It's about a man (Brad Doriff) who has the ability to make things (and people) set fire or something like that. Hardly the original idea (anyone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally, everything is wrong! Pathetic representation (even Dourif!), Asinine script, audio production values, crappy special effects ... all bad !!!!! Must miss ... Not so good for laugh.
