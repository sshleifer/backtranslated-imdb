I waited nearly 25 years to watch this film, believing it might be a less appreciated work, it is no longer a high-quality animation. He starred as one of the worst filmmakers of all time and was based on a pet series of children's books, and was produced by Disney Studios. What could be wrong with that? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not all. Vincent Price is regarded as Ratican and Henry Mancini in the film. The price is wickedly fun, and the Mancini is more professional than the materials you deserve. They bring the chapter to a project that belongs to ambiguity. <br /> <br /> At the same time, while the rest of the film, while filled with inappropriate adult attitudes, still suffers from a completely boring scenario, very poor audio, awful songs, and lazy animations will not be Took its place in any Disney TV show on Saturday morning in the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> This was a great disappointment for me. It is amazing that this film was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, the independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD's endless run-time. <br /> <br /> The extra star that prevents this from being "awful" goes to Price and Mancini.
