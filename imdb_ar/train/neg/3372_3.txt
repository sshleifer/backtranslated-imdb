He is a pale, brilliant musician. This film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, unnecessarily "opening" it, and suggests the content of the play. The show revolves around a group of dancers who are testing for a job in the musical play B'way and examines their strength and desire to work in this hard line of work that is not always rewarded. Attenborough gives us a new set of hope, assuming they are trying to get a "big break" in the review work, instead of presenting a more assertive mix of characters created on stage as a collection of live Gypsy work shows to show, along with two Of newcomers. The film has one advantage over the play, the opening scene that shows the original test size and the real deflection scale up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how your account for Cassie, which was stupidly excluded in the film). Anyone who can watch the production of a local urban light opera from the play will have a richer experience than watching this poorly designed film.
