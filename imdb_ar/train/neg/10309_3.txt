"CIA Codename: Alexa" is the absolutely terrible rupture of the classic Luc Besson film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film revolves around a woman captured by the CIA and trained and forced to perform a secret mission for them. (Largely the same structure as the story of La Femme Nikita) narrative on behalf of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is the worst in the history of cinema. "Representation" Lamas is just a bad plagiarism for Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal in this film is a great experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting are very bad in this film and sometimes it is laughable. There are a lot of Action movies in the movie, it's ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad horse tail, and so on. The musical result is similar to the recording of David Michael Frank's "Hard To Kill" (1990), which reinforces the Steven Seagal theme of the film. There are a lot of martial arts in the film, and they are well executed for a low-budget American production. Unintentional work and over-representation never give up, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly enjoying myself. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas was like the star of the movement in the early 1990s, but he certainly is not a movement star, and that's why he performs the soap opera and not the thriller movies. My recommendation is to skip "CEN Codename: Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita" instead.
