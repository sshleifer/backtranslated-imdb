This thing is really cool. There is no crack with weight, they all walk around in BG's. The Motion Capture is a great game, but this movie shows that you really need people who know animations to make an animated film. The machine can not do anything by itself. If you think it's a weird movie, you'll find it fun to find continuity errors ... in a 3D movie !!! It is funny watching the princess dress as it moves like something through different decorations. You need graphics and 3D graphics, not data entries that know 3D programs. Notice the connectors, such as the elbows, how they lost the volume and distorted. The person who designed the straps (very good design) was sure when he watched them move, because you can not say they come to life.
