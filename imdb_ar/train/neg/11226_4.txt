I'm kinda torn on DARK ANGEL. The film seems to have been a "lover" of as many people as possible - but there is so little "content" that the film itself makes little sense. I can not really see what the motive or "point" is for this movie - where there is very little information on the autobiography provided in the narrative - so those who do not know much about my house do not know more after watching DARK ANGEL either ... /> <br /> The film mainly tells the last few years of Bettie's march in the design of models of slavery. The entire film consists of a "re-enactment" of some of Bettie's most famous photos and rings. This re-enactment takes literally 75% of the time the movies run, and does not give any rough look to Bettie as a person. The film briefly touches on its short-term legitimate acting endeavors, its subsequent decision to leave "business" and becomes religious - but all this has been largely polished in favor of long scenes of re-enactment. ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not a terrible movie - there is no content for it. The other problem is that the actress who plays the role of Betty really resembles her in far-off shots - it's a banned game. The other thing that angered me was that, although Bettie did a lot of modeling shoots, the only nudity in the film was a short clip filmed in the zoo during the final credits. It is clear that the film itself is a very low budget, but it does what it can and puts it within its limits - so there is no grip from me there. The representation is lovely wooden and memorable of all involved. In fact - the most memorable thing for the whole film for me, is to note that the actor who played the role of Irving Klaw is the real Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the list of cast. I can not say that I highly recommend this unless you are a true Bettiefile and you must own anything about it. If you are so bad - you need to ask for treatment anyway ... 4/10
