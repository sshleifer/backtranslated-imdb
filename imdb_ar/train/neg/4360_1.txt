First of all, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this film. The best review of this kind of cinema can be just silence. A film directed to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to appear "real" and should assume that characters are "real people". An Italian can never think that characters may be "real": they are just "low-light" stereotypes. It gives a very insightful view of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (the plot, the plot?) And the humor does not laugh anyone over 12 years old.
