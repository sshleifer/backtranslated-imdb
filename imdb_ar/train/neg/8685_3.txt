Frankly, my expectations for Bush were small and low. I was expecting a small cartoon series with a lot of fun (but re-phrased and overtaken) Bush's jokes. Obviously, I should have lowered my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was absolutely pathetic. Regardless of the Cheney-Chicking Itting joke, and some massive blows, it was really boring and uncommon. <br /> <br /> Animation was as sophisticated as the 13-year-old flash project. It is shameful that they used the Macromedia product for this, because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush a lot, and I enjoy Bush's joke like the next guy, but it was just a half-hour's criticism of the President in a few moments that were painfully laughable. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That My Bush. <br /> <br /> Pick yourself up, skip "Lil 'Bush" and go to buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That My Bush." You will thank me.
