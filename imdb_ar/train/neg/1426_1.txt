One question: Why? First, the premise is not funny or attractive at all. They use recorded interviews, and they take the sound to move it with the animals that talk about the parts. First, the interviews are not funny or amusing at first, and even if they are, I'm sure they would be much more entertaining to be presented as they were originally, without turning into cartoons. How can you add any joy to it? CBS (CBS), which was a regular way for me to relax after the stressful days of work on Monday, was running and I found it. Of course, the sitcom would be a replay anyway, being a summer, but seeing these episodes again would be more entertaining. I tried to give a "CC" chance. I really did. When I started, I figured, well, maybe it would be funny. Both. Then he continued. It was half an hour long. <br /> <br /> I can almost see if there is a purpose, whether the interviews were presented in their entirety, and they contained points for them. But no, it was just one-line clips, cut and pasted very quickly. It was like the horrific, terrifying version of "Robot Chicken" in Cartoon Network. I was not a fan of the CBS sitcom 'The Class' now canceled. During that time, it was half an hour from the squad that I was going to face. But if it is for me is to select a full season of it or three other episodes of "Creatures" .... let's just say that I will take the "chapter". Considering that it took a few hours since it was broadcast, I came here to see that I was the first to comment ... I think this is a good sign that no one has seen it, and it will not last long. Cartoon Road.
