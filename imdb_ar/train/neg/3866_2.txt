I thought this film had no meaning at all. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you on your wedding day to your cousin ??? I will be sad !! It was classified as a comedy but I did not find it funny at all. I thought he often found cheap laughs and took it. I usually love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee plays a starring role in another disgraceful show, which again proves that class and decent ethics are irrelevant in today's society. He had a complete lack of taste and I despised movies like this. I understand that people will defend this film and its morals because it is "just a movie," but I still stand ready that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I do not try to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, because everyone deserves their own opinion, and parts of this movie were fun, I just say that in real life, the characters acting in this film were doing something shameful.
