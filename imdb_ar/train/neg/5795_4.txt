The film "Lies" tells an affair between an 18-year-old student and a thin married man of 38 with a pair of novels that spends half the time on screen in nude sex and hockey and the other half curled by pathetic naivet√©. A story that looks more than just an excuse for sex scenes. With poor production value, including clear health devices and the fake soft sex of a story that is a mix of chaos between comedy and drama, "lies" soon become a major nausea in advertising. With almost 2 hours running, translations, and a little bit of substance, "lies" simply is not recommended. (C)
