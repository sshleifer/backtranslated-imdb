From the creators of Shrek ???????? Well, I've caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> Now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> This means Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were very good but the film was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was for children only. Adults can not really love this thing. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes for adults. I bet children understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Even so, I like this thing. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed. 10/04
