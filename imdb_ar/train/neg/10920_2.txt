This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator, who said the special effects are fine. I found it very bad: it was not realistic and they were so fake that it diverted attention from the actual story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is why I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "group". They do not assign themselves to defining the group or what distinguishes it. This also makes it unclear why they are looking for him in California, while the film is being shown in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you are filming a movie filmed in the desert, do your best to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the old celebration - seems to have been filmed inside the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> The level of motion was constant throughout the film, neither up nor down, nor peak. It made the film seem short, and this is definitely a supporter of this particular film.
