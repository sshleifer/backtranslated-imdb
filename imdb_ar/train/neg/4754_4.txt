I love the original. It was fantastic and would always be. Strangely though, I was looking forward to seeing re-making. I usually object to recycling because there are too many of them, but that's what interested me. I really enjoyed it to get started. Cayenne's glossy, as usual, exists if I could stand by him. It was very smart how it was updated and was working. What prevents this from being really good is the last seven minutes. It is quite far from the origin, yet in fact it is no longer smart and just annoying. The finish was originally fantastic! Much tension was built and was incredibly clever! this is? This tension does not grow but in frustration because they seem to have decided to make a gay Ken figure. It was if they were trying to be very different. Then ... blast! Death of the Law. Roll credits. This film is worth watching for just shows, but those last seven minutes really pull it. Unfortunately....
