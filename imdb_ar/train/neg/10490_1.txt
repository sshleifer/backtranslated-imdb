I noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to be still in school) has given this film a very good assessment, and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer did not see the BBC's 1989 adaptation of this classic novel. The main problem I faced with this release (1999) was Anthony Wye cast as Tom Long. Anthony Wye was a three-times talented boy who shot fame after appearing in the television series "The Choir". I can only assume that he was represented for the role of Tom Long in his excellent acting power in "The Chorus". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" grew up to become a tall young man by the time "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and Anthony failed to convince Tom the schoolboy. It is too far from the imagination to believe that Tom (as Anthony did) will endorse Hatty. In the 1989 BBC version, Tom and Hattie became closer in age and their friendship grew more believable. For the 1999 film, the special effects fail to convince and not any significant improvement in television effects 1989. The representation and implementation of this version is lower than the previous amendment, and all in the whole film version lacked classic classic luster. As a last note, I would like to point out that VHS of the 1989 BBC version is more than £ 20.00, while a new DVD can be bought from this version for less than £ 5.00. Do I need to say more?
