I saw this movie in a real movie theater (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12 years old, I think, and in really scary movies. I remember being very excited to see him because my gentle uncle let us choose the film (and probably will not do it again!) And disappointment afterwards !! Just boring and not scary. The only thing I can remember is Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and it was not that great, just someone I knew. I have seen bad films before, and this film has always been in my mind as the worst. That was what I can remember, one of the most boring and unspeakable waste that connects us to $ 6 a week and is a movie junkie. I've read some reviews that say it's worth watching and I say: "Each one of them is his own," but I will not bother. Not so bad it's good.
