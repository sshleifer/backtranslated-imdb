I will not mention any of the plot, because although it would be highly anticipated anyway, the twist of the conspicuous plot is being presented away everywhere, in the film's comments, in the plot summary here, and even in the summary on my Netflix envelope. Maybe I enjoyed it more if I did not know it. Can. This film contains deceptively good actors, and most of them acted credibly with fairly limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Leslie Ann Warren, Tia Carriri and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller pieces. It was impossible to love William McNamara, but that was clear in terms of design. There were a few nude quick scenes by callipygian Lennor Zhan. But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. Do not any of these actual actors actually read these texts before signing in?
