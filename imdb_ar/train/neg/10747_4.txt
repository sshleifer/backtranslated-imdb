Camp Blood III is a major improvement in Camp Blood II where it often appears in the right places and primitive plot. This time, they ventured away from the parking lot, where the last two films were filmed in a good move because you can no longer hear the cars behind what is supposed to be a remote wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time there is a real TV show and a fake joker to intimidate contestants. This is hardly a new idea, I've watched at least three other horror films with the same exact premise as the real killer shows but at least this is a plot rather than being kicked out with a knife indiscriminately. <br /> <br /> Unlike others in the series, this version is good at least for a few laughs. I liked how there was a successful sound effect when someone was stabbed early and the way Mike Bum hunted behind people like the phantom. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone wants to make a third movie blood camp, I thought it would be better to start from scratch but they tried at least with this one. The mutilated women were half-naked to me, they seem to have tried to maintain continuity by hiring some nerds who will get their clothes for $ 5 as they did in the second film. They still did not get to use a sickle to cut not to stab, but well, it's Camp Country Movie what do you expect? If you like crap movies you'll get some fun from this one.
