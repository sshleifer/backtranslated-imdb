Fred Olin Ray is a poor director, even for B filmmakers, but "Haunting Fear" may be one of his best films. Yes, it hides Bo's brilliant story "Premature Burial" and yes, it's going bad and uneven all the time, but it's also very entertaining. Queen Brink Stevens' cry is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose poor husband (Jay Richardson) plans to get rid of her because he needs the money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many core films dating back to the early 1990s, actually performs best in the film as a mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychiatrist, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Periman in a beautiful scene in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
