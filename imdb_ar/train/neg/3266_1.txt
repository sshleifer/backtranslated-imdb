When Ben (Red Fox) discovers his wife Beatriz (Pearl Billy), he flees with his brother, rushing to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload the woe - only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: Garrison (Denise Dogan). Needless to say, Ben does not take it well and track many complications - including Ben's attempt to get Norman because of being gay by fixing him with a whore (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description seems a more enjoyable movie than the movie itself . <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sambrick, Norman ... Is That You? It was an absolute disaster on the New York Theater. To give the play its merit, I actually saw it in the 1970s as a theatrical production of society - and while no one accuses it of anything other than a shallow farce, the actress played extensively and in this deadly way proved very amusing. It is regrettable that the representatives of this film did not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible cinematic image. Red Fox, one of the most funny comics of the 20th century, is as funny as yesterday's washing, Michael Warren (who later appeared in the television series HILL STREET BLUES for a much better effect) competing with Foxx to see who could give the worst performance, behind. To tell the truth, only Dennis Dogan, Tammy Dobson, and the Hollywood of the Island Flowers have no spark - unfortunately, this is only in comparison with the rest of the actors. <br /> <br /> Not only does the movie perform poorly, it looks bad. According to film tradition, this was the first large-screen effort to be filmed in a video, which was then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me, it appears. The film appears in the form of a bad comedy play of the 1970s to a colorful skyline seen through Norman windows and Garrison's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become funny, but Norman ... Is that you? Not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film with two words: I miss him. Do not buy it, do not rent it, and do not touch it with ten feet. Slowly back slowly and then ran like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Amazon
