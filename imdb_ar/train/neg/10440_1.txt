Unless you are between 10 and 14 (except R), there are very few things you like here. One or two lines of Kenan Thompson and David Kouchner (we should see more) and the Jackson humorist and Guiliana Margolis are as good as they can think of their surroundings, but unfortunately, that's it. A bad plot. Misrepresentation. Worst writing and delivery. The special effects are bleak. As much as the whole situation is a strange and terrifying joke, the important individual positions are all equally appalling. If you take into account the parts of the movement, there are incredible movement sequences in some of the films that make you angry and there are some movies that make you moan. This movie contains only this last type. This leaves a little left. I'm very happy because I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite any noise, I can read and think, so when I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I did not have any expectations, but I was somewhat concerned about entry. However, like the train wreck, one can not look away. Even with no expectations, I was let down. Bad. Not even "very bad, it's a good article." I'm tolerant of bad films, but this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece over CGI'd is in the same company as Earth Battlefield, Little Guy and Jelly. How this is rated 7.2 currently amazes me completely. Brainwashing or accumulating the voting system in one way or another is all I can think of as answers. <br /> <br /> I go ahead but enough to say that night, I've seen the train wreck. I need to go and wash my eyes. 1 of 10
