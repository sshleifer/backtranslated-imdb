This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is no story at all, the gags are reserved for the retarded only and there is nothing else that makes this movie worth watching. In the entire film Freddy (oh my God what a funny name.Ha ha) does not ask himself once how he came from a plane to the middle ground. There are a lot of stupid and funny characters whose names should look funny. For example: Gandalf is called the singer, Sam is called Bobsis ... and so on. I did not even smile once during the entire film. Gags seem to have been made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie might be right for you. Another funny scene: trying to guess the word code for closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the word code is (ha ha): Ruth. So if you laugh at these examples, you might like this movie. For Everyone: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": It's a lot and lots of fun.
