Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his superior responsibility for the Mockumentary subtype has no difficulty in floundering at least, especially because of this very anomalous blow in RPG games. Jokes go beyond lame. There is not enough material for a typical length continuation to steal the SNL (especially corrupt), and much less than 87 horrendous minutes I devoted to watching this driving range. William Cat (America's greatest hero, home) deserves much better. There is one thing and only one person makes the fact that I saw this is worth it in my mind and this is what is posted here, so I just wish to save someone a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> DVD additions: 2 audio reviews; 7 interviews with various team members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> Additions DVD-Rom: 2 Wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: Highlight the eye in the picture in the main menu to see a short scene
