First of all, I'm not an American or a Middle Easterner. Second, I have no religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sports and movies. From now on, I think it would be better for me to offer a neutral and unbiased opinion. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are completely blotchy. This horrific event must be used to commemorate all those innocent people who were killed by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morality. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films was narcotic attempts to score various political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach chip. Sure, we are all sad because this man had a difficult life in his country, but what did that have to do with innocent victims in 2001? Two mistakes do not correct? whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who find it difficult to listen to a partially inseparable Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) Most disturbing is the clip of Youssef Chahine. Obviously he has a problem with logic. He justified the killings because - because America is democratic and because some Americans voted for politicians in power, all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions of their leaders on the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this man real ?? Some Americans do not vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is located; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; the majority do not know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chahine, the reason for all these problems in the world is that there are a lot of people who have this kind of logic. Innocent victims came from the twin towers from around the world. Firefighters, rescuers, office workers, observers and travelers have nothing to do with politics. However, we are not allowed to practice our lives because "some" people think that everyone should choose a side or religion. It is seen as a fair game of extremist politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli sector has demonstrated their victims who were bombed. Another director uses this event to push his own political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me". Sometimes, it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Ouedraogo part is a joke and another political goal. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, Blah, Blah. <br /> <br /> This film distorts the memory of the victims of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> The best thing is TRASH CAN.
