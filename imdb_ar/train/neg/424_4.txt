Yesterday was the Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the full movie version of the "Earth" features of DisneyNature. I think, like automakers, that Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. They may really care about the planet, but I do not know, but I do not think it requires special unity with the word "nature" in it. I know my younger daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who will tell him about my personal feelings about Disney one year old? <br /> <br /> Apart from stunning cinematic photography, Disney was a typical disappointment for me. It is preceded by half a dozen Disney movie trailers, which are packed with Disney's ("Circle of Life" and "Knockout"), excessive music and recycled footage (Disney claims "40% new footage"). I even started to think that James Earl Jones's novel became a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work at Disney and Morgan Freeman in every story Warner Brothers started wearing. I really think that Disney bought some of the natural BBC images that were amazingly accomplished, and I felt she would sell herself if she slapped some orchestral music and recognizable audio clips. <br /> <br /> What is Disney's obsession? Show predators hunt and kill baby animals? There were half a dozen of these scenes, complete with dyeing young people about to get a severed throat. I think Disney needs to realize that animals have a rich and exciting life outside life and the death struggles that attract teenagers in motion movies and who are dragged by their parents to this film. I also realized how Disney stopped pointing out that man had nothing to do with climate change. Are they too afraid of the small minority of deniers who believe they are still a controversial subject? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this option and renting Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature's movies seem to be better done by the British at the moment.
