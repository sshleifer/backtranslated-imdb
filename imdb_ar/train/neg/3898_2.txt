I am very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the greatest filmmakers in post-war Germany, and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces," but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is awake about! The representation is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all smiles like an idiot! -, the pants between Nazi cheerfulness and silly battlefields, the entire film looks as though it was made in two days in the attic. Maybe so it seems that many people are taking this "real art", but for me this film is simply bad and cheap. Compare this to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
