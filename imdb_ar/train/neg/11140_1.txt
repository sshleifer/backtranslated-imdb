I thought I was going to watch a scary movie .. I ended up laughing along the film. In the scene where a man turned into a wolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have 10 times better animation. A low budget, is a convenient comment. I recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a well-heeled film. Her special effects are as good as they should be (human turns into a werewolf). Unless you want to get a good laugh, I do not recommend you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
