Underground Comedy is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I should have known that it would be bad when the box reads "guaranteed abuse" written on it ... which means that filmmakers were concentrating more on your stats rather than making you laugh. <br /> <br /> This film is a mix of amateur actresses, bad characters, and worst jokes. Starting with the pathetic Bat-Man drawing to Arnold Shvollenpecker's painful misrepresentation, it's not funny. The few funny plays are a few and far between - watching Michelle Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but they last long and are ruined by the inefficiency of Vince's show in comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep an underground comedy movie ... bury it!
