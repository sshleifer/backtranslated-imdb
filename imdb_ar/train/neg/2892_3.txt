The naked body of Ursula Anders is one of the things that makes you believe in God. The other two women (especially the person playing the maid) have wonderful bodies too. So why is the top score that I can make for a film of this quality and the amount of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, to reach Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit in an unfamiliar and boring film (but consider that I saw the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American version that probably cuts off a lot of extraneous material) . In traditional Italian comedic tradition, most characters are exaggerated cartoons (army obsessed, "Latin lover", permanently drunk, na√Øve maid) are not funny, simply excessive. Last word: Watch this, but keep your finger on the fast forward button, you need it. (*)
