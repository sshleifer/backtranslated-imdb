When I heard the plot of this film that I simply had to see, I mean the entire cities were wiped out with deadly tomatoes! Sadly the title is very funny as it is. <br /> <br /> Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who has never worn his clothes for SCUBA and Lieutenant Vinnter, who has never been filmed "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Simulated Parashut behind him), a spoof of B-Movies, especially Japanese horror in the 1950s. The film begins with a normal tomato that is discovered by women washing in her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene where tomatoes are supposed to kill this lady, and let me tell you that she does not get anything healthier as the film progresses! To be fair, there are funny moments, for example, whenever the Japanese scientist Dr. Nukitova speaks of his voice as an American dialect, or when the persuasive expert Sam Smith sneaks into the tomato, "Hey, can someone pass the ketchup?" . Equally this film was probably the most entertaining in 1978 where the good concept was so bad. Unfortunately, "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" spoofed films such as 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' have been released and have done this kind of comedy better since then. <br /> <br /> The representation is terrible; there is no continuity in editing, it feels slow and lacks energy. In order for a parody to work, you need a lot of things that happen simultaneously, one by one. The singing in the film seems to be useless, and the ads for the furniture store flickering across the screen are quite strange, even for this film. In the end, however, you can see why this film is a single cult; I can not see many people indifferent to it. Sadly the terrible way would be to summarize this.
