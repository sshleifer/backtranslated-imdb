John Prismman (Michelle 'I should be called Ditech' Lerner) works in the doctor's office as an entrepreneur. His mother (Zelda "Poltergist" Rubenstein) sleeps absent from people who see their thoughts offended him. But it turned out that the film was in a movie, but the lines quickly became unclear as John went to the cinemas to kill her. He urged the man watching the film to do the same thing. Lerner is well ahead of the top, but Zelda repeatedly repeats the lines of dialogue. That gets annoying quickly. But not as troublesome as the two girls who watch the movie in a movie. The horror film fails this film, it is too busy trying to be smart, trying to convey a message and seems to forget that a film tilted should raise a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst type of artery: an art house. <br /> <br /> My estimate: D +
