Well, regardless of the narcotic background images, the information presented here was good. The music I could have done without her (not that she was bad music, just because she did not fit in with this film at all). <br /> <br /> As for the content of the film, the director presents a lot - the lack of a pagan view of the existence of Christ and the amazing comparison of the actions and events of Christ's life in exchange for the lives of legendary characters / gods such as Mithra and Dionysis. Then subtracts the chronology of Christian origins and presents the issue of "OK", but not the ones that blew me away. <br /> <br /> If the director is stuck with the facts and continues with them, this film was good. However, at this stage of the film, it breaks down into a series of personally gratifying attacks on the "Passion of Christ" Mel Gibson and a special Christian school attended by the director in his youth. During an interview with his old manager, (which during the experiment, it turned out that the director was created under false pretenses) I felt that the director was acting childishly. He was asking good questions, but like the film itself, the interview collapsed in an attack on the rules of this special school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> In general, if you're only interested in some information, watch the first 30 minutes or so, then close it.
