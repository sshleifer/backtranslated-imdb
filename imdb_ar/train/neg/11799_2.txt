This could have been a good episode but I simply had to stop it. The British representation was terrible to watch. Did foot makers put their feet in Britain before shooting? At least put foot in England? I do not think any British person had such a tone apart from the comic play of the royal family! Also with English boys ... I do not think that any English boy has behaved or talked or dressed like any English child in the history of the British nation since the advent of Prince William and Harry public. To American filmmakers. There are more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. That means more than one culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but this was so bad I could not see it. Fire looked cool though!
