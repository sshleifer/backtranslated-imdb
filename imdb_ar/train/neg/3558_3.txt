Based on Russell Russell's bestseller, this stunning statue of John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) has little effect. <br /> <br /> Although he does not lack brutal violence, he lacks narrative sensitivity and "characters". <br /> <br /> "Incubus" from the title is a demon with a huge penis shooting red sperm in the vagina during intercourse - or, more accurately, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavet, who highlights his successful career in guidance, is persuasive as a doctor who wonders about the circumstances of the strange attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrific prospects of victims born of satanic offspring are not being considered - nor are any of them seen. It is carrying the public to a slow-moving garbage. <br /> <br /> The reluctance of the scenario to explore the dramatic implications of a fertile hypothesis represents the major problems in this big exercise, Big-Schlong-On-Loose.
