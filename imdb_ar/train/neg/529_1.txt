This is undoubtedly the most offensive "flick of the chick" I have seen in years, if not at all. The writing and descriptions are so full of stereotypes that the film comes close to parody. Before getting out of the theater for an hour and five minutes of this disaster, we have come up with the following themes: Having a child will solve all your problems. The "types of performers" are miserable, and musicians can not be good mothers but throw their dreams to a more traditional lifestyle. Yala is a waste of talented team and some wonderful collections and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Tony Collett that unless she lived a more widespread life, she would end up trembling - "Lonely!" , I felt nauseous. I can not believe this movie made it a theatrical version. It is the type of fare one would expect from the "women's" cable channels I always use when surfing the channel. I am a female and a 35 year old, so I must be part of the target audience for this film, but the boy, do not miss the "evening" his goal.
