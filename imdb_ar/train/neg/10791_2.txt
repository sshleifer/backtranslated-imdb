Awesome movie. If there is one Turkish movie you should avoid watching in 2006, it will be Banyo. What a waste of time. Unlike cheap laughs, this film does not achieve anything, Nada, nothing, nothing. The dialogue is cheap, and the sexual cliches are over. The director needs to watch more movies before trying to make his films. Red-headed women are examples of what the actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to behave, this is an ideal example of misconduct. The only good thing I can say about the film is wait, wait, wait, there is nothing good I can say about it. I have to really hate to write about it so much. Geez!
