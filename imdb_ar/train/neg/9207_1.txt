This movie is sold for $ 1 in Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I've lost anything to watch this movie, except TIME. I enjoyed Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and had a great performance as it was a terrible scenario. The story revolves around university students who have decided to play the game Mades & Monsters, only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and his parents are advised to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice festival with a romantic heart. Once he starts playing, he stops loving her and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the film that are displayed about the former World Trade Center and also on the observation deck and roof area. It is sad to see this part of the film where many people died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good film, except for trying Tom Hanks to keep the film higher than the entertainment level.
