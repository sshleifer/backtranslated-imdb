I do not know who got the idea that the orcas revolve around killing people and destroying things and destroying them for revenge but my god is ridiculous. Sure, Orcas is not the cold killer that makes this movie ... Orcas very smart, do not make mistakes, but I strongly doubt that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I must say that all that I came out of this film was entertaining for its usefulness. So you are at least somewhat amused by it. I personally recommend going and watching jaws if you want to watch an Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you are like me and want to laugh at this far from realism, then I go ahead. :Dr
