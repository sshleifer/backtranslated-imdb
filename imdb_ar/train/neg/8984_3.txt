If you want to watch a movie that emphasizes elegance on the essence, it suits you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful in the SEE, but there is a precious little material, unless you turn off mysterious and manipulative threads of love. This may be one of the famous "chick flicks" you've heard about a lot. <br /> <br /> We are about to finish this film before anything happens: Ulysses (Jordi Mola) goes out to the sea in search of tuna, never returns, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and his son to defend themselves. And then, within six minutes of the time of the angry screen, they buried Ulysses, married Martina again, and her son grows up in the middle of childhood. This rapid change is volatile, to say the least, and very dirty: after 40 minutes of loitering more or less, we suddenly become a full-length melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called the speed of the troubled narrative. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulysses returns (as in Ulysses, the traveling superhero, do you want to get it?) and returns to Penelope (Wateling) only to find that she is married to Sierra (Edward Fernandez) The inexplicable rich (what does he do to win all this dough?) Which inexplicably holds crocodiles as pets. When Martina asks, in great anger, Ulysses about his absence, tells her that he will take her to Sumatra someday and understand everything. <br /> <br /> Here's the thing: he does take her to Sumatra Island. The reference only dies somewhere in the script. It does not explain the fact of his whereabouts and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He does not donate himself as a decent man, and the film does not fill the holes in the plot that besets us for at least half of the film. I can only assume that the director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the lines of the story with the mysterious evidence (fish, reptiles and the sea) that he offers through cinematic photography and elusive dialogue. It just does not work. The story of the "arc" in this film will end up like a wobbling laundry rope. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Mola is a good actor, but I could not buy his first movie like any kind of hero (which was supposed to be the original Ulysses). With a damp sensitivity, he publishes a short section of Virgil's matching hair nearly 2000 times and each time Martina provokes an explosive orgasm. This man must be hired to activate meaningless marriages. I'm sure Virgil will be impressed. He did not get that much, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This poetic "device" appears prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was a sexual reflection of the song "The Famous Siren" by Ulysses (ie beautiful women singing in a most seductive manner) ) The sailors, who had their fate if they answered, well, call sirens). If this is what Bigas Luna means, you can see the problem - it offers a twisted symbolic attempt to grab and grab High Art. Again, it does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful young actress and magnetic, but she gives us a character here that does not seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. Beyond me how can you fall in love with a man wearing a sign to rent on his face (as in a vacancy), oil-style poetry of the 1960s and very similar to seagrass, one of those trendy beards of the eleventh century (As you know, the growth of four days, no more and no less.) It was supposed to be a kind of dreaming men (I think), but those eyes of his counterpart suggest he may suffer more than excessive exposure to acquired text. < <br /> <br /> But, do not despair, this movie is great to look at, do not just try to connect the points to the red herring or T in what you hear in the way of dialogue. You can do a quick loss of shipping in this film (especially in the first forty minutes) will not miss much.
