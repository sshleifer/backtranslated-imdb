Chitin Natividad, one of Ross Meyer's best known actors, plays Chastity Not, a woman found to have breast cancer, so she went to South America to get some special fruit (crocazella?), Which is supposed to have healing powers. After going into some of these fruits (which appear to be plastic bananas on stalks), chastity has some magic magical powers that make it a super hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of underwear as a mask. In writing, all this sounds good. In implementation, well, it leaves a little more to the desired level. Chastity seems to have a pub and a common local annoyance as it removes its commercial activity until it is haunted by some strippers (including Haji, and also Russ Meyer's fame). Of course, she fights chastity again under the guise of Double D Avenger. Watched her spin on the kind of "Wonder Woman" to change her clothes and lose her balance also because of the excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame entrants fly like there was no tomorrow. With the stunning song running over and over again, it looks like a great show of the 'Live Thriller' series of the 1970s with adult content, although this is not uniform, but it is likely to escape the PG-13 at worst. Perhaps it was a blessing kept by dim stars covered well. This makes Duste Wichman's films from Chesty Morgan look remarkably positive in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman But what about it. Too stupid, I do not buy another film with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 of 10.
