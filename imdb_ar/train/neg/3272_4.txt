I will say one thing about this film: There are no lulls. You can not bored watching this. The problem is that it is too severe. There is a lot of work and it needs to be quiet! This is the danger to which he is exposed in modern motion films. You want interesting but not overrated. This is way overpriced. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is good and includes a couple of "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, he still feels "B". The best part of it is the Scheider dialog: The only "A" part of this movie is "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mentality but has some notable scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring landmines. It was so memorable. There was not enough other scenes to make this guard for a long time.
