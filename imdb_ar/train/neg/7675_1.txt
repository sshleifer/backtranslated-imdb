Can you say that there are some movies that do not contain replacement features at all? Answer: Yes, this is one of them. After leading the dreadful director House of the Dead, Uwe Boll, he now has a less talented look on another adaptation of video games. Do not these guys get it? To anyone who can not understand, there are big capitals for you: video games do not make good films! Representation here is, at best, substandard. Group design and bad special effects. Unlike the video game (which had scary moments), the film has no imminent demise, no sense of danger or threat. The speed of plotting and planning is confused, and the paper on which the script is printed has been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of the monkey using a paintbrush. Swings, intersections and pans are rounded up in the whole gloomy case at unexpected moments leaving the audience confused and bored. Why this man had ever left near a group film in the first place should stand as one of the greatest mysteries of modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
