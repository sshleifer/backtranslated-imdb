I was intrigued by this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the makers of this film show the human side of Jeffrey Dummer. are you kidding me? The man gave a new meaning to the term "good lickin" finger, and with all the flash and re-orientation, I had a problem following the story All in all Jeremy Rainer's performance was not too bad You can arrest him in SWAT, where he plays the role of a former cop In any case, I would rate this 1/10.I just got number 1 because of Renner's performance.There are a lot of TV documentary books and movies that do a much better job in covering Dahmer's crimes.
