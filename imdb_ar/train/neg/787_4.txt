As an inspiring director myself, this film was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with a low-end digital camera probably with a 35 mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good effect, sound effects are not too much. I would have given her 7 for an independent film, but the story is not interesting. It is on the dramatic side, and personal developments are more than just a bout of terror. <br /> <br /> Not only are those who wish to get horrified terrified distraught, or sit with popcorn to enjoy only. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this film will be good if we are still in the 1950s <br /> <br /> This film revolves around a family with a dry field, which is exactly.
