I really wish I did not write this review. I am a Christian, so I eagerly waited to see this film. It looked wonderful - a Christian film with some very famous stars and a plot that looked interesting (not that I buy the same Bible symbol - you can make it say anything you want, but I believe everything inside the Bible). So I'm sitting at the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie starts and can destroy my mood in just a few minutes. I had to bite my lips to stop commenting on terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I had torn pieces of people who were shouting to the somewhat clumsy scenes, but basically dancing in clear scenes and unpredictable tension scenes, I'm sure). Once the final credits began to roll, however, I could think. There were many parts of the film that I liked - some of the most unexpected transitions, some of the effects that were really special (I do not count the visions, those results were bad), and some interesting works of art - fade, sets, type of thing. Unfortunately, I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could get better text. The music was far from the cheese (even for Bond lovers who liked cheese kinda music in motion scenes and intrigues). So I wish I could be like anyone else in the theater - like people who came out of tears and breathlessness because of how incredible it was - but I am not someone who can be appeased by a writer who casts some words on the Bible shell and Christian stamp pages on it. I need a good plot and a reasonable dialogue before I enjoy most of the movies, and that's not the case. I'm sorry, but I do not recommend this movie to anyone. This is the tragedy. When will we see some clever Christian imagination? There must be somewhere ...
