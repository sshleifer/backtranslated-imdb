This is a terrible film. Yes girls are beautiful but not very good. The plot of having cowboys getting involved with an Indian virgin would be interesting if sex did not get in the way. Well, well, it may be fun, but it is not, because it is very fast and only partly acting. I can not help but imagine how the close friends of the huge dances appear on a large screen, and perhaps they are more laughable then appear on TV. (I will not even mention the naked knife struggle between two women tied together and putting everything on his chest.) Never heard of it in the Old West. This film requires a liberal use of rapid progress. <br /> <br /> I love schlock movies but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not go to this kind of movies and they tend not to be very good, since the plot takes a back seat to the breasts. The nudes were original nudes as originally called nudity or movies where there was no touch but as the adult industry began to grow, filmmakers tried either to be smart or to try to use something else to put the seats in the seats. Those were very few smart ones that were left only by superheroes who had limited talent. Comedies were often better off as humor approached the level of first grade, childish but harmless fun. Rarely is it said about any other cross-section dressed in nudity. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has two beautiful pieces, but it has been accomplished by being a Western movie or sex. <br /> <br /> You do not need to see this again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that no one is likely, the rapist and killer in the film played Bobby Buswell, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for killing a school teacher shortly after the conclusion of the filming. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this kind of thing will destroy the lives of some people.
