I watched films like 8 or 9 Herzog movies, none of which had an impact on me. <br /> <br /> I have seen many documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man, he has a great knowledge of films and his passion for making them, but does that make him a good director. of course not! Full anti-talent. Can he make a good documentary because of the features already mentioned, but a movie with actors? Start! <br /> <br /> He can not draw or write. His scenarios are filled with poorly studied attitudes, and many of the situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and bad that they can not be hidden behind the word "art" in any way. Not possible. Not to mention the unskilled trend, like amateurs. To say that he wants to draw such a thing and to write crap like this lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene when Shitz is captured and Storsk is hiding in the back of the store. Who is the child? <br /> <br /> He is a fraud; he knows what intellectuals and false critics want. He knows the elements he needs to put in the script to attract their attention and empty praise. Do not bother with the rest of the script and the slow trend. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can produce a film like Medem, he has re-verified his old films and tried to find talent in them.
