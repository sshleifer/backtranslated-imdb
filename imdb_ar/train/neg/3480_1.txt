This terrible film is terrible. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine that Gigli was worse. The reviews made us say "no", but after searching for something amid the debris there, we decided to go ahead and give it a chance. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Aflick is not a representative. It's a picture and it can look good with explosions, but not even the kind Bruce Willis got in Die Hard. If he stripped of his shirt and ran to fight the bad guys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - it's always good. Gandolfini flops again (if not for the Sopranos, it will be washed) as he did in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck pigs each scene and as others have said - no character has any motivation at all for their actions. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
