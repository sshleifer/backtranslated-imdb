The book is wonderful, this film is not. There is no reason why this film can not adopt a futuristic technological vision for the book. Hell, the summons was issued a few years later, and it did well, so that the orange orange of the 1970s did a good job of trying to make a future world. There is no reason for this approach when the film appeared in 1984. The gloomy German expressionist colors, the black and white shots of the vision screens, the main character are in the writing job of the collar, yet he is dressed like oil. Grease in the garage. This film decides to take a fake communist approach to design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist theme worshiping the humble workers themselves. This book needs to be seriously adapted in a modern context because this book is more important today than ever before. I could not see more than 20 minutes of this nonsense. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, and it seems that this film has been created to deny a sense of realism or credibility when this is exactly what is required to deliver novel messages to the viewer.
