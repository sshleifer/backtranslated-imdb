The movies have given me sleep before, but no film has ever done it twice, so it took three sessions to finish. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke willingly and the men were caricaturists. And two Japanese women who are supposed to be Chinese and have Chinese names and speak Chinese dialects clearly. I'm still trying to figure out why men ended up sexually with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a difficult choice: will I give this movie a single rating? Or two? <br /> <br /> The movies made me sleep before, but no film did it twice, so it took three sessions to finish. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke willingly and the men were caricaturists.
