I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because the friend really wanted to see him so I went with him. As I entered, I was indifferent to the film, but I came out of the theater, and I was sorry to waste two hours of my life sitting in this lukewarm production. "Stories" are almost forgotten except for the fact that most of them were awful. What is Gina Rowlands and Ben Butchera in Paris? Certainly, the endless show of American actors gave this French film a distinctly non-French feel. The cliches around Paris were endless. Yes, most of them were playing with clichés around Paris, but spending a lot of time making fun of French clichés, they promoted them directly and unfortunately again. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We got it. <br /> <br /> The worst slides were: the part directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the silent acting (the worst?); the single hair products. One with Juliette Pinochet (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in central Paris?); Vampire (when I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood). The person who was with Natalie Portman, who actually looked like a declaration from Mentos and was stupid (the blind young man must know that Portman was playing a role when I called him). On and on he went. I felt endless. <br /> <br /> I also did not like Coen Bros. He really plays with those Parisian cliches but I did not find her funny. Just annoying. Gus Van Sant was an interesting one but it was very small (and the punchline was so obvious) that it was barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" sections and they were only about the nanny of the immigrants who left her baby in a kindergarten only to a kindergarten for a rich woman. A nice paradox there. And the part about the African who stabbed. It is the best part of the entire film but this part has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have happened in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last part, which was carrying a middle-aged woman, was very interesting but the basic tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate her limited understanding of French, but this part seemed like a concession. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt coerced and not inspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. All in all, with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting things, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a terrifying cinematic experience.
