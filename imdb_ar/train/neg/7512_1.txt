I had to get out of the theater. After an hour, all I saw was people who betrayed their wives, resembled dogs in a rut, and used the word f like diabetes with Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> It was especially frustrating because the film could have done a lot. Any person could be very fun if they were given more non-adulterous work and talked about and right to each other. <br /> <br /> The few times it seemed like there was going to be some kind of personal development, all that happened was another sex scene. The evolution of the plot in the first hour can be summed up as 1) several murders occur, 2) Finney sees the scene of the murder 3) Finney stares moodily over the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Finney cheats on the wife, Sympathetic view) is expelled from his parents' home. More than that, I did not wait until I see. <br /> <br /> The photographs and the interaction between the characters were wonderful, but there was nothing to do. Not worth the deluge of sex and vulgarity waiting for another hour until something happens. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in the community and interpersonal relationships.
