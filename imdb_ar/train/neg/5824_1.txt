I thought it would be at least aesthetically pleasing. It was slow, toned, and boring. I was about to sleep. There are some decent songs, but there is this only song in the end and it's just someone shouting "Yaowwww!" While taps randomly on a wooden body. However, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth watching a hte movie. Continue playing itunes (have the album), preview it, and choose good photos. <br /> <br /> Half the movie is someone making tea. Well, this is a simple exaggeration. But you'll see what I mean if you see it. That being said: do not see it!
