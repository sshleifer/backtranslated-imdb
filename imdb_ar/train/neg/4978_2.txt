I have lost this film using the fiery arc of RPG (rocket bomb). It was like someone cut and paste a scene from the Robocop. I'd half expect Beowulf to say, "I love it!" <br /> <br /> I watched this because I loved Chris Bruno from the "The Dead Zone" television program and did his part. He chose an odd tone, but at least he kept the whole film intact - unlike any of his followers. They continued to slip into all kinds of words from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments about how different this film is from the source material. However, even this film is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget does not justify. Having a low budget means you need at least a good story, dialogue and decent representation. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on the uncertain CGI and some fashion and clothing. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
