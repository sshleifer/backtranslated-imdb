I do not know where to start. You must turn off Tara Reid before placing it in another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have got his character motivated by Val Kilmer in Top Gun. Slip the siloals through this Drake. Direction, editing and sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gun battle?), Fashion (bulletproof vests with muscles), hey, no conspicuous plot too. I am amazed that no one has stopped the project and said, "Young people, this has no meaning, let's start again." We hope that Slater's career will recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I ever saw was destroyed.
