This film was a waste of about an hour and a half of my time. I generally like cheap horror movies, but this film was disappointing. The main drawback is not to explain the creatures. When they entered the house and found that the man who was able to hire explained it to them. He does not say anything about them except that they killed his parents, and if I miss nothing, he does not say how he managed to escape too ... not to mention the fact that he gives no idea or reason for the survival of the survivor only and nourishes the creatures essentially after her near death experience. It seems she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "cross-accident".
