The art of the cover (which shows a man carrying a scary pellet pistol) makes it look like a martial arts film. (Barely.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the title of the real movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a condom brand in the United States). This film is full of sexual intercourse. If you like these things, this movie is not that bad really. However, keep in mind these points: <br /> <br /> There are many close to the quarters and actors' limbs, (even one scene shows each actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) The film is also overcast with colors such as lime, peach and red. From the cinematographer's point of view, this movie is the queen of clouds! Many scenes feature characters very close to each other, sometimes touching while talking. Also, the hero's cousin loves women, and every other man in the film tries to kill him. Is there a message here that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Will I go to the scenes of fighting? (Yes, the special parts of someone are captured in one fight.) Martial arts scenes are short and unimaginable. There are no great things here, just your standard moves you see in the old Chuck Norris click. There is also a chase scene for cars that may be the first low-speed chase being displayed on the film.
