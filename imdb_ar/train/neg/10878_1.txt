This film is a big part of the "demons" masterpieces, and this is the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. Representation is terrible, motion scenes are accelerated, the text is almost painful and does not exist in the budget. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you do not see a real horror film, skip this and get a copy of the demons of the movie.
