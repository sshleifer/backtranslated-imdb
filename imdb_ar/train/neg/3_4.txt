If I had not read "Union Street" by Pat Parker before watching this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. It is actually a kind of film, it is well made, and I do not want to say otherwise in any way, but as a adaptive, it fails from every angle. <br /> <br /> The horrific novel about the reality of living in a working-class area in northern England has broken my heart and refused to leave it for weeks after I finished. I was shocked, shocked, angry, compassionate and miserable when I read about Al Ittihad Street women. Excellent. A novel I sometimes felt I could not read, but I was a novel I could not put out. Yes, but completely gripping. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh my God. Hollywood took the reality and fact of Parker, and was bathed in a layer of sweetened sugar over it. Beautiful film, inspirational soundtrack, excellent shows, a story of hope and romance ... Yes. Edit "Union Street" ... no. <br /> <br /> Union Street women and their stories are in Fonda's character, and their stories are covered, but many are ignored. I agree that some of Parker's stories are very sensitive and shocking issues for the group show, and that the film, which has about 7 prominent heroes, is not only practical, but content is not my main problem. The true essence of the novel - the darkness, the rain, and the broken windows covered in cardboard - is lost, and the smell of poverty is replaced by the sunshine, beautiful houses and the glittering William. <br /> <br /> If you have enjoyed the film for its positive and hopeful "reality", I would recommend that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like "Schindler's List" ... but without a happy ending.
