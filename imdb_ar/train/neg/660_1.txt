Good grief I can not even begin to describe how bad this film is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much to start with. Let's face it, the amount of PG-13 oblique is already intended to lose the nation ... slanted, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But the level of incompetence and clich√© shown in all other aspects of this film was what really blew me up. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. Here's a set of books ... no changes - and thus breaking the basic rule of basic screen writing - personal development. If you think that by the end of this film, the poor little girl will turn around and eat finally and think again. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we recognize perhaps the least interesting killer (and certainly the least terrifying killer) at all for this kind of grace. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has the most terrifying villains of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all odds of stress or gratuities are removed by an incompetent (and it looks like he is thirteen years old)) exit, what can be left to fill two hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Closets, that's what. <br /> <br /> Lots and lots of rooms: large rooms, small rooms, mirrored rooms, rooms to Narnia, lots of damned cabinets, will not want to wear her clothes for another year. In fact, this movie should have been named "CLOSET", and it had a picture of a big scary cover on the DVD cover. At the back, she could have a picture of the audience as he falls asleep and moves Roger and Ebert - something to the point: "What f * @! We wasted our time watching!"
