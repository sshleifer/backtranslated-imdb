"Show me your boobies!" Not funny, and certainly not on a channel that displays animated graphics if you understand where you come from. I do not want my daughters 6 and 7 years to think about it or hear it. I find it sad that Nick underestimated this nonsense and that's so much what we get, stupid little kids acting like stupid adults. I know you're supposed to be humorous but you have to think of innocent young girls in the first and first grade who can not wait to see it. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw him. My daughters will not watch them. I like to close Nick but I do not have a heart at this point, but if Nick continues to put down this kind of nonsense, I'll have to.
