"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) brings together a group of high school to reunite in the cabin where his twin brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, there is a creepy creature in the form of a man (reminds me of a lot of Gilman from the creation of the Black Lake) waiting in the wilderness to choose the right time to pick them apart. Cat (Chase Masterson), an Elaine Ripley motorcyclist, is an unlucky woman with an underground military hideout, while also working as a safe place for things that provoke bloody agitation. Kat knows more than she tells him (she has also suffered from losing a child), but there is a new development that most of the group has no idea. This creature may be more humane than it perceives ... and its previous identity may shed some light on the deception that has been hidden by one other person since the death of Wes. Cat Keyfa has many secrets that open as the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the film stays away from the creature that stands in the air while also seeing a misty screen when you look through it's eyes. The film contains a Dawson melodrama that often hinders any real tension that needs to build a small monster film. The direction is very gentle leading to a rather boring experience rather than raising concerns. The cast is rather less life and does not care. Pretty Maggie Grace may be the only draw for this film.
