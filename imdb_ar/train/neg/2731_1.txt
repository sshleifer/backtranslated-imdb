Very bad and the easiest episode I've ever seen .... at all. <br /> <br /> They tried to compensate her by giving her, "We know we're doing it." It would be funny if not for the Simpsons who did it already. It will not be compensated if they reach the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> The memories of the past have occurred as part of the fantasies of the usual personality (essentially JD). The memories of the past were not even of the actual events that occurred, but just groups of say, J.D fell or did not know .... Elliott falls. If I wanted to watch the Scrubs group I was going to on YouTube and did not waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs finally fell into the trap that most sit-com must do, which is frustrating to me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I hoped you would not be such a sit-in. <br /> <br /> As I thought passing, why was Dr.Cox bald?
