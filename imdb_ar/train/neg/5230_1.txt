Although Robert Knox is a fan of his fans, I'm not one of them. His movies are asinine and amateur, which is not very funny, unless you are a 14 year old enjoying a backward sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not as famous, as its immature fans would like to believe them, by harassing people in Wikipedia, or stuffing voice ratings here at IMDb. It is certainly not recognized by any of the mainstream media, which speaks volumes about the "fame" of its creator. <br /> <br /> Benfer enjoys some simple skill in limited animation, but he needs to stay away from his youth and learn how to write some funny material before being taken seriously as a real artist. However, it is so far just a child has a camera, this shows.
