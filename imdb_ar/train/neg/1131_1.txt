It is a shame that even the talented director, the dispelition, could not get the decent performance of a grimly talented actress, Phoenix, Esther lacked the substance to convey a concise and very clear plot. In an attempt to achieve the focused circle of the actor's plight, performance and presentation are very disconcerting and poorly performed to draw sympathy from the viewer. At a very long runtime, repetition in Esther's melodramia conflict is ineffective and reduces the storyline to a weak framework for catastrophic viewing. The content is unconscionable and unwarranted, as Phoenix is ​​struggling to implement Displination instructions, just as Esther is trying to do so. We never felt a convincing victory over Esther's pain, and we never felt a triumph in Phoenix's talent.
