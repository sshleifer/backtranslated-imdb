This seems quite true, any movie starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know whether this story is full of holes or that Dolph is a very bad actor. There is no spoiler here, and it seems to be delayed for push, push, constipation and touch in this film. In my opinion, it is surprising that some of these ventures find venture capital to reach the can and the theater.
