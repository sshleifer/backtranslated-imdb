I live in Salt Lake City and am not a Mormon, so why did you rent this movie? Well because I live in Utah and I think it would be good to see the sites I know in a movie. I really knew I did not get the inner jokes, so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer in the headlights. What I was surprised at was the anti-Mormon antics that have been put into this film. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon film, presented to members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the stereotypical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. Everyone from non-Mormon, was not much, drank, smoked and had an amazing selfish attitude, why? <br /> <br /> That's what really put me in this film, they made the Mormons very clean, but the rest of Utah think they're full of evil minds just because they do not follow the LDS texts. <br /> <br /> I can understand the existence of conspiracies around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not close to the truth. As I said, non-Mormon was filmed in the film as drunken orgasms, please! <br /> <br /> I think I do not understand that because I do not belong to their faith and I think I never would.
