I never expect the film to adapt to the novel (especially the beloved, like the evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, a screenwriter and executive producer in the film, I thought the evening was good. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the book, do not care about this movie. It is so far from the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to each other. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are quite different: the bride in love with Harris. Harris is the son of a housekeeper. Friends are drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think there's one character to make it from the book to the screen; Oh, it gets worse with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> In fact, we did not learn from the bridges of Madison County to get out of the story that we are supposed to enjoy, to the scenes of our heroes' adult children who are facing hateful and young battles, simply not working on the film? This film is a disaster. skip it.
