This movie was very disappointing. From the fuss that made me decide to see Phantom Love (I was expecting it?) I was expecting something lively and taught with beautiful pictures. She had some interesting photos but these pictures were often random and meaningless. In fact they seem to have been included to fill the time. In the end, the effect was unscrupulous. <br /> <br /> I think the film was meant to be in the air, but it was not. The lack of a coherent conspiracy did not help things. You might say it was vague, but I think it was inconsistent with no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed troubled, but the plot did not attract me enough to care about her position. Without looking at the list of actors, I did not know that you see the main character as a child. The film contains a very simple context of time, place or character. I was not proud, but the sex scenes (there were several) seemed to me useless and confused me more, I knew Lulu but I was not sure whether the man himself or a different man or a lover or her husband or was a prostitute. Only when I saw the credits that I discovered that the back hair was meant belonged to her lover. This film has succeeded in making what should have been awful (the sequence of dreams involving Lulu's mother) seems a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The rendering of the nail was indeed more logical, and it gave some indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not miss the actors because I do not have much work to do. <br /> <br /> I do not know whether the lack of context or flow in the film was due to uncertainty or because it was tannana but the end result was dim. <br /> <br /> I can not bother talking about it anymore.
