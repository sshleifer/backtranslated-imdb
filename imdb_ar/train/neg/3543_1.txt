Has been latent for a few years or so. I've never been moved here before, so maybe this movie deserves a star, but I doubt it. I've just watched it on a DVD, having missed it in movies because of the disease and have not been able to watch it yet. I have not read about it intensively, and certainly have not thought about the film a few months ago. It was just what the friend had picked up at the store, so it was watched. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The shot you talked about in the top summary was higher in a trailer and on the label. Directly from the outside, Jason Statham has hair. As in any other GR film. Or any JS movie I saw. At least not in the quantities presented here. Ray Leota's underwear should be pre-warned. It's scary and funny but not ha way. What's more in the TheOffice-but-mut-minor-and-somewhat-humorous way. They all say the same thing: "This movie does not look like anything you'd expect it to be." <br /> <br /> Now, based on the experience of watching previous movies and dense, I was expecting this film to be a few things. Such as: <br /> <br /> () Cohesive, <br /> <br /> () Fun or charming, <br /> <br /> () is not a complete and absolute awful of staring navel, () is something more fundamental than a variety of ill-fated superstitions of what is just a standard Eastern mystical ideology that has been worn as "a wonderful, modern and self-conscious art form" > <br /> () Hope to be better than "idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed Balhaji, it has completely failed to identify any square above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) was badly modified {a pace throughout the store, high-level jump cuts in the 1970s for amateurs, "incomprehensible" schemes! Delivered through portable mounted images, I could have continued ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) shot as if by a 14-year-old gothic depressed spent the weekend in Watch Truffaut and Godard with drawn curtains <br /> <br /> (x) So, look back through the idea "I'm really smart, me", I feel determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that Mute people (ie: everyone they do not like) in the audience, make sure they get this point, <br /> <br /> (x) is a real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> As for the ability of some people to "get" something, it's okay. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that caught my attention: children under the age of 25 may have been better understood by liberation. Maybe, but the adjustment is supposed to make your work easier, not less. As for "Genius is recognized only by the enlightened brigade," soak onions and grow. There is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say that the reason why someone else does not know great art is that they do not understand "the letter / material / the moon cycle / the higher rationalist threads of thought" by the author / poet / artist / palm reader / Idiot Savior "to explain his" vision / grand scheme / his unity with Gaea / a large bucket of dog patients ". <br /> <br /> For me and for so many more and more people, trash her. <br /> <br /> Films, art, stories, poetry, and anything designed to be watched by someone else are supposed to be attractive and moving. In some ways, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or what you occupy yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way I could have pushed this forward in time was when my watch was almost out of my inevitable zaw. "The biggest trick he ever made was to believe that any part of the film meant anything at all." Now, please, by all means, toast the buns for me.
