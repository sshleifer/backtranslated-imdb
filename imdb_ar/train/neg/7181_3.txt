Now do not get me wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love her a wonderful life and I really enjoy Carroll Christmas with George J. Scott and Alistair Sim. But this film is shocking.

I do not know what's wrong with this film, but there seems to be someone trying to sing through the bodies of the dead. The only thing that saved this movie for us was turning off the sound and watching the dancing numbers accompanied by the south park CD
