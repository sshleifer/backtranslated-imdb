In many of the films I've seen Warren Oates, I've come to a firm conclusion, here's one talented person. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in the 1960s television series Stony Burke. Since then, I have followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. It happened in 1974, when Sam Beckenba gave him the best film in the film "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia." Of course, his biggest claim of fame was his wonderful role in The Wild Bunch. I always thought he was capable of bringing any particular magic figure, that is, until I saw him in this flop. The film is called "Chandler," a tribute to those seeking Iron Fist in the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because, said the summary about the nose was particularly hard eye, you are immediately interested. However, I sat patiently throughout the entire film and found that this story was dull, impressive, slow, twisted and confusing and that if it had a theme or plot it should be left in some dark back rooms. Together with some of Hollywood's best supporters, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pincent, Charles McGraw, Richard Low and Scottman Brothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach Fife, but it stumbled on the launch pad. As a result, one of my favorite actors found a poor-looking car that never went off the ground. **
