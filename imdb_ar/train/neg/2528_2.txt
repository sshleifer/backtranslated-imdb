The Van is a good film about a man trying to seduce girls in his new truck, in order to seduce them. The only thing that does not fail this film is filming a heresy in the United States in the late 1970s. It seems to have been entirely made by amateurs. It's trash, but I loved it! I must admit that I am a fan of garbage 70s! Hope this one up to 100 IMDB! <br /> <br /> 2
