... It was so that, in a good conscience, I could tell everyone how terrible this film is. I barely managed to do that in twenty minutes before thinking of myself, "Wow, that's very bad." To be frank, I would have given this movie a single star if it was not for Isai Morales (although he had little screen time). It's the role of the only good acting film, which is a shame because I really love Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. <br /> <br /> While watching this I started thinking about going back to his role in the Shoshank Redemption and realized that it was not as good as I thought it was. The problem: His behavior in prison / the strong man seems like an act. His conversation seemed to have had a very bad impression. Have you ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to? I doubt it, but maybe he should have. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, they have been able to inject the philosophy of the prison a little and make it seem unconvincing, especially when you think that the speech originated from the Rasta, which was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> I did not usually criticize a film like this, but when I saw the film it had a somewhat favorable review. I felt like I had been cheated and lying, and I think I should try to save someone from the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
