Who loves awesome comedy shows like the Little Mosque in the Prairie? The only two types of people I can think of are: one, liberal Muslims and liberals who proclaim themselves from every ethnic group feeling happy, and there is a show about Muslims that does not matter even if the show is good or funny at all (which is not). Two, older people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, and old jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC needs to take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they continue to write comedy only for the elderly, you have to guess what will happen, their audience will soon die and there will be no audience left. Will I be so curious who writes in this show? Do you think they are really Muslims, or funny young people? No, I bet that old white men write the same jokes for the same kind of bad BBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you look at the Canadian comedy shows there, Air Farce was finally, just got out of the air (thank God!) but we still have a lame duck like This Hour has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer, we pay for it , Not to mention this bad excuse for the little mosque "comedy" on the small lawn. Are you supposed to be offensive and funny? CBC will only think that this lame is at all humiliating or funny. Shame on CBC to squander our tax dollars on software just a few people will bother watching.
