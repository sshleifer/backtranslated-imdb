Blazing flames! It is a battle between two strange brothers (Denis Quid and Arles Howard), both of whom can set fires mentally; they overcome childhood differences, while Debra Wenger has caught a keen interest in love in the middle. The filmmaker Glenn Gordon Caron (a TV child behind "Moonlighting") plays the dark-colored comedy in Vince Gilligan's scenario with a very simple presentation. The film is like an entry from a very enthusiastic film student for a $ 15 million grant. It is characterized by the prickly energy of a great business, but in a shapeless manner that brings out nothing of the characters except the eccentric eccentric. These are not even characters, they are plot functions. Hardly been released to the theaters, the film is a disaster, although it is strictly as an example of style more than content, but it looks good. The wing is the only solo in the team that seems really puzzling. * 1/2 of ****
