What is interesting is that acting. Not bad, not just enough. It was rather lame. Special effects or lines were the only reason for this failure. They were not terribly bad on their own, but their situation was a tragic one. The show seemed slow and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed up the film, but it completely failed. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this disaster has been blamed for special effects. I can not believe it, they were a bit cold. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Although they were probably all they had to choose from with a little fan recognition. An experienced actress had brought something to the part, such as Appleby had never done. Scfi shows some really good original films, it's very bad that this has failed badly.
