Well, no, not really. It's not a really good film, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel like my rented money was exploding, and sometimes all I could order was. The plot is fine, nothing wonderful or new, the representation is very bad, but the cast is beautiful. The guidance is acceptable, but the effects are terrible, especially the wolf's effects, which in the film The Werewolf, is a very big problem. There was a fair amount of nudity, which is good for me, but it was not hot. All in all, it's fairly average direct to the video movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're bored of genre lovers, check it out sometime. I was watching him again. <br /> <br /> An additional fact for the terrified, Ken Hooder (Jason Furhees in a few of them) plays the Werewolf.
