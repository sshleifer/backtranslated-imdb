Jason makes my best effort to bring fun in a ridiculous position, but the film failed to make a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because Julia Steeles's character looks as embarrassing as being exciting and exciting to be close to her father's wife. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's because she and Blair's Selma characters had to be thrown in the opposite direction. (Salma Blair seems to be more complicit than Julia will be). <br /> <br /> In both cases, this film is another Hollywood experience about a possible real world situation (you do not get dressed in your bachelor party and do not descend) your cousin, who fails to live up to the promise. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter to make sure that the actors (even if they are wrong) are doing their best with sub-grade material that does not go beyond its offensive theme. So, instead of getting a successful jogging festival (ie, Animal House or American Bay), we left the middle of a part of the humor and stupidity in part (Ala meat 2 or something).
