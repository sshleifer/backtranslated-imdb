One of the things that surprised me about this film (not in a good way) is that Nathan Stoltsvos, who seems to be proud of being the main historian on the subject of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working in this film, taking into account how many actual events were changed or ignored . <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers said von Trotta said she had never meant to sleep Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give every impression that this was what happened? Why are there no other possible reasons for the man's release, such as the Stalingrad catastrophe, or the fear of the Nazis that the Berlin-based international press will discover more about the protest. <br /> <br /> Also, why did the whole story play a second violin to cut the story of the weak family bonding that was repeated? Definitely a wonderful thing like this can carry your own history! In some places, it seemed as if the film had two short lines that seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> In general, this film failed to achieve its goal of drawing attention to an unknown action. Resistance, a shame, because it is okay, it could have a great impact.
