This seems to fool people into seeing qualities in this film that do not exist. <br /> <br /> Near Dark covered the same area but with more class and movement. <br /> <br /> Why kept the script on their "big secret" for a long time was a complete mystery to me - I guessed it in the breakfast scene at the beginning of the film. By the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a "big" case, telling me something I did not know. "<br /> <br /> I found this film to be useless and might have challenged such conventions, unfortunately those agreements are that the horror movies are tense and filled with a real sense of horror.
