This show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of valuable hard drive DVR space. I did not expect much and I actually received less. Not only do I expect to cancel this show in the second episode, I can not believe that Geico will ever try to use the cave cavern again. I'd better spend a night checking my daughter's hair for head lice instead of watching this piece of trash. I wonder what ABC has taken to make this offer suitable for the Fall 2007 calendar, and possibly a realistic hospital / crime / documentary program featuring the AFLAC duck? If I fail to express my opinion on this offer, let me be clear and say that it is not very good.
