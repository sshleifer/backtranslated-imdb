This film was awful. The end was terrible. There was no plot of the film at all. The only thing that was appropriate in the film was the act performed by Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. Their performance was excellent! The only problem is that the film did not perform any acting any justice. If the script is close to capturing a decent story halfway, it would be worth watching. Instead, the performance of Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones is completely lost on a shocking divine story ... or its absence. All I had to do was wait for the film to happen, something to make the film .... a real film ... and not just a complete dialogue between the characters for what ended without reason. No more than a common dialogue was going to happen in that time period. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only notable thing is how Robert Duval portrayed an elderly man, a drunk, drunk, an old man. Nothing worth happening throughout the entire film including the end. When the movie ended, I sat astounded ... amazed that I sat through the whole movie waiting for something interesting to make the movie watch worth watching. never happened! The group of characters suddenly began to roll, making it clear that the film was already over and I realized that I had lost only two hours of my life watching a movie without any plot or meaning. It was not even a story. The whole film happens in a day. This is. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners in a farm. How much of a story can happen in a single day (unlike the day of training in the film)? The performances of the entire actors were excellent, but they were so wasted on such frustration for the film ... if you could even name it a movie.
