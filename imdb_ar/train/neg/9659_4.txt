After watching this movie, I was genuinely disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the output - I was disappointed with the ads of this film. <br /> <br /> The trailers indicated that the battalion had "chosen the third director" other than surrender or death (the Polish information was so misleading that they had a choice between killing with artillery or German guns, but they translated the wrong title "battalion in non Replaced "). I was tickling this place right and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I began to disappoint when I realized that the third way was just sitting and holding bodies, then sitting and counting bodies ... Then I started to think, "Hey, this story can not be that simple ... I bet that this smart officer Will find a cunning way to save the rest of his forces. " Well, he did not, they were sitting and waiting for something to happen. So I was. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real World War I events, so the book could not take much advantage of their imagination, but I even thought that I found this film really challenging and even a bit boring. As I wrote in the first place - it's not wrong with actors, writers or directors - their marketing performance has raised my expectations high above the level that this film can deal with.
