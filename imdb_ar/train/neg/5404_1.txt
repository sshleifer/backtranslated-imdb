Have you ever got this itch to kill an hour or two just to do housework and watch a very bad movie and challenge the reason? Well, by renting movies on a weekday, I see an art box for this show and I see T-Rex. I know very well that the dinosaur on the packaging was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, and I know I had to rent this just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at least. <br /> <br /> Crazy scientists, clandestine formulas, are more interested in their wealth and shareholders than their lives, and of course, a large-size T-Rex company, with bad cartoons and sock dolls. Was it through the film that there were scenes clearly split from other films? Not to mention the hunger at Rex never satisfied ... never. How he was suffering from hunger is out of me because he really does not suffer from the throat (really if you look at his mouth when he is wasting, be solid ... like a game or something). Now, I love watching B-Movies incredibly bad from time to time because it reminds me of the quality of famous movies. This was hilarious. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are unmistakable scenes, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> Did I blame the movie budget ... Yes, but acting did not help either. Well, Tony Todd has been really well, as for some female roles ... When you cry you should not go out "tears"? Hey, I will not be angry with this film, I know what I was getting, and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then watch Jurassic Park immediately and then lose the world back. Mr. Spielberg will write thank you letters the next day.
