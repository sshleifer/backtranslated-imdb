Just a horror film about a beautiful family in the suburbs dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement who continue to feed people who pick them up from the street. Of course, there is more to that, but to say more will be useful. <br /> <br /> For me, this did not come together because he was trying to get it in two ways like family drama and horror film. The film tries hard to walk in the lead between these two types but seems to stumble everywhere because it tries to be shocking, something that never happened. Does not help to have the final revelation less fearful then "Oh", as in "Oh, this?". Maybe if I had not seen a lot of horror movies recently, it might be better or maybe I did not seem to compare it much. <br /> <br /> Human
