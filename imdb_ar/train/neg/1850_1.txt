Director Ron Atkins is faithfully insane. This very low-budget film lists a few days in the life of one of Harry Rousseau (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), he works in walnut and receives a rubberneck doll from a bitch friend. He began taking orders from the puppet to take huge amounts of drugs, rape and murder, not always in this order. What starts to take advantage of balls to the wall, remains as good, but it repeats very quickly. I lean more crazy towards crazy. Difficult to forget once though. Kinda like if Tom Green made a horror movie ever. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell becomes completely naked; Yasmine Putnam shows the breasts and robe <br /> <br /> ANTI Candy:
