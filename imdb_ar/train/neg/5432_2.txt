A battleship sinks ... Survivors of them, hanging on the nearby life raft, are sitting there doing nothing while we go to all of their minds for a series of memories of the long past. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Coward is the only one I've noticed during credits, everything is cinematic because of Lean. Technically, it's very good. David Lin just KNEW movies from getting to go. There are many moments in which the Coward school dialogue takes a second seat and leads the senses of Lean Visual Center. Try the soldiers who were coming down from the ship near the end, and this entire scene; a snapshot of the track towards the singing song, the scene in which we live in a bombed house. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. It is completely wooden, does not display emotion, personality or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what the other performer says, that he is just waiting for them to finish them so that he can get out of his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <br /> <br /> The occasional, somewhat repetitive story and the previous memories of the story are overwhelmed: there is no central story you make, just give an overview of the characters. However, it is an interesting film worth watching - and for the first time good for Lean. It's not a deep or penetrating film, it's certainly a propaganda film, but it's also a show of Flynn's editing skills - all about how to assemble pieces.
