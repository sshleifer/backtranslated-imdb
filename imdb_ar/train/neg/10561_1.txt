I saw this film in its own time period, when you gave birth to a child out of wedlock not only ruin your life, but seal your child as a cat. These days of "single mothers" that may seem elusive, but it was very true. I'm not mad at laughing at someone who stumbles, too. Between these two problems I found it difficult to find this funny film. At that time I did not know who he was taking or what a wonderful reputation he enjoyed. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she got nervous because she was very active. I loved "raising a child", but I found this movie awkward. I'm sure the punches in some church jobs probably went up, but I needed to drink after watching this again. The idea that a girl should be drunk for "marriage" and pregnancy just add to misery. An entire city can run you under these circumstances, so the result of this film is a really enjoyable part. Of course, he shot me, I do not like "it's a wonderful life" too.
