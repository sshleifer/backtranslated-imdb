I'm not a fan of horror movies, and I've only seen a handful of them (not one of "Halloween" or "Friday 13") - but I appreciate horror film not because of bullshit. I'm sure this is not scary. <br /> <br /> What is the extreme fear about a small plastic skull appearing everywhere? In all its manifestations, there are distant shots, so there is no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in itself is that scary anyway, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the cousin of Klaus von Polo (John Hudson), who marries Donna Reid (Peggey Webber, One of the worst performances ever) that begins to see the skulls and hear mysterious cries of a group of peacocks on her husband's palace. Did you mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning accident? Oooh !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and / or push his wife crazy. If you want to see a good copy of these things, try "Reversal of Fortune". BTW, Jeremy Irons is 100 times more gifted than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MSTing was fine but nothing special; coupled with a short "Gumby", however, it makes for good viewing. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Now, Mr. von Polo has rephrased himself: "How bad is this film?" "You have no idea!"
