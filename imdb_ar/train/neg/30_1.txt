I did not like the idea of ​​the turtle at all since 1987 We knew that TMNT four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each of the four brothers named after the great artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Ravell and Donatello so Venus here has no meaning or plays any important role I think the TMNT series Old was much better than the new ones that contain Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like Story of TMNT We knew in 1987 that our new enemies in each part is a good point to do some actions but getting a female turtle is a point Too weak we have some actions, would like to see more series TMNT is new but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without female turtles.
