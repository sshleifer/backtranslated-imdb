This has been a kind of exotic film about a low-life life in New York City centered around a main character (title name, played by Brad Pitt) who is believed to be a musician of the type Ricky Nelson, except that he has no real talent. <br /> <br /> It's good to see a bright woman in New York City and an awful tone of voice take over. That movie ruined for me. She must be Katherine Kinner, who usually plays the role of tough woman and nozzle. <br /> <br /> Hairdressing on a house - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing this role better. Final Note: It is strange to hear a 1992 film (unlike Woody Allen) in a mono voice.
