From horrific death scenes to guns shooting without making sounds for a character called Punk. It's all cumbersome, slow motion, a bunch of fantastical. It was good to see the man with the head and crouching cocks. He was visually creepy and probably took the role of director at that time, but even in 1936 one would have thought that there would have been more imagination and even portability to film like this. I kept waiting for something important to happen as people stood around giving speeches and acting as if they were demonstrating in a walk in the office. Then there are those bullets as the previous commentator said. Probably the best guide is to find a water spot on someone's pants pocket.
