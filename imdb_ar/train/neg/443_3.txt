Overall a very disappointing picture. Very slow too based on the basic story. The role of Maria Schrader in the search for her family past past. (It seems that every shot takes forever ??) There is really no rhythm in the film. *** *** Booty *** Her mother Ruth is saved from the Nazis, by a German woman, played by Katia Riemann. The full character of Ruth is one dimensional, so very typical. *** Avengers finished *** The film cuts back and forth between this day in New York and Berlin and Berlin something 40s. Please when doing so, give the audience an indication of the exact time the story takes place. Is there a clear time indicator? Very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** Spirits *** The full width and hole of the Jews are terribly tortured, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. This is how the Jews came out of Rosenstrasse? The question of the Jews was not answered. Was it Goebbels who released them? Does Lin Lin Fisher with Goebbels? In Venice, the film won the acting award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Should be the Jewish theme ??
