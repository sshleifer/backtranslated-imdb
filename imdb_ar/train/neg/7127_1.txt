This movie was bad to say the least !!! The large number of wonderful cars that have been shown in this lame movie is being watched. The race starts from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to be completed in an hour and a half ... in the Ferrari F430. I did it in 1HR 50 minutes in a Honda Accord 4 horse small car 140HP 1993. Seriously ... This film does not do justice to these cars. It's clear that these writers are just driving the car under the maximum speed of their hands @ 10 and 2. I remember seeing in the news how Eddie Griffin crashed on a Ferrari Enzo worth $ 1.5 million, ranging from 30 to 40 mph >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... Andy Ching director sells bigger! It brings shame to his race. I'm just wondering how many people have expressed their happiness verbally just to break into Hollywood. He participated in a film that depicts Asian Americans in a negative and counterfeit way. Asian Women >> Cheap money squeak whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive gamblers and thugs who beat them all the time. What the heck is all the fear of Asians? Why do they always need to be portrayed in such a negative connotation? I am very sick of the way in which Hollywood always depicts Asians in such a negative and false pretext.
