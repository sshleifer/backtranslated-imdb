I'm a big fan of Nicholas Cage and I never thought he would work in a movie like this. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it should not be bad to see them at least once ... but trust me, it is. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the old movie. But why they want to reproduce a film like this. The very basic idea for a good horror film is that it either has to contain very clever text or it must be very graphic. This film does not fall under any of these films and is still stupid. I continued watching the film in the hope that it would become interesting at some point, but it did not happen. <br /> <br /> So, this movie is not great for both Horror and Cage lovers. Maybe you can appear on TV.
