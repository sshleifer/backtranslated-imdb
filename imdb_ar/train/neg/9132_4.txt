Dr. Fendish's plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, starred by Peter Sellers, is a mockery of the characters that Sommer Romer created falsely until the end of Sellers' journey. The plot was very simplified, and if done, it was possible to handle the right way well, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reasons why this film was not good was poor dialogue, cheap laughter, intermittent guidance, and the awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> Acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest in this mixed picture. I found Sellers depict Manchu demonic with brilliance, with the occasional lines that we will remember. For example, there is a scene where Fu Manchu is confused by the followers who say "Ah, they all look the same shape to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed loudly at this line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a strong supporting figure caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as Rear Officer, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (his last film too, not a way to end his career), and Mr. Caesar (who performs Eccentric cousin of the Capone family who works for the FBI). These characters kept me watching her too. <br /> <br /> The groups were also wonderful. The oriental designs and English society in 1933 were elegantly portrayed in this exotic picture. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my advice to you is to watch the movie if you are Peter Sellers or the Master of Caesar Fan. Otherwise, you are better off settling aluminum foil.
