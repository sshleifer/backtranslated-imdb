After stopping at the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled upon it. It seemed attractive from the summary, at least, so we tried it. Here's the kick: the first 20 exciting minutes! It's really fun! Oh, wait, speak very quickly. <br /> <br /> Somewhere out there, the film turned disgustingly into a basic right-wing Christian brainwashing. I'm not quite sure what's going on, but I think the screenwriter found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script and did not have time to adjust it because he had a KKK meeting to get him with his friends from Westborough Church and his hood was "clean" . <br /> <br /> Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious folly. Much like video games have classification systems, the movies need a kind of code: maybe a small intersection in the bottom corner to show us that a movie will turn out to be the worst. <br /> <br /> Unless you participate, do not waste your feelings on any story that's crazy about this story, and you will open your Bible in your lap as you watch it and plan on how to transform your neighbors, and do not waste your time. It is some of the worst junk that has emerged in a very long time, and there is no longer a need to fund extremist religious nuts.
