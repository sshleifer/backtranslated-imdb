Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Liuni tea? Ryan O'Neill? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. I dropped everything to watch this movie on cable. At the 30th minute I was having trouble staying awake. 60 minutes in and hit the registration button and fell asleep. I finished watching it the next morning. Should not be bothered. What a wonderful waste and an idea that could have been an interesting story about "A Day in Life ..." Treat insomnia if you suffer from it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of continuous sleep. A terrible dialogue. The continuity does not exist. It was possible that the camera was working using a Super 8 hand and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a complete disaster.
