Oh God, I saw this when I was only 11 or 12, (do not ask how) I may be young, but I was not stupid. Anyone can see that this is a bad, bad, gross, non-public and very silly film. I saw more impressive effects at Disneyland, saw better performances in a school play, and saw a more convincing swim in the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring children who click on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story is in northern Australia. A few aspiring young people try a new water sport and surf in shark-filled waters. Soon it becomes clear that there is something more dangerous in the water. After they learn what, they get help from a grizzled middle-aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal for revenge from eating his family. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every crocodile made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Placid Lake, and worse, a sequel. Blood Surf should be the second worst crocodile, I think, with Primeval and Crocodile both closely following. <br /> <br /> Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures there, resulting in more than 100 infections or deaths each year. But films such as Blood Surf not only destroy the brutal image of such a creature, but also destroy a good and half hour of viewer life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
