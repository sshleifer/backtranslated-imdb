I have only watched this movie and must say that although there was initially some effort to produce a good film, this was quite terrible - but not in the sense that I am sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child were directing this insult to intelligence believing that all potential viewers are mad or very difficult to entertain or both .... Praise be to God for rapid progress! I can not imagine what kind of scenes the producer was thinking about when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, though barely, and screaming text for complete rewriting, .... I can not say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decides to produce horror movies, it will be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie interesting, I strongly suggest that you look for some guidance regarding the purpose of the movies. There is a much better fare there. Join a club, read the comments, but above all, avoid such nonsense.
