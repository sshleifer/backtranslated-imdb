I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was very long above all. Second, the things I saw in the film were beyond the text, even in what I thought was a comedy like the rest of the previous films. Things are not funny in the film: Khatib hits his girlfriend, beating. The film was very long - talked about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it would end when waking up and still playing! Some of the things in the reunion were too much - like singing the lady - I felt like I was watching almost a spiritual song here! Come on Perry, you can do better then this!
