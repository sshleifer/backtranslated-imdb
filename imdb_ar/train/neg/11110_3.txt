I just want to be known, I do not make films often less than 5. I was very excited to watch this movie. The many trailer bumps on television made me months to make me really want to watch this movie. So, the other night when I saw it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story story seemed interesting enough - some dude slaying unsuspecting people on the subway. There is a photographer obsessed with missing persons. Where are they going? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a relationship between some of the photos he took, becoming obsessed with the dung, followed by Yada Yada. The film had a way to absorb you, although the plot was very predictable. "No, it's dark, look behind you," I say, very bored of the cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot, though predictable, was interesting ... until the end. Jack_skellington_freke says on the message boards "That was good until the end .... then it became ridiculous." I totally agree. And here the spoilers come ... <br /> <br /> Look, I was hoping it would be a crazy killer, a psychotic man obsessed with cannibals. No, the secret society has kept the creatures alive for centuries. Wu. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but this one sank.
