All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this movie (although it only allows you to be 18 years old). They heard it was a very scary movie and they felt cold when watching it. I feel very sad because children can not see what a good movie is and what a bad film is. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another film. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it is impossible to find a decent en for such a stupid story. This movie is designed just to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some music, you know exactly when you will be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended and turned to my friend and told him (a little loud) that this was a waste of money, some of the stupid children seemed strange to me. These days, I could have made an Oscar with a home video about goldfish, if I was using just the right marketing.
