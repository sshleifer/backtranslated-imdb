The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers in the role of the cat in the hat is frankly not funny and Mike Myers can not be worse. This is his worst film ever. The acting and the story was awesome. I mean how to turn the most beloved stories of Dr. Suss into a movie and being one of the worst films of all time and such frustration. I could not see a worse film, maybe a baby geniuses. But this film is very bad and I can not even describe how poorly they produced this film. Bo Welch or writer should be released. <br /> <br /> Hedeen Predictions: 0/10 No Stars F
