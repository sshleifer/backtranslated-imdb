I realize that it is not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow offers if they are interesting but I find myself quite uninterested in bored of the series. <br /> <br /> It seems that the BSG version is: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> Caprica appears to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> < /> Maybe it will grow interesting but as of episode 3 I can barely see it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my watch list for this week. This is the sad situation. Channel Syfi really destroyed the Friday night lineup. Whatever happens to glory days SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday nights? They had something good there.
