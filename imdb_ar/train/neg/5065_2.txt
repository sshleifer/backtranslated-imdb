This movie is very bad. A weak story, weak guidance and less representation. What really angered me was the blatantly blatant announcement of a well-known Internet provider. Obviously some scenes are written to do so, advertising. This movie is a slap in the face of anyone paying money for this. <br /> <br /> Do not see this, it's not worth your time.
