Over the years I have seen a selection of these movies directly into the Seagal video, and each one has the same amount of entertainment. Unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Sure, the sequence of events was amusing, but that was pretty much. Segal was in the prime when he did films such as Under Siege and Under Siege 2 and Executive Resolution (at least on the job). But over the past 10 years, these types of films that Segal's star does not really meet have already qualified. <br /> <br /> On the more positive side, the film has benefited well from time, such as some practical sequences and the use of wit. Only when the film seemed to continue, did a wonderful movement scene get it out of the bottom. I honestly believe that more Segal films would be better if it was not the only one that the fans in the film recognized. Supporting actors and actresses is very important, and if his current films contain well-known actors and actors, the film may have more popular results.
