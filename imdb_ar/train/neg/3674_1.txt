Note: I'll reveal a key part of the chart, but if you look at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you'll know it already. <br /> <br /> This film appears to have been written by an 11-year-old boy who is not very bright and may be very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the United Nations and the National Safety Agency seem to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when the main intelligence agents chase this after someone who kills him only touches within a minute, do not wear protective clothing (not even gloves). These are quirks in the context of this film. In the scientific world within this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 gravity goes sideways. <br /> <br /> The truth is that people in this film do not behave (with a few exceptions) in the way humans behave. Every time someone responds to something inappropriate. The story of love (of course there is one story) makes the texts of the soap opera look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
