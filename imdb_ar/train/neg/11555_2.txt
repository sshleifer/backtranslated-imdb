Fantastic Italic film - it was very bad for producers and not part of the script. Summary of the basic plot - the man with a red fetish goes to invite these women to his apartment only to go to some kind of coma and continue to face them with varying degrees of success. Only the backward crew behind the scenes must have thought that the film was an ad as it did and cut the film. Nothing flows, lost on any red he has at the time (right?), And it seems that most of the time the camera man had finished and resumed photography when he woke up. I can not blame him I passed 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume an attempt to restore the existing small plot. Warning When you see the end do not try to connect it to anything that happens before - you will get aneurysms only. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money. The only reason to get the number 2 instead of the 1 - the small chance of piracy between the film version and the terrible version you saw.
