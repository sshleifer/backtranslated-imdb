I will not say that this is a bad film. Unfortunately for me, I feel that the more I know about the fencing, the worse it is because of the fact that it has become completely unrealistic. I have been walls since I was 14 years old, and this film depicts it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (he seems to have a duel background), but most other actors - especially students - seem to be lost.
