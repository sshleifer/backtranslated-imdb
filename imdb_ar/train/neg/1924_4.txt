Doctor. SEUSS 'How do you want to watch a holiday movie that inspires your seasonal spirit and continues in the story of Dr. Grinch Stole, CHRISTMAS (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> Seuss classic classic, do not see Dr. Suss how Christmas Grinch stole. "If you're old enough to read this review, then you're probably bigger than to get any kind of fun from this animated picture. Colors, creative production design, imaginative construction, fashion group, cheerful load noise, and characters make up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village of Whoville.This is unfortunately where the positive elements of the film end; the rest of the production is just an excuse for Jim Carrey to deal with the screen with Satanic smile, all on the go A very broad scenario without doing much. <br /> <br /> Many people know the story of how Greenwich stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time writing a detailed summary to read it. In three major works; the development of the Grinch and the preparation, the Whoville Festival, and the vision of Dr. Suss from the one means theft of who is from Christmas.There are many familiar names within the credits here, but there are no familiar faces.As in "Battlefield Earth" I see why producers employ expensive representatives just to protect their identities from unrecognizable makeup and fashion. Regardless, there is Molly Shannon of SNL in the role of Betty Lu, wife of Bill Irwin, later played Lu Lu, Cindy Lo small father, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambour is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins praises his wrong voice for the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the only lost lover of Greenwich. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers try to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary sub-charts, focusing too much on Cindy Lo. Scenario Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman feel like going everywhere across the film scene; there is little focus by director Ron Howard, as the script is predictable, highly condensed, and crowded. The only character that is given any distinction here is Grinch himself, all other characters are dolls of the scheme, shapeless, and do not care. The dialogue is too passionate and too tacky to be pathetic. Example Greens: Oh, Who-manity! <br /> <br /> The movie's recovery factors go to talented production designer Michael Cornbluth, fashion designer Rita Ryak, and the make-up department. "How Christmas Grins Steal" is a very good-looking production. The groups and atmosphere created by the directors are detailed and detailed; it is like the audience visiting the world as in a dream. The people of Whoville are covered with makeup so much that we can not tell the actor to read the comic lines. Although dazzling, I can not really credit the performance, because they finished because the expensive art section replaces them. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrie is one actor I can talk about. His performance is what destroys almost the same film. He's very cocky like Grinch, so exaggerated and so funny that the story can not be identified anywhere as a seuss work. Surprisingly, although there are some ridiculous moments due to some polite, polite sequences, the laughs come from Doraemon Jim Carrey. It is almost like a film specially written for Carrie to transcend his role. This film leads to a wild comedy, but without a mind, it is just a pale shade of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this film, historians must check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Suss has turned over in his grave. <br /> <br />
