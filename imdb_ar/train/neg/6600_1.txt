Yowza! If anyone loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! This film, while a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through the appearance, sound and routine, falls far short of honoring them, or even being a film of any material. I blame Larry Harmon. The conversation was torn from old L + H films and implanted in an unrealistic way. The plot is filled with useless descriptions of other non-essential stars. The Pinchot dialect was strange to Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with a tone, It was Mr. Hardy. Where was the music number (the good)? Discordant editing, harsh representation, shocking lines, and physics are impossible (although they were probably trying to give it that sense of cheap kits?), And overall, it's terrible things to see. It is more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film and photography in the 1950s. Do yourself a favor and watch as many of the original Laurel and Hardy movies as you can and learn how things were. You know what MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not always respond with almost half-closed jokes. <br /> <br /> I pity anyone who thinks this was a decent upgrade / honor for the boys. Where was the classic theme song?!? Why ruin 'here another good mess? Why skip "any wisdom"? Why was there a senseless frenzy of participating stars ?! Why miss the Wizard of Oz ???? Why should Larry Harmon be in it? Why Bozo? Did the learning channel help finance the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
