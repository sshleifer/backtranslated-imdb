... then they will have the right place to make this nonsense. Sorry, not "mystery" as claimed, it is a mumbo-jumbo religious. I kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that he promised me, but the "evil" in that click would not be envisioned by a five-year-old child with learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that they have actually been able to find some actors with a bigger name who are willing to participate in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, I've changed my mind forever, and I'll probably avoid anything they do in the future. I am also a bit upset that I now have the name of the writer and the name of the director that I must keep because I will avoid anything they do like plague from now on. <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that everyone will spread religious fanatics here and say that this film is 10 out of 10, etc., and will post their comments first. This may lead to more people being deceived, as I was, to believe that this film was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's out of the video shop to recover my money for false ads. Too bad, they can not bring me back to the 105 minutes I spent watching this thought which was actually a horror / supernatural Hollywood movie.
