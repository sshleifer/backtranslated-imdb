Oh my, where to start ... This movie was just awful. The writing was bad, the acting was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this film is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie but I certainly did not understand it! I thought it would be decent enough because I'm not picky. I have seen many horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all horror movies, no matter how terrified. At one point in the film, you comment about the "syrup of the blood atom" and in the special features they already admit that it is a Caro syrup (corn syrup brand ...) The film contains all the necessary things for horror film (Blood, Nudity, Crazy Killer, ) But she absolutely lacked anything to make it really good. The writer must take some chapters or give up!
