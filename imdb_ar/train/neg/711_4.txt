I'm not sure it's a spoiler. Maybe it is a public service. If you are one of those people who focus on instant gratification and who skip the final appropriations, you will miss the final line to express the voice of the news anchor, which states that the United States just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 to end World War II. Here are some problems with this closure: <br /> <br /> 1) The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three other non-human films in their minds to fill the gap between the film's events and this astounding conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person will really repeat that they have "not seen" one of these human-edited spaces created in their heads for free, instead. About bombing time and money to see this humanitarian aid from a video store (or on a cable). <br /> <br /> 3) This final end of the sequence of newscasts may represent the first information that some young viewers have had about World War II, leading them to conclude that George W. Bush is the last heir to the Nazi throne.
