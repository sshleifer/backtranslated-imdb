This film is recorded by the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school, watching the Rwandan genocide around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief illustration of the history of the past and competes with Rawanda. She then moves on to the story as recounted through the eyes of an ideal young woman "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who does not take life or attitude seriously. When he and the driver approach a roadblock he plays with his drivers not realizing that this is a dangerous moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as a true tribe of soldiers they will be killed. This is how the story is treated by the chaos that unfolds and unfolds around it. I suddenly realized that every Rwandan (including his driver) was involved and that European soldiers and tourists could not and would not help. Media cameras can not stop using the sickle, and there are a lot of militiamen who shoot them. The headline comes from the captain of the armies, saying he will fire at the dogs who eat the bodies around his compound, but he will not shoot the militiamen who kill people around the compound. Mainly because they did not shoot the soldiers yet. Finally, desperate to know the situation and the man who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat to one of the targeted victims, and run away with his tail between his legs, instead of facing permanent death with schoolchildren, he promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It is more than a study of the characters, and comes to Jesus' moment of one personality, more than the genocide story in "RAWANDA". This film did not have to happen in Rwanda, but in any of the holes in hell there could have been the genocide of this world at any given time.
