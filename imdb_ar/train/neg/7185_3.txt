I was attracted to seeing this film because of this plot and my desire to watch horror. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed, it turned into comedy rather than horror. The acting, the dialogue and the flow of the film were so bad. Many of them did not make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people, all terrified of one person, even though they are in a secret place and all of them are healthy young people, and the person who threatens them appears to be in trouble. I kept thinking, maybe it was a parody of another film like Scary Movie, but they were trying hard to make it look awful - focusing on trying. <br /> <br /> Blood and blubber were also very bad. I saw Halloween costumes look more believable than this. A man with his head cleaned ... looked clean - he had signs of bone, flesh, blood and even head. A powerful blow must be pushed down with an ax on a corpse to something ... it looked like a man was swinging instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Detecting the person who was supposed to be the main villain is a twist, but contradicts other parts of the story. What was going on in the man's mind to turn like this? If there is evolution, you should at least add to it mystery and suspense.
