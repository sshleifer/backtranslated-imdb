The only thing scary in this film is that anyone who makes it may make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, The Tooth Fairy was just terrible. It looked like a bad-behaved children's film became confused, with the charming melting of "Wizard of Oz" and happy kids with some bad influences and insults. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast is completely unnecessary except for being comfortable there to kill in some way. Sister of the two brothers, Shiraz the Ora Reader and Ms. Macdonald have no meaning in the film - they could have included them in the main plot of some interesting side-stories but obviously they can not be disturbed. People who watch the film know that the characters are in a bloody death scene, but come on, at least TRY and they have a little conspiracy. The story is generally weak with the wrong behavior of the characters that make you wish that all be eaten by the witch. <br /> <br /> Add a weak and weak plot that works together (children are particularly wooden) the movie ends with a complete failure. If only the MST3K could have gone in this one ...
