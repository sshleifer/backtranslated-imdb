In fact, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Life bug also do it? I think it was in a Disneyworld in that tree, so I say before you go and use that logo there. Also, Shrek 3D was a motion simulator in Universal Studios. They still have to consider it a movie, because it appeared in the "theater" and you can buy it on a DVD. The film was at least pleasant. I love intelligence. I agree with Animaster, they've done a wonderful job of directing a movie from just an external adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
