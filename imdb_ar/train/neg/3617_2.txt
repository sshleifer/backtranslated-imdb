Really, really bad movie slasher. Psychotic person escapes asylum. Three years later the professor of sociology is killed, at the end of the scene. After a class yesterday yesterday (hey, that's what the title card said) is a new sociology professor at school. She makes friends with another sociology professor working there, and starts dating another professor. All the students feel bored, as well as we. <br /> <br /> There are a number of address cards that indicate the amount of time elapsed. The scenes are very short and are limited to different characters elsewhere, resulting in little progress of any kind. Many scenes include characters walking, talking, sitting, talking, and serving little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the passage of time is not clear when we see a body for the second time, ask ourselves: How long has this body remained there? Also, at least one person seems to have missed it. <br /> <br /> The killer is able to kill someone by stabbing him in the chest, and another stabbing him in the crotch. And another cutting off her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The lid of the video box contains the fan: There is no movie in the movie. The back cover contains a photograph of someone wearing a graduation hat and threatening a group of women in the bedroom. The central redhead in the picture is in the film, but no one wears such a uniform, and there is no such scene. Killer is one on one accurately.
