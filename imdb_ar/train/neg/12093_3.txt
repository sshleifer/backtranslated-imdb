Isabel Hubert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer long sections of Huppert's face, and I am happy to see him. Huppert is not a moving actress - she records feelings with a smaller lift of eyebrows or a smile. <br /> <br /> Unlike enjoying an experienced actor who excels in her career, there is nothing in this film that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-mutilation and Sadu Masushi and strange behavior, "La Pianiste" may work for you, unlike these, I could not find any recovery value). > Buried in all these strange substances there is a nucleus of truth. People who compete at the highest level - music, sports and whatever - start out as strangers, and turn into strangers through a competitive environment. <br /> <br /> A trip to the cinema is not worth learning this life lesson. <br /> <br />
