My friend gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in hospital and a team of doctors were trying to surgically remove the DVD cover from his position. <br /> <br /> You've stopped the excitement of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels brought me a lot of entertainment, and the previous script modifications were wonderful, but I was young, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, people who had been sleeping should have been asleep while doing so. I imagine that castings went to something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I enjoy fish a lot." "Excuse me completely, you have been assigned, get some money." <br /> <br /> There is a scenario. I have read Chapon, who I hope will become blind before he can see this piece of Dong, and has nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why I was upset as I did, but it may be related to the fact that listening to a weak speech of a 90-year-old drunken duck hunter who has a dysfunction in the right lobe may be a cure compared to the fact that the only massacre committed by a massacre Children of second class. <br /> <br /> This is a real line from the film. "If you tell me something you've never told anyone before, this moment will be unique!" Unique? Is it? really? Of course you do not have a painting. Please pass me Imodium. I'll have a whole bar. <br /> <br /> Guidance ... good. I have nothing. Maybe Rason Marshall Thurber got the word his grandmother exploded or anything else. Adhering to the direction of comedy. Do not stick to guide commercials. <br /> <br /> This movie is very terrible, making me hit my head with a very difficult wall that brought me back to the Stone Age. I give it two stars because I do not want to be the man who saw a single star movie.
