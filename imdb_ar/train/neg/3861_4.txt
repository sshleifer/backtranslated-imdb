I'm not rom / coms lovers at best times. Some were very good (check out Dream for a Insomniac), but this one is more of the same but less so. <br /> <br /> With a 100-minute run time, I expect more than one laugh every 30 minutes. The only real laugh is when strangers and male friends help my personal instinct. <br /> <br /> All I can say is avoid. I am a gaurentee there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf worth you $ 3 <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (just because I admire my big)
