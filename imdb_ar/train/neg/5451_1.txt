Filmfour will perform much better than this small part of the film if they get the right kind of reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is located in Glasgow (although two secondary characters have nothing approaching the Scottish accent). The hypothesis, about people living anywhere, who all gather in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning because they work in night jobs, has made a really funny, insightful, twisted cultural film. Instead, we have a group of very sadistic sado and a plot was made to decide I was amazed that it was not blocked. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well. Oh you know that. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time. A painful dialogue - it seemed like something written by a group of 16-year-olds to a GCSE drama project. The female character was absolutely unnecessary - she had just written as a symbolic female in the hope that she would be pulled out of the women to see her. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind that bites heavily and laughs at beer ads and can usually find a wandering tour in packs screaming on Saturday nights in nondescript city centers then you will love this movie and find it "the right laff". Anyone else, running, does not depart from this unfortunate little difference. <br /> <br /> One question, when the group left the "boring" coastal city (Saltcoats by the way although it changed the film's name), to return to Glasgow, why did they do so via the Forton Expressway service at LANCASTER in England?
