Man portrays the mountains of Alberta Rocky in a great way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan make fun shows as it always seems. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a mountain that tells the people of Dawson and Yukon to elect a crowd (yes crowd!) and law enforcement themselves, then armed fighters fight in the streets to control the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing remotely resembled an event on the Canadian side of the border during the Gold Rush in Clondike. Mr. Mann and his company seem to have made a mistake in Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian north of the Wild West. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers are ready for the kind of Reefer Madness from the howling fun with this ridiculous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.
