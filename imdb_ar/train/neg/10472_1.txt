I should have known that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as a leading figure. Words can not describe, nor do they appreciate the magnificence of this film. But let me try to describe it: terrible representation, terrible dialogue, thorny positions, and through which you feel that you are nourishing the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It is a weak attempt to try to show Hollywood that the film can be amusing and has a deep religious message associated with it. They failed miserably. It was obviously the worst film I had seen in a long time.
