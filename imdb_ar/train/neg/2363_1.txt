This movie was terrible. The first film was not great. I mean, it's ridiculous. If they do not have enough of the first five films I had to add another film, why not make it in a continuous series like James Bond? Bond movies are very good too and that these films just stink, I do not understand, you were supposed to have this intersection between types such as horror and comedy for good. My niece will not be afraid of this silly attempt of horror, spitting in the face of people who want at least fear at some point in a horror film called. Please do not over these movies.
