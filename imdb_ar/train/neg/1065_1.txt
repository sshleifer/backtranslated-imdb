On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really apologized to them - we all waited for us and spent the whole time looking at our hours waiting for the film to end. Half of the quizzes are odd, with very little entertainment value. There were some Paris scenes - for example, I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not figure out anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. If you like exotic films, buzz, counterfeit, do not miss this opportunity. If you are on earth like me, you'll be sorry because you saw it.
