This was an appropriate boost for me from the local video store. Do not commit the same mistake you made. This film is boring, unconvincing behavior, and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is not written well and sound; stumbled in every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper appears in a few scattered manifestations, himself disjointed; his role was clearly not an extension. Although the film is supposed to be set in Puerto Rico, it is very similar to many Hollywood films. All the main characters are Caucasian and many of them tend to speak English in false Irish dialects. Individual. Anyway, when you see this on the local video store shelf, keep walking.
