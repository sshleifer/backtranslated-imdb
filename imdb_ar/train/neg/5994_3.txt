Well ... this movie could have been very good! All generations of Thunderbirds have come to love it, and this movie has some features that one can look for in a good Thunderbird movie. The craft itself and Tracy Island were actually moved to the big screen, while preserving the designs that we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply wonderful, where Mrs. P and Bill Paxton, although not exactly who I thought Jeff Tracey was, was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and asked us to believe the old children 8 years can fly 200 tons of machinery. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film was about the kids who made me feel like Jonathon Farkis was slapping me with wet fish and laughing at my hard-won money in the film. The fact that Alan Tracy was very repulsive in the film seemed to be able to convey Machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some damn simple machines to use if this is the case. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film did not know whether it wanted to be serious or humorous. I tried to pay tribute to the irony as it fell on her face in general. 3/10 (2 for machines, one for lady P)
