Greetings back from darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? I brought out two of my favorites of all time in Avalon and Dinner. He also had some great films ("Rainman"), but he always gave some attention ... so far. I think the worst thing you can say about comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is a boring definition. She has never been a fan of a pure slap stick ("shut up and fainted"). There may be 2 chuckles at all - if you can pay attention for a long time. The best part of the movie is the Gap Run song title by Redbone for both audio. If the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been acceptable. Rachel Wise is a great actress and realized they all wanted to do comedy (even Julian Moore), but the real world reveals weaknesses. Amy Boehler, a member of the SNL team, is the usual role that plays in the role that turned into a princess trailer trash. The film's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work that travels together shows some promises, but then the chemistry disappears because of the weak text. This text looks like most of Jack Black's personal ideas - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
