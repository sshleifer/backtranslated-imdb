This movie does not offer anyone anything. Does not work at any level. Representation is terrible, boring long drool. It is clear that along the end of the sexual scene they were trying to be appalling but ended up being a parody of what the film was about. Garbage is complete, I can not believe what this movie was funny. <br /> <br /> I am very sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie because although this would be tantamount to breaking her away from the movie, the NC-17 movie is awesome. The problem is that no adult will stick to this film because the film is presented as an interesting episode of OC or something aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
