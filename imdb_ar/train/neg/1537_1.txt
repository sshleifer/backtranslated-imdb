The really bad shot on the "movie" video was not made by anyone, not two, but three amateur video makers. <br /> <br /> If you make a horror movie at least, throw some blood, nudity. There is some blood provided by latex cut arm props bought at a Halloween shop. There are lesbians and wokers but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects, fade, erase etc. Once a while it seems a little black separates the viewer. <br /> <br /> The terrible music by the bad heavy metal teams that occupy their websites on most of the final credits. Wolves are represented by rubber masks that are connected only to the "actors" face. They did not even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that I am 10 years old using a video camera to make a better film. There is absolutely no reason to buy, you can rent or watch this movie except as an example of how a low budget video does not work.
