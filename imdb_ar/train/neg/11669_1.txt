I suppose it is good and trendy to see great things in the absolute emptiness of such a film. With the futile excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene free of blasts, foul language and barbed wire. Its simplicity has its place, and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of these cases. <br /> <br /> Capture long scenes without dialogue and a dreary, diffuse scene. I am sure they must carry some meaning and great insight, because the implicit message in my prison is perplexed. The representation is poor ... thin and pedestrian ... and has one of the worst scenes of crying in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). The scene is lousy, and the long, ironic sequence of the girl walking in the barren garden is as enjoyable as pulling teeth. I would like to call this contradiction, but because the film has not built on any kind of peak at all ... nor even in the "erotic" scenes ... it would be incorrect. I'm sure there was a script that was used during filming, but with the size of the dialogue, I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film does not offer anything interesting or amazing ... There is no great story, no spectacular visions, no visual drama or excitement. Apart from entertaining moments or three, this film is a waste of two hours. A boring and tragic film.
