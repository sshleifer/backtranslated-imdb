How can no journalist or critic compare us to the other Flemish film Kongo Express (1986)? There are also some characters in the congo Express game that have been assembled without having anything to do with each other: Jean (de Congolese), the worker, taxi drivers, street singer, Roger, Jay, Lucien and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman star was not Luke Goebbels as well. This should not be a reason to exempt them from defects in the script (if there is text) in any case blowing the wind. The joke (the only one!) At the concert around the ice in the fridge is taken from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte puts a lot of salt on the potato. Some incidents occur in the film but no explanation yet. Tom Barman presents us with a film that is more like watching on television than a theater film. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
