O wasteful! This film could have been really fit, but writing, in particular, nonsense, and the main characters shallow and uninterested. Mike Myers was good, and historical recreation in the late 1970s was well prepared, but overall, it was a waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, which deals with similar features and the same basic time frame, is the best BOOGIE NIGHTS.
