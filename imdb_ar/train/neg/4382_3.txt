The fifth, "Black Emmanuel" I saw, is likely to be the most intriguing plot line he is dealing with the daring journalist who investigates the racket of white slavery / prostitution that he travels from San Francisco to Rome to Macao, Muscat, New York! The film is jammed with ex-veterans in this series, which can not be interpreted, playing quite different roles, namely Ivan Rasmoff (shown here as the head of the UN Third World Committee!); Karen Schubert (as a feminist contender) and Don Powell ). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (although it was shown in the dead of night), it was heavily edited and a special graphic scene (described in "Stracultr") where an Asian slave trader gets his cool by However, there is an appalling sequence in the late film when some politicians fool some girls (including, Gemser and Schubert at the Midnight Junction under a bridge in New York with a group of sounds) The way they get their votes, get them!) - with his colleagues in his highly regarded society - looks pretty sound. <br /> The most ridiculous element This entry - apart from the gemstones tend to erode completely every time you enter a house (even in front of ideal strangers) - is her trip to India to meet a sorcerer / guru (George Eastman was much like Christ!) Who found a way to prolong sexual intercourse Of course, when Emmanuel calls on him, it ends up with the speed of libel ... !!
