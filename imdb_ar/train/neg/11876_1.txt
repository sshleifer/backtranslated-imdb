I think that's almost all I want to say. I feel compelled to explain my actions though. I have never seen such a production of an arm wrestler, I mean by all means. Although the physical work of the camera and the operation of the booming MIC and other technical aspects of the film is laughable, it unfortunately is not the only area. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of the classic independent movies that have been saved with their large descriptive text and plot, unfortunately, this script contains a terrible scenario and a terrible representation and worse, horrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime for every independent film to be distributed like Haiku Tunnel, and there are 101 other independent films that died silent death. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony, but that could be my only explanation of how this amateur family's production is distributed at all. I was very upset about why they chose this. <br /> <br /> The only part of this film that carries any intrigue is its title. However, the reason is so let down. I hope this review will save a small number of people who might be interested in this movie title from watching it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I'm very tolerant when I'm in the cinema, but that was a lot. I will never forget the "tunnel", because it represents an important point in my experience in cinema. It's a shame it's a low point. <br /> <br />
