I like Adam Sandler, and one day I was looking for Cast & Crew on one of his DVDs and saw "Going Overboard" and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few of my companions and hired him. We put it on the road and were shocked to see that Adam Sandler, who was not yet of puberty, looks as if he was 12 years old when the film came out. I could not even see 30 minutes of this nonsense, and I did not laugh, laugh, or even smile at this film. In fact, it was the only time I was moving around when I saw the horror of this film. I could not believe how difficult it was to try to make viewers laugh at this film ... It did not work once. Despite seeing horrible horrible camera angles and hearing the disgusting scenario, I realized why I never heard this film ... because it absorbs more than anything I've ever sucked before. This film, in my opinion, was the worst film ever, .... EVER!
