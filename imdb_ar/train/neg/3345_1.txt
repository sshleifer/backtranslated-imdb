Normally, I will not be qualified to review something I have only seen for half an hour, but I will not. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself!

"So how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?" <br /> <br /> "You sure you know how to show a girl a good time ..." "A general child ran for his life instead of helping someone, he summed up his life and his personality in this line -" I'm a stuffed chicken! (This was the US network version) the old man was right! No wonder we've left ... "Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Not actually a spoiler) A bad guy yells (at the fire)" Aargh! Fire! "
