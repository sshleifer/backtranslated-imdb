Please! Do not waste any money in this movie. It's really nothing more than a boring tedious Blair Blair made by some high school kids. I could not finish watching it, and I usually love watching all kinds of movies. How on earth can they find a distributor? !!! Funny but: Check out Wikipedia for "Dark Zone". The person who wrote the input must be out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. The money that should have been spent on actors, camera and editing. So this will not help, because there is no interesting idea at all behind this film. Unfortunately, the Dark Zone has already received a lot of attention. Please, director, producer and author of this film, stop producing films like this ... You do not offer yourself a service. The world will be a better place without this film.
