There were good presentations by Robin Williams and others, but the film was generally heavy and disappointing compared to the positive remarks. <br /> <br /> I thought that CNN could become a serial killer salting people to death: sad man in hunting clothes ugly victims about the food courts, adapted from the opera and reading medical history even ask him to shoot them. <br /> <br /> I think the film appeals mostly to Romanians who believe that outsiders are interested in their images. I expect that most retail workers want a break from customers.
