Well, what I can say about this movie is that it is wonderful to see many Asian faces. What I did not like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical ethnic figures would do in their role. The Asian girl who lacks confidence and has to play someone else's role to move forward, the white man was fascinated by Asian culture and chose to leave his white world behind the yellow land and black taxi driver "keep it real." In addition to all Coke, Shanghai Tang and Dankin Donut product development was a bit obvious. The story itself was interesting, but I thought how the story would be resolved. Then again, when you watch romantic comedy movies, you can not expect much, but again I will be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the flick.
