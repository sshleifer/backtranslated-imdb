Amen to Magell. There was a lot of confusion going on. First, how do you know the movie you are buying? Henry Sealy plays a leading role in each of them. I bought this movie thinking it was a small serial ... what was discarded !! It could have been a comedy but for the little girl that was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for popcorn TV but he was not true in this film (where was his English accent?) And what about the love story ??? The film was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power - not a slave ship captain mounting up with an English virgin who is looking for her father ... <br /> <br /> If you had paid more than $ 7 for this movie, I would Call the police - because that would be a crime!
