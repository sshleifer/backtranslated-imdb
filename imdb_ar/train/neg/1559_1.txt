This may be the worst film I'll see if I live 100 years. I think a group of first grade students could have reached better plot lines as a chapter project than this. I am stupid to watch it, and God has mercy on the souls that paid for the production of this film. <br /> <br /> After I finally turned it off, I had a desire to vomit. <br /> No one had a clue about photography when doing so. No one has an idea of ​​acting. Nobody had an idea of ​​almost anything. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X displays these craps at times. The only time I saw them was in a Starz one! Channels - not even the main ones. It was around 3 am in it.
