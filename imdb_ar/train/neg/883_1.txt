The problems of this film are many, but I will try to mention the most obvious and troublesome problems. First of all, while the subject refers to a number of short articles on Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and television, was about something strange, usually sexual. The lines of the story were thin or nonexistent, and almost every scene, camera capture, line of dialogue, and emotion expressed were completely false. I finally arrived at the point after an hour of thinking about the amazing garbage that came out of them (something that was not unusual for me in recent years.) I thought the fi9lm movie was directed by some of the qualified runners of the third rate films, But I think director Mira Nair (at the same time, before Amelia, a talented) participated in this disgusting farce, so perhaps the talent in America is collectively descended into the pit.
