I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard it was the best photography ever of the novel. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> How can any true Austin fan admire this adaptation as a puzzle for my eye. The scriptwriter has decided to stick with some of the most absurd pieces of humor that are embarrassing at best, but also spoil the feeling of the period. For the actors: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a somewhat shallow heroine (but then there will be any "hot" doubtful American star in the role), Tony Collett is artificial, and poor Iwan McGregor is designed to look funny! <br /> <br /> I really can not say anything good about this movie. I seem to be among the few who do not, but if you want my advice, see instead the television production starring Kate Beckinsell - believe me, this is much better than this surface rubbish.
