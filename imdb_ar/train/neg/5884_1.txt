I'm impressed with the big movie. I love films of all kinds. This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I realized that he was following the book closely, raising the point that everything should not be turned into a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not strange, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not funny, they are annoying; especially considering that they are supposed to be real. <br /> <br /> This movie has the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie he hated, only Run With Scissors was more dysfunctional and less funny. <br /> <br /> I will never get back those hours. I wanted to wash my mind after watching.
