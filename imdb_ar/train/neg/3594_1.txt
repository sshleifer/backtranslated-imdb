This is not a horror film, but it's a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, must be avoided by any serious horror lover. No plot, terrible representation and disturbing music. If you're just watching the trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a shame that this is available on VHS or video while not many good movies. If you like vampires try Hammer Productions or the Italian Goth from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. These are masterpieces if you compare this with this garbage. Rating = even "1" too much! Believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
