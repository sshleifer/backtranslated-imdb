This movie is another movie in my list of movies that I do not care about. I saw this 40 years ago as a teenager, he was awake to do so, and was very upset to find that he was 95% romantic, 4% all else, and 1% if that was. This is what I call the taste and movie switch, with an interesting title, and the actual film is a scam. This subject deserves a good cinematic treatment, this film is almost insulting to those who served. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille were not law-abiding and were not the product of abusive houses; they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. I suspect that many of them came from a higher class background than Tab Hunter. Aviation school is not reserved for smart foreigners and know everything, the individual like the person who was photographed here will not last for two days, or he will either be a store or a pedestrian. French army discipline was often violent. In short, another copy of the Hollywood story of a historical episode deserves proper treatment.
