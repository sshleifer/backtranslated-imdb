This film really began a wonderful start. She had the ability to turn into a truly intimate romantic love story with a cinematic recording of love between "Harlan" and "Toby" in long, poetic and poetic scenes. He really did not need to be anything more, and for a moment there he became excited because someone was producing a beautiful film for his own sake, another classic and immortal, perhaps a modern legend. Why, oh why, then tinkering in the middle of the road by making the leading personal (Norton) psychic other? I might miss this point, but do we really need another film about psychosis? Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the patient side of human nature as evidence of a more general distress in the film industry? For a moment there, I would give a mental note about the director's name; now I left feeling indifferent. At least it must be added in the film's defense that all actors began to invest in their roles. Also, Ivan Rachel Wood is really nice to look at and a good actress with plenty of potential.
