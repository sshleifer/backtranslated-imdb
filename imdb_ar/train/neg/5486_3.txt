First of all, this film begins with a really stupid observation: a 10-year-old girl, playing in a moving vehicle, decides it would be funny to cover her mother's eyes with her hands, then cause a horrific accident that kills the mother .... I'm sorry, there is no positive 10 year old child. The rest of the film does not get much better. After the death of the mother by the 10-year-old youngest on the planet, the father moves the family to Genova, Italy, where he will teach at a local university, but here is the interval: he does not speak Italian! Then the little girl has "visions" of the mother (who has been killed), often terrified by the night terrors that always end up with the father who holds her and hands her down. Then we are forced to watch this family constantly being lost and then found and then hug and then cry and then lost found (followed by more of course hugging and crying) so much that I actually wish a kind of natural disaster to just wipe all those ignorant people out of the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love the Indies, but feeling uncomfortable with dumb people (I mean really stupid) is ridiculous and meaningless. It is truly shameful that this film was based on such unclear characters that flow in such backward scenarios, because the language was interesting.
