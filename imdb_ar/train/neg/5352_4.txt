The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal not to mention great fame. I loved honey, shrunk children when I was young. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The groups were very amazing and the cast seemed to be with each other. Now dear, I blew up that child was so stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little older now and the mother ends up on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite element is threatened with rubbish, he wants to curtail it and keep it, but he and his brother are blocking the way. But when the wives return after forgetting to give some money to their son, they are also caught in the machine, leaving the children alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but as I said, it was just a family movie I thought some might come out of. The original honey, I shrunk children is the best, I think everyone can agree. The third situation was not so bad, I would recommend this film at least on honey, I've blown the Kid's movie, and it was at least more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
