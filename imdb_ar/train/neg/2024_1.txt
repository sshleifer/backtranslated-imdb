In an effort to capitalize on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100, this is the excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, where 12 dazzling "dancers" sparkle in bright red brothel fashion. The rider is given the beginning of a phrase, such as "Any team lost ..." with three options, A, B, or C, each of which completes the phrase. The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these three options. The host - William Schattner, in his hateful devices - asks the rider whether he wants to "lock the answer" and when the rider says "Yes", he chooses "Dancer", yelling "Show me the money!" A scroll containing an amount opens, and if the answer is correct, it adds that amount to its earnings; if it is wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So ​​theoretically, the rider on this bleak disaster could actually end up because of Schattner's money). There is also a "killer card" and if a racer chooses a girl who has this slippery scroll, but he answered correctly, nothing happens. If he has answered an error, the game will go to "Sudden Death" and she must answer another question. If he makes a mistake, it leaves nothing. <br /> <br /> Before going to the commercials, Shatner screams "Let's Dance" and Shatner, the 12 rider and rapper are boasting booty. At the end of the show, Chattner asks the ladies about a "final dance" and they all hold it. <br /> <br /> I give this show 6 episodes at most, and at this time we hope this pathetic will be offered an excuse for the game of the door. (It could have been worse - they could have bribed Cuba Gooding Jr. in one way or another to be the host, even though I bet he was a better dancer than Shatt, as they call them these days.) 08: Guess what - I was wrong! Lasted for only 5 episodes. There is hope in the world.
