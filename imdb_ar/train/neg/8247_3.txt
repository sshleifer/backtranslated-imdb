There seems to be another British romantic comedy, enjoyed by viewers all over the world, with an overwhelming appetite. This weak effort is an unintended parody of this genre - all the classic cliche scenes are here from the ironic misunderstanding to jogging after the trains leave to declare love of the person. Characters are a one-dimensional cartoon except Love-Hewitt, who can bring some coherence to the film. Things threaten to get out of hand in the section of reasonableness as the film progresses; our well-rehearsed comment of faith finally comes to an end during the unfavorable end. If you're looking for Bridget Jones, you will not find them here at Notting Hill.
