Another shake "the son who will not grow up", and only other entries like talk. Haider in another bad wig, directing Napoleon to, what, for the third time? Anna Knight is memorable, as always; Jeff Daniels has contacted this from another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... How can one become a late typecast of this profession? Do not care. Nothing said here has not been covered several times. I will say that it is about 100 times better than the "failure to launch". There are very few funny shots in the film, unless you think that cursing Eli Wallach is funny. Ha, ha! It is old and threw the bomb f! Tee, hee, hee. Pitiful!
