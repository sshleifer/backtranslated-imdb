Chris Kattan is a great screenplay actor at Saturday Night Live ... but he is likely to leave the film industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoying energetic character who basically comes off the mildly retarded and at speed. Do you want to know only the funny parts? Things they showed in the reviews. Yes, delivery to take me funny. Nothing else is. Especially when you can say that trying hard to be a physical comedy, you should not try it for one. However, the "demolition of your veterinarian's office" comes very badly. This film made me develop the twitch of the eye. Avoid it at all costs and keep watching the SNL.
