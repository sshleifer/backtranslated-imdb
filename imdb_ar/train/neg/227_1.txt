Was it supposed to be a serious comedy or drama? This film begins with a light-hearted joke between three women. Fine. He moves to a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few alien between them. Fine. But when the plot intensified and became black in the end I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. Continues in this context for a while to finally try to return to the joke with a light heart. But now it is too late. It's hard to see why these women still talk to each other, and the end result is not convincing. Really a lesson (for British directors anyway) about how not to make films. It is hard to see how the producers convinced themselves that this film would work. The box office proved to be the real flipping, because I never heard of it until the end of this week (four years after it was released).
