This movie should have been fun. Young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. in the space. But he continued, he had unpopular characters and did not have a target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are mistakenly fired into space by a robot friend of theirs (his name, appropriately, Jinx). After that, the space scenes are long and repetitive (the same incident happens twice) either cheesy or scary according to your point of view. Adults and adults will be bored and children may be afraid because the way they are photographed leaves a strange feeling. <br /> <br /> There is a love story in its infancy, but unlike the shuttle - this does not start. Why it is primarily included is unclear, except perhaps to add extra tension between characters - but it fails if this is the idea. <br /> <br /> Lea Thompson should be small and crooked, right? I mean "back to the future" is fantastic. But no, they were annoying and medium-looking. Not someone you want so far, or as a friend or even a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky because he showed up in the movies again this performance. Maybe he can act like Mickey in Life Cereal ads, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It does not fit the screen and I do not think we can live with it at home. I would really be happier if he never went back to earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
