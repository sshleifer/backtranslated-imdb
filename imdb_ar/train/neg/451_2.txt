I do not care about the number of nominations received by these scraps for the best of this and that. I did not know whether I was shutting down the group or suing the OJJ lawyer for the wrongful damage to my mental health. Rarely do you feel bored; to call this Ruth entertainment is a slap in the face of all the filmgoers all over the planet. The whole story was stupid, the acting was uninspiring, and the drama was emotional. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this intangible experience.
