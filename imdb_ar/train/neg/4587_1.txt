Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What we know about Bleep" was almost impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin" and Fourthly, history will go down as the worst single film I have ever seen Fully. This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly impressive, because I have seen a lot of bad films. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece in modern cinema consists of two intertwined parts, alternating between a silly and crowded plot around a very disturbing plot of cameraman, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a group of heads talking about how to justify physics Quantum is their new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if your day begins to reflect on the likes of Enya and Kenny G, this movie is right for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to spend a good time, a great deal of good herbs, this film is also suitable for you. Otherwise, stay away. Take my words for that. <br /> <br /> The first thing that surprised me about what Bleep knows is that it seems to have been edited and put together by the same kinds of people who launch cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, and the glitter of the computer across the screen, And other kinds of kindness. From leaving these people anywhere near a theatrical version is a mystery to me. I think this is what Kenny Gee is doing to you. The film was full of GCI cheeses, the things that you or I could produce on our computer through a video editing program without a prescription, but you will never do it, because it's just a very silly way. <br /> <br /> The _oblearly_ script was written by someone who has no writing experience at all. Not all characters and conversations were more cumbersome and more prosperous than beliefs. The "writers" felt as if they had to move every part of the relevant information, or rather misinformation, which most of the film was about, until the end of the throat. Well, given the target audience, this may not have been so bad for an idea. The main character, for example, spends half of the featured pill film. Apparently, although it has been considered unconvincing enough, so there are at least two dialogues, referring to their own pills specifically, only if viewers can not tie the pain and excessive suffering to her small white pills Take it whenever you feel down. Acting ... Well, I've seen a better representation in Ed Wood films, no, that's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little play I was in when I was 12 years old was more inspiring than this. This has already happened. <br /> <br /> The story here and there has been interrupted with a group of modern or random heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and mystics who have advised themselves, have continued about how Quantum is supposed to make physics an "explanation" of how man Or women never create a reality of their own just by sharing the experience of life. Reality, you see, is a probability area for a range of different possibilities, and is only set in stone mode once you choose Observer to notice it. What happens when more than one observer notices that they have not said, but again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, watch, you will be God, and no one will give a curse about silly and old things like critical thinking, logic, etc. All causes are rejected immediately because people are stuck in their ways and unable to achieve "model transformation" and "descent into the rabbit hole". Moreover, the uncertainty principle in Heidelberg is supposed to be a positive evidence of alternative realities, parallel universes, and so on. <br /> <br /> When talking about rabbit holes, this measurement permeates the film. All these people continue to talk about the descent of rabbit holes. I'm not sure it's related to anything else they've been saying or showing, but the only thing I'm sure of is that it somehow involves anal sex. In fact, the film is _extremely_ against sex. Everywhere, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and stingy. <br /> <br /> In any event, the chiefs of the conversation, the main character, speak of harmony and enlightenment by drawing the hearts around her body with a magic mark, and she continues to walk with a more peculiar look in her eyes glazed over the eyes than she was. <br /> <br /> I want two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are a few random quotes I've come to remember: <br /> <br /> "What I think is unrealistic is more realistic for me, and this, which I used to be real, is often less realistic It is not true. " - Some speak of the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does one man need to stand up?" He takes only one idea: nothing changes from the outside, all changes are present, yet he suffers from an erection "- there Sophie declared himself, Her own. <br /> <br /> [While looking at herself in the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you! Fat, you ugly! I have!" - The main character, fat and ugly photographer.
