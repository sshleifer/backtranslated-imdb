The bulk of this film seems like a "specially made" television effort. The trend is the fist of pork, and the representation (except for Fred Gwen) is hunger and soap. Dennis Crosby, in particular, connects her lines like the cold he reads from a braid card. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching, as soon as Gage returns from "Semetary". There is something disturbing about watching a young child kill someone, and this film may be more than some can only deal with for that reason. It chilling chilling. This movie only works on one true thing, but it knocks this thing out of the garden. Worth watching only for the last 10 minutes or so.
