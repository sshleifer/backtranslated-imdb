It's amazing to have this movie in one of my songlists. It's by far the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I did not feel bored before (luckily not for more than 1.5 hours), pre-teen attempts to humor this feature do not even come close to getting one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. After the very embarrassing first part, the other parts tend to be a little better at least. I hope you go in vain, but it only descends from there. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling at all and this story is repeated three times. One can only hope that all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever, and that Trent Harris does not put his hands on the camera again ...
