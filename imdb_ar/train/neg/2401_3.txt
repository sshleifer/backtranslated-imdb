I have watched the best wolf teenager movies in my time, but this one takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" in the cheese festival. The quality of the stars in this film is not bad. Only the way I made it just sends it down. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a footballer in all American schools in the 1950s, who ended up not growing older because of a wolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was the violin player. Everyone led Patty! Ed McMahon plays his very conservative father, who has come to an end. Adam Allen's father plays a role in the contraction that does not appear to be at its highest level. After all these years, it seems that Tony is misplaced by the attack, and then will have the opportunity to seize his mandate. Laughing more than bloodshed, this movie is just a beginning in the eighties, and "Teen Wolf" was an improvement from this! 1 of 5 stars.
