Remembering the dirty details of this hateful "movie" is like digging into your chest cavity using a salty rusty spoon. "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) may have been a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most amazing marketing shows I have ever heard of. A boy fights spies / terrorists when he is at his home alone in a suburb of Chicago with chicken pox? Ironically! Why should this film be made? I'm the type who thinks that horrible movies are not a waste of time, but learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. Must be avoided at all costs.
