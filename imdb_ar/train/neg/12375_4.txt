The good thing about this is at least entirely new: there are no movies about dance music and the club scene (even if it's set) in cinemas. It radiates a lot of energy too, from music to filming Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that he can not decide what he wants to be. Although he certainly likes to be ridiculed in the line of "Spinal Tap", the companies also realized that they would not want to play a game of imitation. However, it largely fails on jokes because they are not very well written and most are undeveloped characters. And does not have an arc in its text and guide it to 90 minutes, why not edit it to 75? The production and cinematography department is still trying to save time (for example, Paul's house). <br /> <br /> In a strange and unexpected way, everything is over, Pete Tong works better as a simple drama in the Almost Famous line. The scenes with Beatriz Batarda provide some of the power. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess, it's fairly fun on a basic level, but it's best to spend a night at your favorite club.
