There is only one word for this movie. Awesome. The director obviously has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has the potential, but Kray can not bother to use it. Crowe's attraction to British youth is to get caught up in a small crime and then go down to corruption. Like the British newspapers, this young film depicts without ambition or respect. Cried Cray attention, but he deserved nothing. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by the violence that Krai chose to make in the faces of the public. He assumes that the public is ignorant of world atrocities. Like a piece of outrageous graffiti on the toilet wall shows us the corruption of males with the joy of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Some actors of quality have small parts in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both appear in a short match. Representation is otherwise amateur, young Joe and Ben making cringe. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer creepy. Miranda Wilson plays the role of Monica, the wife of famous chef Jonathan (Michael Howe); how she was able to subjugate herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. The film is never hidden, and Monica treats the most unwarranted acts of violence wrought by war. The images of war are used to convey the idea that young people can not help themselves and that violence will occur within "civilized" countries. This is certainly true, one of the symptoms of our changing society where males are increasingly less important, but Kray descends to the barbaric male level he seeks to reveal by using such brutal and violent images. Female characters in the film do not offer any comfort. They are either victims or in the case of manville or washed. Society is represented as functional dysfunction. <br /> <br /> This is Carrie's first film. I heard what he said during a Q & A session in Edinburg, which is not unwise, he simply lacks experience and his film reveals his naivet√©. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company will explode because the public does not really need such a kind of conflicting material.
