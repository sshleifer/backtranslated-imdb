0.5 / 10. This film does not have anything good at all. Acting is among the worst I have ever seen, and the truly amazing thing is that everyone is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. Trend prank, low budget is hopelessly clear, the result is appalling, I can not say that the film was edited, the excessively brutal clip will be more appropriate phrase. It combines serial killing, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It is not scary at all, and the lame special effects are hopeless. Very bad throughout. The writing was very bad. Cinematography is a cheap real-looking, and very grainy at times, and working the camera is appalling. Again, what the film really does is how poorly all actors perform. cheesy.
