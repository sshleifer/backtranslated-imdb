I may not be a critic, but here's what I'm thinking about in this film. Well, I've watched the movie on cinema first of all, I have to say how much I hate the story story, I mean what frightens a snowman next to little children; secondly it's great, but I bet because the movie budget is very low maybe they They use ketchup until my vote is a bomb !!! Try a beautiful sequel and will suck twice.
