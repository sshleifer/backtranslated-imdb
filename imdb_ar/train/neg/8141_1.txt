Watching the movie "Lives By Night" makes you wonder, just who in the world shines these craps marries a newborn couple on their honeymoon, and they are attacked by bats and the husband starts jogging in his clothes that attack various people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then skating, and then in a small town that looks like it has nearby mountains. The town runs Sheriff loves watching him and has a personal vendetta against a checkered doctor boy. The ski hospital runs a really wonderful man and a thick thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Cowell. There is not much tension and the end will leave you full of anger. Special effects and make-up teacher Stan Winston did the effects of this movie. I think you should start somewhere.
