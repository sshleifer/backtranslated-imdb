It is hard to believe that this is a complement to Henry Fowl. It is hard to believe that the same director and actors participated in both films. While Henry Bean is refreshing, intelligent, comedian, fei rime is slow, dull, and does not go anywhere. Where did the wit go? I'm puzzling. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Bean and many of the dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fei Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or gorgeous (Jeff Goldblum) - blame is entirely on the plot, dialogue, and even some movies (low budget is not an excuse). Great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to this plot, I was very bored, and very disappointed ... If you enjoyed this, you may not enjoy Henry Fowl much ... The movies certainly enjoy nothing to do with some of them Some ... there is no continuity in characters personalities ... it is all a scam to attract fans of Henry Fole to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm turning this off now - Henry in a prison with the Taliban?!?!
