In the modern and very good Batman the Brave and Bold, it is time to take a fatal blow to this mistake in Batman's life. Being a great admirer Since Tim Burton's first revival in 20 years, I have been able to accept different tones in character, dark or camp. This one can not be trusted: lots of effects, bad plots and a few questions. What's great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, optimizer and so on. Batman shows him only in karate days. By the way, how can a penguin be able to achieve this skill when jumping into the air regardless of his great talent? Take a look at Joker, a combination of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and the typical Reggae man, what can Batman admire in such a betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without the "The" in front of his name.
