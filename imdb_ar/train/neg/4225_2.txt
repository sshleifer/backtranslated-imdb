This film is another Christian propaganda film in the Omega Code line. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but because most propaganda films sacrifice honesty and realism for the message they want to convey. If you enjoy styrofoam photography on street life and how the Bible can change life, you might enjoy this movie. Say, save your money and hire The Cross, The Switchblade or The Mission. When do Christian directors sometimes learn to say bad words? It was frustrating to see criminal photographers who were not allowed to divide (huh? Criminals say bad words?) And flat characters I can not really tie. Also, it would be nice if the movie showed some T & A. Now this will be something I would pay to see. Who was the barrier that compared this company and a thin film chip with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
