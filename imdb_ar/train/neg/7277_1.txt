"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst film ever created, surpassing even Plan 9 of Outer Space. At least this film was incompetent; the Lambon film, on the other hand, was incompetent and mediocre. Once, films respected the intelligence of their audiences. However, this person carries rotting rotting corpse to our faces - and then tries to rub our noses in it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good parts of the film are the scenes naked and I agree that Miss Gansl and Dusenberry are a little bit of meat and very nice meat. But it seems that managers do not realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround them. There is nothing of this here. <br /> <br /> In general, filmmakers save the worst. The third part of the three sectors is the most treacherous trio. In this short article, Robbie Benson, a police officer, is passionate about reporting the service on his first day at work. Coupled with Old Timmer tired by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we give hope that this film will end with a victory. Certainly, we believe that the brave attitude of the young man will lead to ridicule and change it for the better. <br /> <br /> Desperate hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the spark of the young man is extinguished forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the toilet and asks us to follow him down the sink. Nominally, this is a comedy. But where is the humor?
