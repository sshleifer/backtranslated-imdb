Eva Longoria Parker plays the beautiful role of Kate who died after being crushed by an ice angel before "I do" with her fiance Henry (Paul Rudd). Two years later, Henry has not yet moved and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloan) is very worried. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk to Ashley as an attractive psychologist (Lake Bell). Ashley is communicating with Kate's spirit in the hope of helping Henry move forward in his life. When Henry's psychological attraction begins, Kate's ghost seems to break romance in her infancy. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the essence of the film. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard, and Wendy McLendon Coffey. I personally thought that Bill stole the offer from Parker. As usual, the pain in the ass. This film was still exaggerated.
