This kind of suspicious film really takes a dive into this one. The big problem is the lack of perception. I realize you need to create difficult situations that may cause suspense and a nervous feeling of what happens next, but this film was highly anticipated, which is not reasonable. I find that whenever I watch this kind of film, the more I constantly tell my actors to get things out of danger. Constantly making bad decisions just limits to being a normal idiot. If they take the time to make it more realistic, you may have enjoyed it a bit. Having said that, you may be better off walking away from this.
