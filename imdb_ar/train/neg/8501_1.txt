<br /> <br /> This movie takes a lot of time. The movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert) reminded me, which I found very boring. And "Semana Santa" is simply a poorer film. <br /> <br /> Only the virtuoso in the film is doing something for this film, Alida Valley. Alida is one of the oldest old ladies in the history of European film. She loved her crazy looks in "Suspiria" and "Dario Argento". I will not spend more time dealing with this film. I'll say something else good about this movie ... use it if you want to sleep very quickly ...
