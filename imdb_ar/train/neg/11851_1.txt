This was a disappointment - none of the difference from the original. It seems that the British are able to produce a really disturbing film with no of the best historical details of the American version. The original series combines both scary stories and accuracy with great attention to lighting and settings. I have watched the series several times and am still fascinated. <br /> <br /> Just another weak adaptation similar to the appalling adaptation of "Cracker". Stay in touch with the BBC America or BBC Canada and watch some delights like waking up dead, ghosts, silent witness, and Judge John Dide. Watch the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" to get Robson Green's more elegant and correct performance. Hollywood needs a look at this actor!
