This was a terrible waste of my time. No plot. Representation was far less than equality, and should be used as an ideal model in representing classes for what should not be done. It is just a trade rip to the former World Soldier, which also removes the barrel bottom of the proxy. It is sad that the VD needs to confirm the ego every few years, and it is still sad that people pay good money to sit through it. This type of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad reputation. In comparison, it makes Segall, Norris and Arnold seem almost talented. <br /> <br /> VD may need to take Leslie Nielson's path and perform such transmissions. Then at least you can laugh with him instead.
