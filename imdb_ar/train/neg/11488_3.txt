It is hard to imagine that anyone can find this favorite thing if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know humor is very personal. I've seen all of their audio podcasts (by far their best IMO) and I found this one of their weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> This year (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 pants and one feature. They were very popular and their boss Hull Roach benefited by keeping them working constantly. In addition, this was a trial time for the Wustan book. I would say it was an experience that did not really work. As someone else said, it does not play for their strength. Lots of dialogue and conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The best part of this for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan while Agnes the maid and Tilda Todd were great talking about the "girl" stuff. <br /> If you really want to see the boys in their most creative and fun situations, see Blotto or Brats of the same year. <br /> <br /> They have made a lot of short films in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for getting out fewer shorts. They made something like 108 movies altogether. Very few (except those provided in FOX) were explicit failures but there are some. The County Hospital, I and my sense, The Life Just, The Fixer Abyss, come to mind as two basic weaknesses. But some of these guys find something wonderful in all their pictures. Completely recorded in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen all of her other shorts and enjoyed them, you should definitely check that out, but I'd be willing to bet that this number would not have been forgotten then to Stan and Pep.
