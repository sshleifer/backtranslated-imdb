My friends, Sugar and Bobby Lee, are kidnapped by threatening men one day shopping and returning them to an isolated island. The girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were 10 years old and that there was wealth. All this is only a film that promises long memories of the first visit of the girls to the island and the ensuing fighting with the cannibals. <br /> <br /> This movie behaves extremely horribly by all participants pointing out that I am starting to feel bad about poor Hank Woren who really deserve much better. As far as I do not like "Barracuda" (located on the same DVD), I must admit that this film makes one look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: One pair of breasts (may belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My estimate: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Additions: Old ads for different types Meals; trailers for "Bonnie Children" (Nudity features), "Centerfold Girls", "Unintentional Wife" (Nudity Features), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive". DVD also comes with "Barracuda" in 1978
