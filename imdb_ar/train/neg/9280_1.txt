Frankly, I do not know what is funnier, this appalling new version, or comments on this forum. Review masterpiece I had to cry, this is very funny. Anyway, this movie is among the worst films ever and is definitely the bottom of the cascade barrel. The name "Omen" made me the title stop it and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face of the other three, especially the original. There are a lot of bad classic moments, but my favorite is the man who shoots the charlatan in the psychological show !! happy times ! This film is for Omen series what is "scary movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
