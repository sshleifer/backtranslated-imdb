This is just awesome, garbage really terrible. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and have sex. But while this may work in a pornographic film mechanism ?? Could it even be a success as a porn movie? This tries to hide himself as a "film" with real things to say, with true passion and struggle. not like that. It's an excuse to get some naked girls and have a fun time. I am sure that all these women (and men) in this particular film could have been fit in pornographic films in the 1970s. . . But not in the business of the actual film. <br /> <br /> Wet, very bad, I mean real awful. Writing was worse. Can not I blame these actors? They had nothing to work with. The structure or plot of a very wide film can be done well with good writers and competent representatives. The very broad structure or plot is one that a psychotic man spends his time shooting people from afar like a sniper. These shootings were driven by men who did not respect their women. If there is more writing - better writing, much better writing - and a less disturbing sexual image, we might have something to deal with. <br /> <br /> This movie must have been filmed, made and marketed for a pornographic film all the time. It would have made more money. It's practically a pornographic film, and the only non-pornographic movie I have ever seen is a male penis.
