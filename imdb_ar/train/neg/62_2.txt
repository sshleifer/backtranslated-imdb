swing! Is an important film because it is one of the remaining films produced by Black Film and produced since the 1930s. Many of these films have deteriorated so badly that they are inaccessible, but the film is in fairly good shape. It is also a great opportunity to see many talented black artists in the period following the peak of the old Cotton Club - a time that everyone has forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the movie is historically important and has some beautiful performances, it is also in a mess. The main plot is very similar to musicals in Hollywood - including Donna Beduna that will destroy the show and the unknown surprise that does not appear anywhere to save the day. However, the writing is just a god of magnanimity and sometimes a little garbage - and a picture of black America that some may find a bit humiliating. This is because before the plot actually begins, you are treated at the expense of no account living outside his diligent wife (a stereotype popular at the time) and when discovered with the pussy (which, by the way, completely overcomes this role), they have a scene-like fight from WWE Smackdown ! One lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight haircut - a truly full-fledged scene! Later in the film, when Pope Donna acts abhorrent, her husband hates her on the face and applauds him all! It seems that the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience as well as they can not do this well - with some of the worst works I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> However, if you can overcome poor production in almost everything (with crumbling characters, misbehavior, direction, and poor writing), this person may be worth a peek so that you can see excellent singing and dancing. - as well as to capture the forgotten black culture. Do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's really really bad!
