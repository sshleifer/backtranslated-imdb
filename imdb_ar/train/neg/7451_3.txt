Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It starts up interestingly, but loses its way a few minutes after the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) do really well. <br /> <br /> This may be because I saw a dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quidd was particularly wooden and disturbing, and Danny Glover does not really make a believerable rat. Moreover, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story at all (save saving one main character life at some point, but this scene is necessary like a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-) <br /> <br /> Talking about unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really a tangled story full of words: the investigator (of course!) Settle a personal question with the villain and suspend him (of course!) From his official duties with permission of personal entanglement. Wanted killer (of course!) * To be tracked * Play a cat and mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do not know the number of movies that are based on a similar scheme - mostly the best, however. <br /> <br /> The plot contains a lot of holes and lots of unreasonable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute or work well with the story at all (such as the sight of a truck stop or car on the edge of the cliff etc.) <br /> <br /> <br /> To overcome this, the end is trying to be original and exciting, but it fails completely in these aspects. We've seen * Finals much better with a similar kind of winter landscape setting eventually in the winter battle ... In the end, there is the supposed influential reunion of the father and child. ... Hockey, at least.
