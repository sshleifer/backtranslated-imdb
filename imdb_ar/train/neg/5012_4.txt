I watched this movie on the basis that Amber Benson rocks and Nick Stahl are great in general - I thought that any film that showed actors I loved and respected could not be bad. In that sense, I was right - given the interesting dialogue that had been given to them, both were doing reasonably well. Not enough to prevent the film from sucking, as you understand, but not enough that I was able to achieve during the 75 odd minutes of the film (this is the key to a terrible film: when, within 40 minutes, I pray for it to end). <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with problems in "taboos." The dialogue, as we have mentioned, is horrifying; Jean Janes' actions in January are very bad, and since she is the character we spend most of our time in following up around the house, that's an unforgettable flaw. The plot has managed to be so complex that it makes no sense at a time when cliches are so predictable that they are fully predictable (literally, no one will be surprised by the main "transformations" in this film, anyone but a small child). In addition to some interesting footage, the director tries to make a very big effort with very little success, critical tracking footage and a turbulent camera action that distracts attention from the storyteller. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars of this movie have been given the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last one is tossed on the grounds that one of the jokes made me wonder a bit. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
