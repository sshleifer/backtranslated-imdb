From start to finish, this is the most emotional film about anything I've ever seen. The characteristics and interactions between the character of the title and that of Martha Clare are purely torture. The race track as a gimmick is so overrated that it is bordered by cliches, yet Pulk treats every turn as if it were something very important. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is some value to restart MSFT3000 for some scenes, such as Pacino getting in touch with the inner female, to get the idiot value. But, even such a casual humor is difficult to find in a college Turkey.
