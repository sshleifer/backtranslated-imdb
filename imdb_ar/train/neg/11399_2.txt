I can not believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film I kept hoping the situation would improve by the end but the boy was wrong. The plot was very bad, the acting was very bad and the special effects were terrifying. Not even the beautiful girls managed to revive my interest in this dull and bloody mess. Although I can not lie, some lines in this film are as memorable as the Asian boy says: "I lost my virginity to babysitter until I gave birth to stereotypes." <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time with this incident Unless you are ready or want to laugh well .. maybe this way you can watch it to tear this movie with some of his colleagues
