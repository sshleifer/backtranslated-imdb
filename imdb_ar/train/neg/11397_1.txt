This was really awful! She had an awesome story, was badly disposed, and was like a remake of an amateur of evil death but not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> I have required all my stability to make it through this, it's a good job I do not have to visit another toilet I doubt I'll come back! This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big Hollywood screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film was the endless supply of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to let your friends after spending a night in the beer, this is right for you ... and avoid it like a plague!
