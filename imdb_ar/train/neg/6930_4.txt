Dr. Tarz Turgon Dargon is about a journalist traveling to a madhouse to write about a new style they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon discovered that things were not apparent, that the asylum was run by patients, and doctors in cages. First of all, some parts of the film are completely boring and make you want to sleep, and interesting interesting parts for all the wrong reasons (man thinks he is a chicken, for example). I must admit that the story is really good, but the film itself bombs. The music of the film is really weird, and like something you might hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene where the dancing guys are dancing, which made me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Category: R for violence and nudity.
