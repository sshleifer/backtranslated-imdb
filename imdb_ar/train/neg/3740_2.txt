Immediately, this film was ridiculous. Does it not have a replacement aspects? For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scene. Anyone not living on the east coast should know that the South has no beautiful mountains like those in the west. I knew it was Utah off the bat, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying it was a southern city. His vandalism in one south was easier. The film certainly contains distortions, but its false sense of place was something I could not get past. Not like Utah does not have meth labs ... That's why the writers think it's necessary to pretend that the south is out of my control. <br /> <br /> Something else always moves me. Why do they always do the "pictorial" sound effect when the personal pulls a gun automatically? It seems that all the other sound effects in this film were "chuk-chich" which shows a loading of 9 mm and ready for release. Of course, weapons already contained hollow chambers, so it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fireworks were in the foreground. But hey, this film targeted a certain "market segment" I suppose it is too bad. Each actor can act, but this film was lame.
