Scary Movie 2 is certainly the worst in the four films, because there is not much conspiracy, bad behavior, very boring and some joking jokes. But. These are great but, there is one good actor, one frequent joke good, a good start. The good actor is Tim Curry, one good joke repeated is the fake foreign trick with a disgusting hand that always does a carnage but laughs at the valuable stuff. A good start is a parody of the Excorsist. <br /> <br /> The Scary Movie 2 plot is the main characters of the original and a group of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night in the creepy old palace, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good but if you feel bored you may also see it!
