This movie has one recovery feature. At some point, after someone was attacked by a fairy carrying an ax, his brother asked him, "Why do you have a dick there, Chuck?" After suffering for almost an hour of the bad movie, I made this drink almost come out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some acting is not so bad, but all children are stinky and PJ Soles should be ashamed of themselves to do this movie. The story is weak and no one does what you think (or dictates logic) should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are lots of story points that do not accumulate. For example, in a scene, the ghosts of young children must strongly focus on moving a material object so that they can prove their existence, a difficult achievement since it is clear that they can not interact with material material. However, minutes later, they all picked up the branches of the land and won the "fairy tooth" with them. It seems that they can sometimes move the matter and sometimes they can not. Go to figure. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and courage, though ... some cute boobs. But this does not compensate for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about Tooth Fairy, hire Darkness Falls. I think it's great, although many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it determines the mood.
