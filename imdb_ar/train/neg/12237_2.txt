Rudolf's original clay: very good. Carton lukewarm: Needs a little work, but it may be worse. But lukewarm and Rudolf together on the Fourth of July? Come on! Give me a break !!! This was one film that should not have been made. was bad. Not so in any holiday in particular, except July 4. Making it very bad as Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. Any movie can be destroyed by a lot of singing. Repeated songs made this movie seem much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix two familiar Chirstmastime characters with a traditional American holiday (which seems to confine it to America), a very large number of meaningless songs, and a dangerous form. The result? A bad film can not really be seen at any time of the year. I would suggest you give up this movie even if you love Frosty and Rudolph.
