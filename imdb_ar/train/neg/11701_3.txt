Another example of why Stephen King's books are not translated into movies. (Even Carrie, one of her best, has been destroyed in adaptation from one book to another.) The story hypothesis revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he was brought down, although the incident was something of a mistake because he was not paying attention while driving. The father of a dead Roma woman puts a curse on the three, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner every day. Although the film kept the book, for the most part, and has the end of your typical, but the representation was delightful and felt tired. We have moved from one scene to another without much of anything in between, such as reading works such as the play. King himself made a film in a movie (like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors must remain the same: the authors. Leave acting for actors. Not that anyone in this movie was great. I have seen the main characters in the films where they were much better.
