I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would try their sister, Ryan Phoenix. I am sorry to check it out. It was embarrassing and the film has this strange plot if that's what you want to call it. Sisi was just a stranger and Gillian sat just on the toilet sleeping with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been unhappy in my life. It was just full garbage. I can not believe that actors agreed to do such a waste of films, money, time and space. Sisi being a "pretty" did not get me. I thought it was everything else. That thumb was just stupid, and why would we care if she could go hiking? what is the point??? 0 out of 10, it's a shame that the poll does not have 0, not even worth 1. Hopefully, the rain will be better in other movies, I've forgiven her for this performance, I mean I will not do much with this film.
