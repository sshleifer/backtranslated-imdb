Revisiting the Hawaiian dynasty ... filled with clich√©s that are highly predictable and unrealistic and even stupid at times. If you do not have anything better, it provides 40 minutes of simple, uncommon entertainment, endless looks of great male and female muscles, and good photography of the magnificent Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, if you are looking for anything more, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, if you have worked in no time at a hotel or know anything about running one of these Hotels, you have two options: 1. You will feel nauseous every two minutes amid stupidity and elation in how to show the program for Business Hotel, or 2. Consider it as a science fiction comedy as I did, rest, relax, laugh it!
