I am a fan of the original book and this amendment is very bad. First of all, I ran into a problem deciding whether to play a child or an adult, which caused a strange mix of adult story and some very violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving "funny" moments at first. <br /> <br /> But this is hardly important, the film is simply boring, unaffected and untrue in the original story. He simply fails to convey all the points that Orwell tried to highlight in the picture to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> A second revolution? !! Did they learn anything? Who is Napoleon next? Benjamin? !!
