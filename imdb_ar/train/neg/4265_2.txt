I am a big fan of Warrior Films. Some favorites are Braveheart, Troy, the Last Samurai and Gladiator. After watching the Mongols, which is very wonderful, which I highly recommend, I had high expectations of the film Sergei Bodrov. But it was awful, awful, and even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I was waiting for something exciting happened, but it did not happen, then I expected at least a great epic fight in the end, but even those were very disappointed, just some random running, waving swords ... There are a lot of good warrior movies, Not one of them.
