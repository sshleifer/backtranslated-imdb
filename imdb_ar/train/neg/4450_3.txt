It is clear that Julia Roberts is making a concerted effort to get rid of her beautiful woolen woolen personality with this erotic story of husband abuse, but it is hard to imagine that she will perform a strong and persuasive performance (and won an Oscar) as she did in Erin Brockovic based on the back of this trash . And do not make anything about it, nothing more than a Julia Roberts car, but unfortunately, its performance is not the most dim things about it. <br /> <br /> The plot contains all signs of late night. Against the cable, and do not leave the impression that he will give any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because the characters are drawn enough not to really care about them. <br /> <br /> Disappointing and ultimately unsatisfactory, without the Roberts name above the title, I'm sure it was possible to flop quite, meritoriously.
