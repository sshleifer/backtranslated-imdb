I can not believe all the praise for this film. The play and the film had a rip of Sleuth. Michael Keane wished he were Olivier, and Reeves wishes he was Ken. Even Cayenne had the nerve to do a new edition of "South" with Good Law playing its original role. Good Lou? You mean the person who did a new edition of "Alvi"? <br /> <br /> This film was made during his career at Kane when he obviously had to pay off gambling debts. He was doing nothing for money. He starred in such award-winning films like this, and "Behind the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be driving praise on this film is the death of Reeves. It's worth better to remember for this bad film. So does Ken. This film can be found in a box of $ 5.97 at Wal-Mart. Along with gems like "island" and "blame it in Rio".
