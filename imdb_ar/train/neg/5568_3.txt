Dolph Lundgren plays the role of the former cop / boxer who is looking at a strange scene in Boston to see who killed his brother, who was well thought out in society, but along the way learns how his brother enjoyed exotic sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very well prepared in this film, in fact based on his performance here, one may forget the rise of Lundgren to the roles of the movement. However, the Lundgren article does not give anything to work with, in fact, leaving Lundgreen completely to dry in a bleak, unpredictable and inexplicable film. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good. In fact, the film works best when it focuses on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, and the film really took time to explore their relationship, where the film was fairly adequate. However, the film is weak, the motion does not exist, the plot did not give enough exploration (too much boring B. about Lundgren investigation about the employer for his brother), the film is strange and unnecessarily ridiculous. Again, Lundgren is really good (as with the newcomer Daniel Brett) but the film flops from one sequence to another, making this film particularly disappointing. If there is anything else, it shows how weak Lundgren, as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 - (Poor)
