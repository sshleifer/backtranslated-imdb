You are ready to go with the original _Cruel intentions. _ I was in line with this plot and remained loyal to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this film, in my opinion, was essentially trivial rework with the same storyline and lack of clear personal choices. I did not really care about what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I was not so clear that IMDB read that this film was supposed to be a prelude, especially since the title contained a number "2", I was expecting a series, but then I decided it should be a companion piece. On the whole, I must say that this film read, at least, a pornographic version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
