This film should be called "Plan 9 by Joseph Smith". I think his love is not appreciated. It seems that the playwright has read Paul Erlich's "Population Bomb (1968)" and formulated a special musical response for the Mormons. The whole point of the play is that having as many children as possible is part of the "heavenly God" plan. Anything that stands in the way of having more children is very bad. Get it? <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. It is Utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was actually written in 1973, and of course, theology is part of the 1840s, part of the Galaxy Star Wars. Some events occur on the ground, some in the "pre-existent room," a hopelessly romantic room where troubled children wait for their bodies to get down, try not to close the door to the missionaries, and lose their shots on heavenly heaven. /> It is very fun as they please, but do not let poor plays spoil your appreciation of this malignant Mormon universe, where "young children" control the population, (presumably) advise their parents did not have any more children! , At the time the play was written, was the cultural standard in the society of the LDS, and the EH M is considered to be part of God's plan.To make family planning an option for parents, large families are far less than the cultural standard now, making the full theoretical philosophy of the film for modern Mormon images! <br /> <br /> ahhh but it's really just as good Music, and there are some interesting tunes here that will not allow this movie to die of the death of the seventies that was destined for him .. The brother and sister sing some love songs to each other which makes you wonder if anything else was happening there - wink. Babies and toddlers make new kids in the area look like Metallica. So cheers for it all! Gather the family around you, make some shooting games and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
