No, this was not one of the 10 worst films in the 1980s, but it certainly beats 100 movies somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years, then released in 1981. Otherwise how do you explain the special effects dating back to the pre-American Wolf in London, the disco is still fantastic, Ronald Reagan is not the 40th president To the United States? While we are in it, let's not overlook hairstyles in the 1970s in the 1950s and 1960s. I've seen more of this here than Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley combined. <br /> <br /> The only woman who uploaded the movie to the category "Too bad, it's good" is the late, Elizabeth Hartman the great, but barely. Biff plays Miss Montgomery, a high school teacher who has become a normal adult, a stereotype that has been implemented so far and is still being penetrated by Hollywood so far, but she still retains her character as a hot chick. Her call for help is proof of that. They also look much better like Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon, they shot hell." You were not kidding. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good parts anywhere else, they are few and far between, and I do not say that just because I love Hartmann. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. "Teen Wolf Too" was better, and it was not that good. <br /> <br />
