I watched "The Flock" because of Gere and Danes casting because the story story was interesting. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I saw some turkeys.) I did not publish them on the Internet before, but it was very awful and I had to do it. I suppose the problems start with a script that was so amateurish that it was incredible. The story is illogical and the dialogue is very vulgar. Poor Gir, it's worth much better. As for Gere / Danes on the screen, because of the terrible writing, one does not believe any of the characters for one minute. I bet Gere wants to be able to buy back the negatives, was that possible. It is shameful to see the talent lost so badly, let alone wish I could recover my watch. (I know what you're thinking about.) How do I really feel?
