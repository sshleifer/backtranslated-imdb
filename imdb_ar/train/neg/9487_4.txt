The team though there is nothing special, but they all do a good job, but the story seems a good idea, the texts are possible, and the end has a good development; if, what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> At first, special effects are very bad (if done in the 1960s). It may sound good, but in 2003, there is no excuse for such poor optics. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover proudly claims "from the author of the special effects of the Jeepers Creepers." <br /> <br /> Second, the trend is weak, this film does not reflect the essence of the story, a doctor must be feeding the souls of hospital guests to the devil (or devil-type creature) tense or scary; it simply is not. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fairly poor film, and although it is possible and enjoyable at times, it is best to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
