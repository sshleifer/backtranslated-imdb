I recently saw this film at a film festival. It's the love story of an unemployed former alcoholic who just emerged from a major depression and a middle-aged woman working in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of cliches, taking the "social" theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The main actor did a good job. He certainly looks like an alcoholic, but Anna Beilin does not believe her as a working-class woman. She behaves, behaves and speaks just like a "high-class" woman. What I mean is that Anna Beilin is playing her part. She does it all in her movies anyway. The whole scene of the film was so bad. The imaging is ugly, not used very well at panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue seems entirely written and boring most of the time. Typical sitcoms of Gomez Pereira, but in this case are not funny at all and are poorly solved. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you love previous Pereira movies, you may enjoy it a bit. Anyway, I came out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder what the director feels when he sees someone coming out of one of his films, especially the film made to please everyone.
