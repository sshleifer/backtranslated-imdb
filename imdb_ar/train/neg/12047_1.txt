I had the greatest enthusiasm to go to the premiere of this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to humanity, and was one of the first epic stories I read when I was a child (even before Tolkien). I must say it was a big disappointment. They made the whole plot a joke and turned it into a long soap opera. The elements that were faithful to the plot were scattered around in a random way that the audience was often laughing at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex figure like Achilles (who has a strange mix of forces almost like Matrix, absolute cruelty and male fans in the original poem) turn to "Fabio on the Beach" in the picture of a house with a good script and more effort can turn this To the most complex and original warrior figure of Hollywood production ever). Actors were actually decent, trying to make the most of a ridiculous scenario. It was actually a waste of many talents (Peter O'Toole stole the show, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are pathetic). Compare it to a LOTR or Gladiator and do not even hold a candle for them. Lots of ladies' batons to protect but not enough battle scenes for the movie that revolves around one long battle and siege. I do not recommend that anyone pay for seeing this dirt story as if it were one of the characters (at least they got this part correctly).
