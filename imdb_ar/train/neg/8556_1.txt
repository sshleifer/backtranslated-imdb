Well, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the demographic era, and I'm dealing with some stories. Even the meaningless dialogue sometimes seems almost unreal, and in a different film it could have been forgiven. <br /> <br /> I try as hard as I can not delete this movie as others did, but it is not so easy when filmmakers do not try at all. <br /> <br /> Editing in this movie is terrible! Probably the worst edit I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to the cinema school to learn, but good editing is not one of them, but the identification of the bad one is. <br /> <br /> Also, the shot ... oh god shots, just awful! I can not even go into details, but sometimes we see random things appear, and this in conjunction with the modification will give you the most painful viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This movie that is created on a low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not too sorry. I've seen short films on YouTube with more technical integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what you're thinking about, but this movie is just a masturbation for both Grover. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In the end, this movie looks like what a really lazy amateur movie would be if it was full of 3 or 4 poor sex scenes separated by long tedious conversations and a disgusting scene. If this is not your type, avoid this at all costs!
