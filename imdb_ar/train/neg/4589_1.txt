Do you remember the smoking channel that was detected in 60 minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people reviewed this film without checking the good intentions of the directors. Producers used counterfeit promotions "verbal words" with great success without disclosing the financial and philosophical foundations of this marketing story. If you believe in guidance, reincarnation and abandon the new era and the old calm, this film is suitable for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not a fool, so you will give her a handful of your money. If you can get to the site of Ramtha without a howl in disbelief, you might think that the money you dropped on this crazy information was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
