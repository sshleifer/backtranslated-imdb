Although The Flock has some good behavior by veteran Richard Gere, and some shots that can hinder the silence of days, the film runs from its credibility to the point of collapse and destroys itself against a plot that really does not go anywhere. br /> <br /> The film revolves around Erroll Babbage (Gere), who works in the safety department and is preparing for retirement. His office directs him to replace him, Allison Laurie (Clear Dance, Stardust), who quickly discovered that Babage was obsessed with his job. This task is not very enjoyable. Monitors hundreds of sex offenders who are conditional in his jurisdiction. Allison goes with Errol in numerous calls to check his "flock" of criminals and learns that he desperately needs to retire. But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods are not as well. He makes fun of sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by showing the past of these delinquents. It is this "good justification" that challenges the public at some level, allowing us to know the extent of Erroll's brutality and yet become the extent of his non-contact (by being very close to his job). <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl disappears in the "Errol" area, he jumps immediately until she is kidnapped by one of his herds. But how can you know? Is Errol good in his job? Allison defies him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles became as fierce as Erroll needed to find this lost girl. <br /> <br /> Although the story setting was good, he did not have any umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, who plays the character of Errol very well. Fighting the retirement. Concern of everyone close to his flock. Disgusted by those who is in charge of supervision. He disgusted himself because he had to do some things he did. Great change in personal portrayal of Jerry. But behind him there is not much. Some groups are fine (dark and dangerous) but there are lots of other problems that should be funny. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspension of disbelief is necessary when watching movies. But this comment has limits. The biggest push against these borders is the destruction of scenes of extremely vital crime. Someone as careful as Erroll will know that moving the body would be great. Or trampling through the crime scene. Or transfer evidence. He has gone beyond this film and has not been hurt. <br /> <br /> The other devastating part of this film is that we never get into the character of Claire Dennis, Allison. She almost fell by the side of the road at the end of the film, and we are never familiar with what her intention might be: will she stay or leave? Will you end up like Erroll if you stay? This is not a terrible film as it touches some of the uncomfortable moral foundations, but the whole story needs to be tightened.
