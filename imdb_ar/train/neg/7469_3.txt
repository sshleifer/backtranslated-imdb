The TV soap opera script is so bad that even on a. Hopkins was at some stage to play like a first-degree drama student, so that some life would give him his dead personality. I do not know if this is the purpose of the director, but Hobo Siano only liked vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. Maybe the real Ciano was all that, but why did he make a film about him? Mussolini was more persuasive, and his long way was as if he were closer to the truth. Ida Mussolini was silly (not because of Sarandon, but because of the helpless scenario), while she had to be the central character in this alleged family drama. See it only if you enjoy the Venezuelan soap opera.
