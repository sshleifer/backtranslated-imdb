This film delivers. The best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to ride the bike away from the incubator and in the background it seems he has not been anywhere near a bicycle in his life and is trying not to fall. <br /> <br /> But this film does not stop there. In less than 5 minutes, it presents a scene with nothing but an arm that runs across the fence and in a file that pulls beer. <br /> <br /> Typical grubby parents, many lines of plots that do not go anywhere, and a former seaQuest actress with a Bluetooth cell phone add them all to make this a perfect Saturday night at home.
