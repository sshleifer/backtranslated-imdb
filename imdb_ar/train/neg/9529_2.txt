This 1977 cult film contains two gay lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who appear at the home of the wealthy social physician Dr. George Manning (Seymour Cassell), hoping to help find an unattainable housing. But these two have other plans in mind when they discover that George's wife is out of town, ending up taking control of the house, restricting George, and killing a boy during the destruction of the place every night. A strange and disturbing film, but they are rewarded only by the strange way the film ends. Most of them will hate him directly or get caught up in this funny film after about 30 minutes. In both cases, some consider this a classic cult. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
