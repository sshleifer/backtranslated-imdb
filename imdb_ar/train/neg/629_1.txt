I really want to give this movie 10 ... I really do it. Some movies, especially horror movies are budget so they are good. Surely the wise ninja scarecrow that could carry out herds of corn as a deadly weapon ... certainly fits the "budget to sparkle" system. The depth of the film is certainly the point of its strength and sprains that it executes and saves, making the audience at the edge of their seats pushing the creeper ... the ninja ... stricken by puberty ... the student before the age of 30 ... drawing non-cowboys ... honest correction. .. Scarecrow son prostitute in the lights as a frightening icon of the year. All I can really say is: "Can you dig it" and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this kind of funny horror. <br /> <br /> (What the hell are they smoking !?)
