Failure. The film was not good. She has the humor that children aged 5 years do not even laugh at. I mean, of course, some of the parts were amusing, but most of them are not. Lindsay Lohan is a fantastic actress (and a bad singer,) and should work on better films. The movie should have been a Disney movie, and that's free. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well executed on this film was music. Nothing like a remodeled rock band to calm your day. These songs are very good. Especially Allison and Amanda walking on Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, Beach Boy, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If you give her ten, the music will be 9 of them and will be the song 1 movie. Not worth your money, but the sound is.
