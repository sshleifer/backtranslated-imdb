"P" (or Club-P) should be labeled "L" for the gimp. Every festival feels disappointed, and this is the festival that failed to live up to its big area: "Thai lesbians fighting monsters". Instead, this is the tale of a rustic village girl whose grandmother taught her a little magic together with some individual (but specific) rules: "Do not walk under the clothesline," "Do not eat raw meat," and "Do not accept money for Your powers. " Well, guess, people, the girl goes to Bangkok to collect some money as a "bar girl" and she can break all the rules taught by the grandmother, later called the evil spirit that kills "foreign aliens" who pay for her services. <br /> <br /> Although this film can not even be released in Thailand because of its controversial theme, most American audiences will find that this thrilling horror is a cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire" "As directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If this is not the case for some scenes that contain large amounts of blood, it is likely that the MPAA rate can classify this for pre-teen only. Literally, although you expect a sexual scene at least given the fact that the film revolves around a brothel and that one of the actresses is a porn star In the "lesbian" angle, there is a brief hug and two "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are actually a couple (on the brother) and the P-bar must be a club. The only strange dance on the planet, where girls keep their sexy cloaks and perform an exciting carnival (there is a swordsman who cuts the cucumber from the girl's mouth ... oh, phantom images). No nudity, no real monster If you think of a five-foot-tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), no adult should ever pay to watch this kind of stupidity except for DVDs. You have been warned!
