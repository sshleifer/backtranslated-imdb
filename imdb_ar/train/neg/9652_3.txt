The film was written 10 years ago and was another planned with SRK and Aamir in leading roles. <br /> <br /> The film was now produced with Vipul Shah and Ajay and Salman starring together after the decade of HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM ( 1999) <br /> <br /> However, the film is short because of its handling of the 1990s and the worst gaps in it <br /> <br /> The film tries to pack many commercial ingredients, Everything is predictable, deceitful and clich√© <br /> <br /> There are gaps like how Ajay escapes from London airport and makes the place for himself without anyone? Even the way his band starts is not convincing. The second half improves with the development of Ajay's story that destroys Salman but unfortunately, its climax is short and the film ends in a bad state. <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah Normal to Below Music Average is the worst point, most songs are modest < > <br /> Among the actors Ajay gives his best shot although he was not convincing as a rock singer but he plays a negative role in Salman yet gets angry with the Punjabi and modern nonsense he only stuns when he gets anesthetized and then Asin is not a great thing just a piece of show Ranvijay must adhere to MTV Om Puri just fine
