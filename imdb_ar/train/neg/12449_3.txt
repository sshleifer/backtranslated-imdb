Sondra Locke spreads in this film, but then she was an awful "actress" anyway. Unfortunately, you are drawing everyone else (including Clint Eastwood, her real-life boyfriend), but what Clint Eastwood was thinking when he agreed to put a star in this film - to be true, an exceptionally weak story, Or a plot at all ... Add to that, bored, weak representation, even from the normally good Eastwood.This movie ranks first in the top pile of natural sleep enhancers, and wow, could the film be more boring? Grass growth may be more fun.
