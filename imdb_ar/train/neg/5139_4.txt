It seems that many horror lovers like the scarecrows, so I would not be popular to say that I found it somewhat boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag a lot. I think the main problem lies in that everything is in the dark. Sometimes, horror movies that appear in the dark (like Humongous) can act, but the scarecrows in the dark for the entire film. It is often difficult to know what is actually happening, and although some of the shots in the scandals were creepy, it was hard to see most of them. If more lighting is used, it may have been better. <br /> <br /> There are not so many movies that contain deadly horror as far as I know, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that more of the scandals any day.
