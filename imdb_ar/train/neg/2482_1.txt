(Spoilers Spree) This is a very awful movie. First of all, this guy has an average. I think he had a career playing the role of super-parents. It was ok the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but after 10 minutes they did it again! Needless to say, this film moves in the clutches of real time. At some point, I started filming a few days later, until I was reminded that the story line was only the next day ... Early in the afternoon still! I'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life. First of all, they are brought as a kind of couple from my Manhattan husband who grew up and grew up a boy. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These species have stopped driving Volvo for decades. Today they drive Prius. But in 2002, I'm sure they still do not drive Volvo. <br /> <br /> Well, there's Wendigo. "A mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small Wendigo figurine and tells him his powerful charm. Come on ... Do we still do old Indian puzzles. Just to bring him home, they walk around every Indian statue in their tourist trap in New York City. American Indians are portrayed in a way that the world has not seen in decades! Oh, about Wendigo. It is not really the cause of terror. He does not kill the father of the child who is the most horrible thing in the film ... He was just killed by a plain heck with a grudge and a powerful gun. Wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the man who killed my father ... Oh, but wait, Wendigo looked earlier that he was mad from Dad, maybe because he killed the deer ... so Wendigo must then be happy to kill Father ... but ... <br /> <br /> So, it goes ... humiliating, boring and unreasonable. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
