I was very disappointed in this film. Surely he was weak on the ridiculous border: the souls that can influence reality the way it works? A task that seems crucial to the hunters of the soul entrusted to one of its younger members? The story was complete B with "holobrothel" and the suit filed against the station was so awful that I once aborted the TV, "Why would I waste my time with this?" <br /> <br /> From the substantive point of view, the "river of souls" did not really enter the question of the soul any deeper than the original "Soul Hunter". We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Are there any female hunters?) <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first chapter - were very moving. But overall, I would say I give this one a miss.
