Judging by some comments in the IMDB, I was expecting a film that we'd considered - perhaps a dramatic, stupid, simple one or comedy, but basically action. I saw, certainly did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (although the preface is trying to look complex). Take three interest groups: 1) Government 2) Rebels 3) A group of killers. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first set (never appeared in the movie). Then, simply, make one of the killers, the princess, of the rogue in a vengeance. Add to the rebels love interest with guilty conscience. And you have ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still can not turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random movement sequences and some exotic images that try to be science fiction with a low budget, what keeps you feeling empty. The film does not look like a movie, but it is a strange, incoherent and boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
