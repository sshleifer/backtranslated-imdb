This is a typical example of managers with high technical skills for videos / commercials trying to make their first full-length movie. On the one hand, the pictures, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have the look and feel of "really expensive". Even actors show a certain amount of potential - even the point where even the best actor can not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not a bad plot, but it's hardly a conspiracy at all. <br /> <br /> 50% of the dialog box consists of "What the hell was this?" , "What was that?" And "What the hell was that?". In any case, any of the characters or audience is provided with the simplest hint of the answer. In most other dialogues, one feels that there has never been any form of dialogue, and actors have had to improvise freely into a plot that has not been explained to them before. <br /> <br /> The only reason Skye Bennet may have done so well is that her personality as an autistic child did not allow her to give the terrible, tragic lines of dialogue that other actors had to deal with. In this way she was able to show her acting talent that the rest of the team could not get close to. I mean, there is not one representative in the world who can make up for a dialogue like this: Ben: Is this true, huh? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Comprehensive psychosis, huh? John: Someone has to control this situation. Ben: I can not control this situation. Not by you, not by anyone. Emily: Not on your side either. Ben: No <br /> <br /> I got a cry of terror. But not to horror, and more to try appalling. At some moments I felt ashamed that the actors would add to their reality. <br /> <br /> Two excellent artwork.
