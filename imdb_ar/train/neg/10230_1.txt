Update a copy of this. Not me, and if I had spent my own money on this I would be finding officials and demanding it! All I can say is that this will be a terrible student film. No understanding of the middle of the film is absent. Awesome representation, the story of the original twilight zone series has been rejected as a non-authentic and lame, the change in the tone of the leading personal reaction to the "stealth" is funny. <br /> <br /> You only agree that the "glowing" comments of this movie are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not terribly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Amateur at the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
