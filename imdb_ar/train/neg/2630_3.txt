Alarm spoiler! ! ! Personally I do not understand why Pitt did not help save Williams' life, I mean it would be nice to know why William was motivated, or forced. A member of the Secret Service, now has clear and well-known motives. But since renting this movie will not please you, causing the old but used twists, the average representation - these are just things in this movie, to keep you waiting for the end. Johnson's director, Swat, has done a much better job this time, and I still wonder how producers (for example, Michael Douglas) left the movie to the theaters.
