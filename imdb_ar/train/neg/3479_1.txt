I went to see this film in the cinemas and was shocked when I entered the room. There was only me and my friend! This screamed to me that this film is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was awesome. Ben Affleck plays the man who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable story and falls in love with the girl he hates. His acting is acceptable, but for the comedy side of the film he is not good. The plot line is lousy and the comedy is almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family collapses and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop others from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room !!!
