I'm not a technically inclined individual. I'm a woman with a scientific mindset and I felt that this film was probably one of those films with sandy labels on the budget. I saw part of it with my fiancé and my future daughter. We tried hard to find something in this film to keep our attention. My fiancé and daughter voted, and we moved to the 13th place of the ocean, but that's another story. In order not to be deterrent I woke up the next morning and was given another shot. I began to watch this film again seriously. I did not get it, I thought I would get it. I thought that the funniest part was to throw out the ash and find a jar next to the fireplace used as a vase for what seemed like dead flowers. Interesting and still have things dead inside. It was a strange film. Maybe this is what they were after, but I will not fool again!
