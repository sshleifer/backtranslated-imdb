I've seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals, and it always makes me feel like I've seen a trailer for the movie! <br /> <br /> For a school film it is produced and directed very well, but the story ... well, I needed something else to be a big and enjoyable film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some approaches. This is something that lacks some short Portuguese movies - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
