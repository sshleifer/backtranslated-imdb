Scary .. yes scary !! Crowded with nudity (from fat people to thin people), Maslin Beach is located on the nude beach of SA. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in two years - it's safe to say that it made a strange subject discussion at school the next day . This movie was terrible! Barely a romantic comedy - just a show of nudity! This film reached a low level with one of the characters of the New Age, who is staring at the legs of girls. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Nah, but I think I found paradise. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this, unless you want to hear amateur actors discussing topics such as dumping, adultery and genital mutilation. Avoid!
