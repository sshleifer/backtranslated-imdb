We have been given these two stars to get the clarity of the shooting DV shot wonderful, which gives a cold and dark to his personality. This was Karma, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie has failed in all accounts. I can not recommend this, because it is neither poetic nor explicit. No dramatic, no suspicious. Not controversial, nor ordinary. It's just a piece of miserable garbage that no fan of terror can use in good faith. <br /> <br /> You do not see this, who are you. . Please, just keep away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
