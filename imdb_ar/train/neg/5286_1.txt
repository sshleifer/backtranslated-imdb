I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and I asked the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could watch it without waiting forever until it comes to the United States. I really should have saved my money. What is with Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point of Ann Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. It's not reckless and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? Her speech was not natural, and her journey was not normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made the "romance" all incredible. In the final scene, they even had Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Rot wore during the message scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 version, which, although flawed, remained close to the book. The book, I do not think they read it. This is kind of like Clive film reviews to impress. Hit all the high points without explaining anything.
