Not the greatest film Paul Paul Nasche remembers. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Prediston) may be the worst player I have ever seen. Zoro will be ashamed! His only salvation came because the competition was very bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as an adventure and a horror. Forget the horror - there is nothing. No nudity, no blood, no monsters. Just a Robin Hood adventure against the evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film was the vision of Graciela Nilson, who produced only four films in two years and our film has lost an unfortunate loss. where did you go?
