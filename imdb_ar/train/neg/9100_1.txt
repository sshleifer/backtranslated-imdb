Christ, Christ ... You have seen one of the most amazing and amazing hours that may be distorted, as this dull, loose-smile exercise unfolds with all the brilliance and brilliance of the fake Galapagos tortoise. Can these be things? Is this film already there, or have I been an unintended guinea pig in some mysterious global pharmaceutical companies, and sipped my coffee unaware that it has been heated with serious hallucinations? I saw a lot of movies and a lot of bad movies, but nothing prepared me for it; in the end, I was a wreck, he was ripping the carpet with my teeth like a dog, and clutching the walls, so that my lungs were painful. I desperately begged to sympathize with Mercy (whom I did not know), and longed for the craving for a soothing balm for Oso Yasujiro. Sweet Jesus weeps, memories ... Sometimes they return to me. When I am in my most vulnerable situation, when I am less able to deal with it. I tremble, and I cry with tears, I hit my nails until my hands are stained with blood, but I can not keep away memories of the terrible past from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell man. <br /> <br /> Other user comments here indicate that I am not alone in being subjected to this terrifying experience, which can mean only one of two things: a) that the film actually does exist, or b) I am one victim of Between the hordes of an international conspiracy of truly evil proportions. Surprisingly, some people seem to have enjoyed their plight, or at least have not been traumatized. Maybe they are part of the process. God curse them, crazy! God damn them all to hell !!!!!!
