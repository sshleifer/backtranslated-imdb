In a panel discussion I attended after watching this film, filmmakers said that one should look at this film not as a film but as an instigator of thought. Well, the only ideas that were raised from me were wasting time watching the movie. The tricks of the film (documentary style, future environment) were a deviation from what was supposed to be a deliberate examination of the abortion argument. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring film that preaches the choir.
