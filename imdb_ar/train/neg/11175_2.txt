Unless someone enlightens me, I have no idea what this film is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it is far from it. This film tells a senseless story about a New York press agent and his problems. That's basically it. When Pacino plays this factor, one must think that it must be something important. But it does not take a hard thought to see how much the film's meaning and humor are. To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone") deserves the title "the most boring and most useless picture of the year." What's going on, Al?
