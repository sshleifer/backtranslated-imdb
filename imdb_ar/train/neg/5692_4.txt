The film is a disappointing move with an interesting hypothesis: a young mafia killer (Chandler) must prove to his boss that he is a good man to serve until he goes to California to take some lessons with a well-known professional killer (Beluschi). The first and most important task: killing a young woman (Lee) who is completely alien to them all. But is it an easy goal? The film continues and is based on this basic idea but the result is just a bad routine; even a strange twist in the end does not save the film. Good performance by Chandler. I give this 4 (four).
