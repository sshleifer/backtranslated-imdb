I've really started to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how his movies can become crazy. This special movie was quite a waste of time and a complete vision. My first complaint was the DVD cover where they studied the pic image. And make it look thinner and younger when it appears in the film as nonsense. He has his big belly and his double chin go with him and the most miserable and boring on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was absurd to begin and put forward a very long way. The entire film was leading to the end where Segal and his team were fighting a group of people under the influence of an adrenaline adrenaline chemical chemist. Much of the useless dialogue let alone the silly and persistent dubbing of Seagals even in the middle of the statement. The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite a comedy. <br /> <br /> The scenes fighting in the movie was awesome you could not even see what was going on. There were narrow shots of him flapping his arms on the camera and then the person who flies through the wall or anything. He reminded us of the old Kung Fu series on television. Many slow movement of combat scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is the worst Seagals movies so far and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or I would be very upset because I'm very impressed with Seagal the Aikidoist. The fading star moves quickly and seems to get worse with each performance.
