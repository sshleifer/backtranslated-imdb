This is an attempt by author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers in the film "Tarzan monkeys" Arab. But this film, made in the desert, does not show any of the faces present in the most successful Burroughs adventure. The focus is on love between the handsome English handsome Hall Hall (as "El Leon" Chatham) and the bizarre Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Ulya), with the revenge that occurs to coincide with her desire to integrate. The opening states that although he is convicted of improper conduct, the mother of the child lives - but has not re-entered the picture. Unfortunately, the movie "The Lion Man" has deteriorated, and seems to be missing the footage. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
