Simon Big plays the role of Sydney Young, an idiot foolishly Bret who acts as a famous journalist in this American comedy. After a very fortunate break, he began working in the highly respected Sharps magazine, run by Jeff Bridges in New York. She is the Devil wears Prada more than the dead Shaun. Kirsten Dunst offers an unlikely love interest that works well with Pegg for laughter, but they do not completely control the screen with emotion. <br /> <br /> Sydney is experiencing some emotional challenges while trying to decide whether he should forget his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine. Of course, he was eventually lured by the glamor of the celebrity world, especially the small star Sophie Mayes (Transformers Megan Fox). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder whether Pegg himself has ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UK's best-selling comic talent. /> <br /> All in all this is a forgotten comedy. Please return to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
