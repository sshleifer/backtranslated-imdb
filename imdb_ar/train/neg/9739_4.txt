Not so much that spontaneous respect had little potential. In fact, the unexplored title phenomenon is very interesting, and for at least the first half, Tobe Hooper's effort to entertain in a way that only the horror of the 1990s can be cheesy to do. But somewhere between the performance of Brad Dove to retreat again and the very complex plot, this excitement loses its way. <br /> <br /> Dorf, who appeared here before the accumulation of his fan base of terror, is the average guy Sam. Of course, ordinary men do not stay average in horror movies for a long time, so after a good outline of the origin, we see different parts of the body begin to ignite. He quickly set fire to other people, deeply alarming Gal Baliza, who played a prominent role with Cynthia Payne. <br /> <br /> While the title of the movie refers to a happy monster with fire on the ground, the director chose Hopper to make Sam a murderer unwilling. This approach gives the film an additional human depth that it may lack, but it also prevents us from truly fearing the launcher of human flame. We have left wondering whether this will play a better role as a vicious effort for everyone at all. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> Great respect is a very symbolic effort when everything is said and done. You will be more attracted to Dorif fans and those who can not get enough horror in the 1990s, be it good or bad or between them, but on a slow night only.
