This must be my film type. Even if sucked, he should still have been so sniper; hell, I love the films "Congo" and "Alan Kutermaine". I have a soft spot in my heart for alien films / demon / silly adventure. Let's move on why I decided to watch this in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-Fi is always always interesting to me. 2. I am a great admirer of archeology, and this film includes a rare treasure. 3. Super natural enemies with FX quality. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this film had potential, at least in the cheese horror section of the video store, but the boy sucked the ass. The only two sides to replace are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them amusing as I do ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now go to some flaws. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the film as a whole worse, Reed's performance is very cool. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about Tara Reid's nomination for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but the play of the curator of the museum no longer exists in her period ... completely. She was not watching as she was trying to get the list of the educated world very different from what you get in watching bad porn movies. I mean this is not bad, it's very bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, do not feel shame, but only to bra in a silly and unnecessary unnecessary scene at all. <br /> <br /> Even with the performance of Reid, it is possible that the film works, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot appears written by 10 years old. I did not realize that it was adapted for video games even after watching a DVD, otherwise I'd appreciate stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The story of the story goes back and forth from Slater's childhood in an orphanage where he recalls the memories of the past about something terrible that happened, and he suffers from memory loss of course. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by some units 713, an extraordinary military force suspected of catching evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was very rebellious, I think, you do not really know unless he was in one of those audio sums he invented. The film begins with Slater fishing, where he got his latest work after some dealings with "the Chilean mercenary force specialized in selling rare relics." I might have a totally wrong quote, but you got the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a wicked doctor who wants to unleash some hell on earth (without reason), experiments on children, demon / alien hybrids, lead "photon" (Satanic things can not stand the sunshine), of course , Slater and Dorf try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even walk around the vulgar elements. The script is in urgent need of rework to narrow focus and provide some depth. I mean, why is this evil world so wicked? Well, humans are doomed trying to just save the human race. I think he's infected? How did this happen? Oh right, he has one of the evil sinister things in the cage and pulls his blood to shoot himself. how did this happen? Why, where did he get the super mollusks (yes, they use the old science fiction platform for aliens / parasitic demons that "merge" with the backbone of their host) of course, the slater is, like a blade, a semi-super strong alloy, but its alloy " Electrical ", thank God. Oh, people who suffer from this "fused" spine, have no idea that they are half-alien / demon and serve as good members of society until a secret signal is given as they turn into a zombie killer. Yes we got zombie. <br /> <br /> Lots of nonsense that can be amusing, but none of them. <br /> <br /> Also, the end is completely stupid because everything turns out that it is not so big a deal that has to be fixed in the first place ... at least nothing the little dynamite can handle. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst thing you'll see, but it's a really bad movie.
