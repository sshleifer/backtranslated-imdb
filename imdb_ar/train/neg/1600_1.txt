The biggest national strike is still Lambon's "Animal House", which is right. It was funny, loud and good. <br /> <br /> The opposite of all other National Lampoon movies. Including "class reunion". <br /> <br /> Please do not fool you by including Steven Forrest ("Flounder") from Animal House. Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this mixed mess. This reunion is as hilarious as the root canal and painful twice. <br /> <br /> One star, this is a vineyard. Then again, I always thought that most of my old colleagues were demons, bloodbaths and serial killers as well.
