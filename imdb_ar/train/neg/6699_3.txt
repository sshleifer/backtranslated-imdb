"Algie, The Miner" is one of the silent and non-alien silent comics. The timing of the bird is completely stopped. This kind of humor with certain sequences makes you wonder whether it's supposed to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a mandatory show for film buffs mainly because one of the oldest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an influential man, acting pretty much like a typical "stereotype" in many early films. The film has a common homeopathic position at the time. "Algie, the Miner" is extremely awful, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (10/3)
