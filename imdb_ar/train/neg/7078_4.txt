This film could have been a decent B movie if 3/4 of the film did not focus on sex scenes. I mean that he is addicted to sex, and I'm sure there's a lot more going on with sexes out of sex continuously. Michael Des Bares did a good job considering what he was doing, which was not much. At one point or the other, one had to laugh at it, because his character was very trivial. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as a sex therapist and could not do much if I did not suggest having sex. The most prominent character for me in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her disguised role as a loving and interested wife. There is something beautiful about inside and out that appeals to me strongly. I played this role and when I watched the movie, I started feeling bad for her. <br /> <br /> A "sex addict diary" while not an Oscar or a modern classic of anyone's criteria, is very useful in doing just how the demons of the personality can handle and destroy the same things in the life you think.
