I bought this (it was only $ 3, okay?) Under the title "Gray Article". I was eager to see Sheriff Rusko in an amazing role. As other reviewers have cautioned, is a rather boring story of a very secret government experience. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are lots of confirmed shots, especially for the house in front of which a group. Some characters and interiors are not very well described and I think the filmmakers are worried that we may forget who it is, so keep telling us first about the exterior buildings. It's actually rather funny. After a moment, the snapshot of the pond seems like a motto for a television station, reminding us that we are watching Gray Matter. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two minutes of calling names. At one point the subject of an angry test ridicules a responsible person by labeling it "scientific b *!". It's just too insulting enough. Several scenes later a different theme lets off steam by muttering about this "scientific b ** tard!". It seemed very embarrassing to me. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will disappear forever. After another decade from now, it will be impossible to find any copies of it. As if it had never happened. <br /> <br />
