This film looks like it was made for television. I waited for a long time to produce a film about Robin Carter, because I loved to see him in the old MSG box, and to see this movie very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but it was awful and boring. There's nothing really good to say about this film except I liked the song.
