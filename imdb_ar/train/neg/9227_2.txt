CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every film I see in the theater is at least entertaining or has what I say. This film looked like it had been released by a film student about the introduction. To the filmmaking class. His father makes wonderful films. His sister made a good idea. But my Roman brother? No! One critic had the audacity to compare this film with Jodar Le Mripes (contempt). While Coppola Junior took the same idea, a movie about the film, he tried hard to make himself look European, artistic and brilliant, while the whole thing was just a technical collection. The main actor carries the same expression through the entire film, as if he were in a state of awe or in shock from the film he made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages his role as a frantic director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that includes any kind of sarcastic humor of the real film is, surprisingly, not the scenes of film B, but the scene that takes place in Italy; a collection of shots from several different characters in a very small car, driving around picking up and chopping random people. That was the only thing that reminded me of the movies I thought he was trying to fake. Or rip off. Or both. The documentary about bullets in the camera and shooting of different things was shown, and the end was marked for "evolution" or artistic value ... I suppose the most extreme thing about this film is the film itself, not the intended way. No wonder this movie has been sent back after the festival has been shown for re-editing or re-editing or anything else, which makes me curious to see how bad it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse than this. If you want to see a good parody of the movies, check out the Austin Powers movies. None of them. Opening up to the third is the funnier and more genius of this entire film. Lil 'Romy, for cinema, please refer to directing your cousin's music videos. Leave the godfathers to Baba.
