Although I had some hopes in this film, especially as I enjoy Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared much, I have to say that it was one of the worst films I have ever seen (Loser and Dr T) In that list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were moments of loud laughter, although the film could have been much better. It was not assumed that the illegal artists tricked their way into college where they met their game when someone discovered it with a suggestion. The problem is that the characters were so unpopular that I did not care about any of them. The extortionist (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was so sick that it was not funny to see him - he was not disturbed in a funny or particularly charming way, he was just a crazy loser, and was actually rather dangerous not fun to watch. It was difficult to follow the film's editing - it continued to differentiate between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear. Only two or three of the band's deceptions have already been shown, and you just had to believe that they were actually scam artists - showing their designs would have been made for a better film. The alleged love story was absurd and unbelievable; it was actually written and directed entirely. I can continue to address the shortcomings of the film, but you got the idea. Not worth renting $ 4 or gas it takes to and from the movie shop to rent it!
