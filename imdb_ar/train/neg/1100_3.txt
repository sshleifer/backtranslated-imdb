Since most of the reviews of this film have been on display since a decade ago, I would like to add a more recent film, which opens with a stock of German B-17 shots and a clip of Wust's Wasker Werner's Hauptmann (Captain) and his assistant character running In search of a cover as he makes his way to Führer Bunker from Hitler, once he enters the house, the information is extracted by the staff of his hideout, and then the film is cut into one of several scenes of conferences with Albin Skoda, giving a good impression of Adolf Hitler's mobilization to "Ultimate" Victory "while Werner's character comes slowly coming to realize that the inhabitants of the hideout are trapped Ron is in a fictional world - some of the unsupervised events are depicted, most notably the flooding of the metro system to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor sub-plot of a young member of the Flak unit and his family's difficulty in surviving. This film suffers from a number of inaccurate details A German film just 10 years after World War II is not included; the actor who depicts Goebbels (Willie Krauss) wearing Hitler's uniform, including the eagle of his arm - Goebbels wearing a brown Nazi party badge with a swastika badge - wearing an SS A scene well documented by Hitler giving the Iron Cross to a boy Finally, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a model of a Belgian-built color in 1922 - most agree that it was a PPK - some seem to be somewhat inaccurate with the fact that The scene of the drunken dance near the end of the film is remarkable, this picture is presented as a comic, with a wounded soldier drunk (his arm in a splint) moving ozi to the music while the nurse mixes a stripe / belly dance, all light Candles ... This is really embarrassing to watch the most unbelievable part when Werner Captain Wust gets on his own audience with Hitler of Skoda, Hitler shows that after she has fallen back on a walled seat, drugged and delirious, when Werner's personality begins to question him, Hitler screams at first, escorted by SS guards, The fake scene to any real historical novel. - Werner's death is then dropped in a hallway while Hitler prepares his own end, Hitler's farewell to his staff is displayed but suicide is off the screen, and the last second of the film shows the funeral of Hitler slowly turning into the ghost of the face of the dead Oscar Werner / Hauppmann and West - Is more than a historical risk, and anyone interested in this period would be better informed about more recent films such as a remake of "Hitler: the Last Ten Days" or the German film "Downfall" (Der Untergang) if they want to be more realistic For this dramatic story, these last two films rely on an eyewitness account of the person The first, with the film "Hitler: the be the day of the last day" g, was collected from Gerhard Bouldt's autobiography as Führer Bunker and "Downfall" as the staff of Hitler's secretary, Der Letzte Akte, "The Ten Days to Die", which is more than a compilation of the event (much obviously fanciful) of the history of eyewitnesses - surprisingly, the novel by Hugh Trevor Roper, Hitler's Last Day, was not converted to Movie.
