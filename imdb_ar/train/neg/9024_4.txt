"Shinobi" is one of those movies that think that just killing someone automatically brings a sense of heaviness or emotion in the story. Unfortunately, in order for the public to really care about people who die, you have to develop personalities, otherwise all you have is a series of random acts of violence. The problem is particularly acute when you have a lot of characters, and they all die. <br /> <br /> Well, so if you can not be bothered to make characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the reasons why they die reasonably, right? Both. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, neither side knows the truth of why they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. But even after it became abundantly clear that the Emperor wanted them all to die, they still refused to give up their meaningless tasks. This is not stubborn ... this is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Good, good! There is no evolution in personality, and this plot does not provide any reasonable justification for the fight. At least they die fighting in great motion scenes, right? Again, no! In fact, many battles are not even battles at all: the super ninja that the film spent a lot of time and effort in delivering suddenly dies (and lament, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I walk along it, I numbered * neck." The end of this character. Even in the middle of the film, I threw my hand at the frustration of irony.
