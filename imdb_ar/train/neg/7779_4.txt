A "real" story about a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins to pollute water. The fun monster movie, though not good, has a lot of people trying to get the monster and know what is going on but not in a complete way. Give it points to give us a giant beast they've built clearly to widen some of the scenes, but take some away because it resembles an unguarded drag. An entertaining movie is fun in the right frame of mind. (My only complaint is that the print version used in the Elvira version is so poor that it looks like a good striped video that was over 20 years ago).
