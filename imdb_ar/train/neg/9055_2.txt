Since I am a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, and his variety of skills, I noticed that this movie is on the list, and I was surprised that I did not hear it. <br /> <br /> I traveled more than usual during each of the period filmed in 2000, and when the theaters hit more than two and a half years ago (this time period is the first idea that all was not well with production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick can not work Swayze on sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up the difference between them. Charlize Theron is a person I'm happy to see, even if I showed her a dry paint watch. <br /> <br /> Since I'm curious, I've reviewed the production information for this site. He made a huge amount of less than $ 600 a screen on the opening weekend, and just over $ 400 per screen, after the month-long theater show in 2002. The total amount was $ 261,000, which I doubt could be Hotel, staff and food covers for a week on site. <br /> <br /> The story is very benign, and even the use of Renault's interesting language is usually as faint as the rest of the events. <br /> <br /> It's something like many SNL bits are all grouped together, nothing very odd at all, and the overall display is even worse. <br /> <br /> However, the expenses of this production must be substantial - even if they all work less than usual - so the only thing that has made it an unsustainable composition is the quality of photography and the present Billy Bob (though understandable) Here, compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> Think of these three great ideas, completely different characters in the "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa" and you know that he realized this work below standard , Long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this.One star for him, even here, and one star because the production was better than, for example, a typical "age" click.
