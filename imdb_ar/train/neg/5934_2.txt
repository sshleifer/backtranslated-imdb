I will not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. Yet he is an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. The most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his life and career. High temperatures and humility. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians who appeared at the concert did not reflect the subtle differences in Leonard's musical / literary style. Nick K, Jarvis Cocker and Pete Orton were two exceptions, although Leonard appreciated Rufus and Winrits' performances of his songs. <br /> <br /> What particularly failed in this documentary is the director's ability to let the viewer see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians relate. Much is said in this regard, but the viewer is not attracted to the person Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special symbol, but they can not translate the true value of Leonard Cohen. Collaboration with U2 is a farce. The whole live recording seems like a rush. As in the entire film, Leonard Cohen remains his only role and can tell about his role. <br /> <br /> The entire montage and scenario is very similar to a project outside of high school. Use effects such as echo, slow motion, or blinking images in a bad position. Some of the camera's work is bleak. Part of the result barely indicates any associations I was expecting. Sometimes the director seemed to add psychotic elements to the film. Maybe a reference to its use once for the LSD. <br /> <br /> Some unintended humor ... At some point Leonard tells how he influenced the genre. At first he could not remember the name of this type, so he eventually said he was a punk, street vendors had already chosen his music. The next scene in the film is a direct cover of "I can not forget" ... <br /> <br /> "I can not forget, I can not forget that I can not forget but I do not remember who"
