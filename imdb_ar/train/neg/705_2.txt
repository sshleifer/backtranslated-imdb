There is a little here from Anne's wonderful and senseless book here. Some characters - intense and sudden characters - do not reach the screen at all, and those who do it are so diluted that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christoph and Marcel? Where is the continuing relationship between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, because her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Mary, and her greatest characteristics (and their fall) are that she can pass to the white - and his marriage from Richard? Why does the film end up beating Marcel at the hands of his father? Do not learn anything about me after that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why not explain this hatred? <br /> <br /> For offers, there is no better than average performance, although this is probably due to poor software. The best thing about it is the actor who plays Richard - but Richard is not on the screen enough to save the film. Worse still, Yasmin Gay is in the role of Dolly Rose, although she returns to the actress who has nothing to do with the few things she has given her. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is terrible. I thought it would be impossible to have any movie turned by Anne Rice's book worse than going out to EDEN, but FAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look very successful. How would Rice such a slut allow her to do her best to become unwanted on screen?
