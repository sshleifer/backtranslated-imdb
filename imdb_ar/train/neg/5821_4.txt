As others have noticed, it was supposed to be a great hammer-style movie, and it seems to me that this is how most actors were directed to run it ... but the screenplay is very distinctive, fast-paced, full of boring and boring soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton) Burdened with mostly) that everything is overly exaggerated and self-important. This is an unusually weak performance from Dalton, although it calmly calms the atomic scene as Dr Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only successful actor is Patrick Stewart, a very welcome sight. Freddie Francis may be a great cinematographer, but he was a bad director.
