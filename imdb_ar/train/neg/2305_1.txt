This film made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the start. There were errors of continuity and conspiracies that suddenly stopped as they began. I was very disappointed that I loved the Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to who always trusted Danny Glovers and respected his taste in choosing his roles, "Grand Canyon" for example. I could not finish this film after what seemed forever, but maybe just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters that made you empathize with or sympathized with them, there was no excitement at all about this film and the clips of their past were poor editing, confusion and unnecessary. What would have been a great idea for a film, even if it was a drama and not a comedy (although I think comedy would be better because I like to watch white people go out and start acting like stupid, making me laugh) It became a waste of $ 1 credit in the video store.
