As a fan of Erik Romer's studies of contemporary gender warfare, I was very excited to see "L'Anglaise et le duc" to learn how he dealt with men and women during a real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie looks nice, each scene is designed as a period painting, such as the bio-paintings. I expected a lot of talk, because this is the Romer style. But Romer may have been restrained by attributing the script to a real woman's writing, which is why she often felt like a dramatic version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. <br /> <br /> As horrific as Robespierre et al, what about some recognition that the French aristocrats were pampered? I kept humming to myself: "Marat, we're poor / poor and poor;" You can also pick a tone from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I was not all that sympathetic as the central character had to go back and forth between her city and rural Manor to stay at the forefront of the revolution. At one point, her maid claimed that the store was a shame but he certainly managed to fine-tune it. I simply did not understand her; she sympathized with the English language and rejected and defended her former lover and defended her while he and the revolution continued to change the political focus; I think she was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than her political machinations, like the character of the "Pimpernel Scarlet." Hey, the only reason why she did not go home is her shame after an affair and a child with the Prince of Wales or someone. <br /> <br /> There is usually a period of change in relations between men and women in a revolutionary period, but I have not seen anything here. I went once to Herbert Marcoussi's lecture, which ended with a long question and answer; the last question, from a much larger audience member than us, was gray hair, "Why are the rebels dark?" It was caught and Markoz did not give it a serious response - but it's the only thing I remember all night. Romer explains that the anti-revolutionary is gloomy and pedagogical. <br /> <br /> (Originally written on 8/11/2002)
