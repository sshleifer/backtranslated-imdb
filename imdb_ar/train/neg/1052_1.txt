***** This review may be spoiled - but this design will be minimal in such a well-known classic story ***** <br /> <br /> Cinderella's story is classified as my favorite fairy tale. The world will not have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to see their own version of the story. This can not work if the story deviates or tries to throw out some interesting ideas with some magical designs and bad-intentioned and edited production designs. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is like an ugly duck that never hatch or rather, never turns into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the production value that money can buy, can not buy good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting. <br /> <br /> The entrance of Cinderella's ball as it did was bad, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> Writing made me very nervous, too. Prince Charming was more than the junk of memory. Why would any girl want to marry a poor prince who absorbs himself and hates women? <br /> <br /> Turner's role as the father's wife was an embarrassing painful show that showed one person more than just a simple representation. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella part had little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> One sentence may only describe this attempt: until the 1990's cheap, what should be mentioned and mentioned in a shameful surplus is glorious photography, unplanned design and production design. It was a pleasure to see the landscapes, collections and settings when the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella stories, go to Two Gemstones: Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Leslie Ann Warren. Even with the apparent stunning television - the 1960s to groups, this is the best version of celluloid - contains nothing. All stars cast every effort to provide the highest level of entertainment. Engage, transform and forget writing and music. This is the classic way. <br /> <br /> 2) Never - The jewel of Drew Barrymore maintains the historical perspective, changing the storyline but not enough to impede the effective development of the highlights of this classic story. Presidents' personalities and all supporting roles were cleverly written and acted well.
