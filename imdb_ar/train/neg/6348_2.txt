Totally humming nonsense. The material was boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast had made hooligans in previous Allen films. In order to listen to the wondrous words of Will Ferrell, Woody Allen's tradition makes me hate Ferrell of the second degree (despite her vague popularity). The 70-year-old Allen was supposed to have stopped working when he was in a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to participate in the film, but it was impossible; my snyapses could not shoot slowly. So, instead of snoozing and killing in the afternoon while I was sleeping in a straight position, I woke up, left my wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car where I had a really good book to read (Tommy George Bailey the Great) 30 years ago, The Germans. The day ended well, not thanks to Woody.
