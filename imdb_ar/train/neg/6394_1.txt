This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: the one-time comet was set in the cloves one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning, everyone, except for a few people, turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, and plants are still alive, but people have turned into dust. No bones, nothing. This is ridiculous. How can radiation burn people with leaving their clothes and other biological materials intact? <br /> <br /> Better yet, the culprit has turned some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup did not look scary to a newborn. The location of the craziest clown frightens me more ... It is supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were survivors. People who were surrounded by steel when the comet passed were saved from zombie death and death. How can steel mask the comets' radiation that is supposed to burn people down their paths? <br /> <br /> Equally humiliating is the 60th horror music that is played in the background through parts of the movie, or a rock of hair in the 1980s that serves no purpose in the film making you want to shoot your TV. <br /> <br /> However, the most stupid part of the film is its focus: two girls from the valley and Chakotai from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who will go to loot the day after the end of the world with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four horror scenes for 5 minutes in the entire film and most of them were dreams. Among these scenes is an unfinished dialogue that makes South Park look smart. The silence between the initial dialogue was painful. I could have done a better film with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Do not see this movie, ever.
