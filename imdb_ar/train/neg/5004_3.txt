Wow, it's ironic that this movie has been interrupted for some time, and I think someone else has reviewed it two days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie just because it contains Nick Stahl, to record. br /> <br /> The film was ridiculous. The characters pushed me crazy, they were clich√©s and two prints. This film had some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. There were a lot of plot transitions. <br /> <br /> There is one scene in the movie worth watching, but the scene: "Warm Heart, Cold Gun" where Nick Stahl kills the hateful girl in the bathroom. (Well, they were all really nasty). But his behavior in this scene was excellent. The look on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth watching but it is not worth watching the rest of the movie.
