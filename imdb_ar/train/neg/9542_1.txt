I do not know what to say about this terrible film that has not already been said. Frankly I only have myself to be angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this film that it would be a terrible part of the nonsense, but I loved war games and entered my nightmares. I will live regret this decision the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when the government people made it clear that their supercomputer could determine who the terrorist was just by how much they played a video game, I knew I was on a journey despite forgetting the good writing. The list of drawing lines, dialogue, representation, very too bad, too long, you will disable IMDb if you try to publish it. For those who said they saw the worst films of this film, please tell me. I'm really curious to see something that can top this steamy pile of horse dung.
