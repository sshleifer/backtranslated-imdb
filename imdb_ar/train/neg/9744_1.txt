This is one of the worst things I've ever come out of England, so it says a lot there. The tension when we have to know whether or not Limbach remains is amazing. The upper side is seeing the gentle secretary, Sheila, in her underwear table for picnics for a short time after being caught by Dr. Rat Vis. The film has many London scenes, though none of them are good. There is also a point where a car accident occurs and the heart rate returns to below normal. There is also an hour that is transferred remotely, and the fear of not returning the woman to her watch is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense" which is more boring and British. Add an angry gun battle between the British police and Dr. Rat, which does not lead to anything, plus electrocution for many people, plus a cat and you yourself ... ummm ... British film. The MST3K version is very good although it is not the best.
