I could not believe some terrible dialogue that comes out of people's mouths, and the end of the blasphemy associated with the film's body was a real cry. We got fantastic footage from Angelique Petitjon (of some kind) and Lauren Crabtree to take off. <br /> <br /> An evasive trigger activated by the psychic Angelique Petitjeon brings a strange container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olin Rai, it was collections of remnants from Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film an increasing value beyond how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Inside the container, a dwarf alien (played by Ray Jr.) who starts the claws of people to death. It was funny to see this little "creature" wearing a black reptile suit that looked like large beetle shells attached to it, spinning in the dark. So we could see a little tears and seal in the ET poster, which I thought was hilarious. <br /> <br /> Then there is something like a snake that comes out of the container that reaches the death of William Fair, after the tiny creature chews the neck of Frank McDonalds in the kitchen. I suppose ... A low budget on ALIEN, <br /> <br /> It all ends up suddenly, it seems like it ran out of the film in the end before the blooper reels with the final credits. He talked about the lack of funding ... <br /> <br /> Fred Ullen Ray also mentions in the director's commentary that he was not sure whether Aldo Ray would be caught in the shooting and remembered his lines. He hardly did. <br /> <br /> A little budget sneeze. It's fun to watch, I'll give you that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
