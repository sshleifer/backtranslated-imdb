If your idea of ​​entertainment you see graphic shots of people running in their cars (you will see a woman under the front wheel, and twisted as the car passes before you go down the back wheel - and show it twice if you miss the first time) this is your documentary. I recognized that I had not seen anything else from this very disturbing piece of exploration, but that was enough for me. The rest may be better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for TV networks to start showing slow movies. Game offers based on self-mutilation may be great. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are people who are confused in the world and are making terrible things. I do not need to see the evidence on television disguised as entertainment.
