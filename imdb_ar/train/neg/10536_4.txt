William Cook and Paul Talbot share the director / writer's participation in this low-budget entertainment film about three boys camping in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet backed by fire and joking a pupil back and forth ... A vagabond wanders from a comic town named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen of Luthorvas fame) and trades four tales of bull for food and warmth of fire. <br /> <br /> One of the stories is the old story of "The Hook", two teenagers in Haret al-Habib who were attacked by an unemployed assassin with handcuffs. Another story has two tokers you need to register some weeds. They stumble upon a man who knows a man who has some wonderful things. When they smoke several full bags, their skin begins to turn gray and green before they fall and fall. One of the best stories about an unhappy man returns home for Christmas, can not wait for his mother's death and enjoys telling his nephew and daughter about Satan Claus. The story of the fourth camp is a greedy sailor washed on the beach displeased with an empty treasure chest and zombies ending up at sea. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets a cross point and really can be much worse. A little tacky, but fun to watch except maybe a sailor tale. Acting does not deserve an award. List of actors include: Tress Holton, Courtney Ballard, H Rai York, Johnny Templin, Walter Kaufman, Kevin Dean, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
