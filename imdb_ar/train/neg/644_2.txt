We all asked ourselves, "Why do not they just reproduce the tortuous films that were just fine instead of reproducing the films that were really wonderful, and in this way they can only make them better?" Well with Prom Night, they remake Jamie Lee Curtis's 80's, but it's very fun, and made it worse. It is a film with numbers and clearly tries to attract young teenagers (and hence no violence, etc.), the knife in this oblique flick is frank. The director spends a lot of time focusing on trying to make the attractive killer seem rather creepy that nothing else comes out the window. The cast including Britney Snow (who was great at the hair stylist) is doing their best but the material gives them nothing but to do the trick and look for fear. More disturbing things are how to handle the scenes of death (we will hear the attack but we will not see it). It also seems that the only place where the knife worked in this film was in the editing suite because the film seems to have been slaughtered (guessing anything that ended up scary in the distance in the floor of the cutting room so as not to scare the kids) hurt the money from Americans who send this movie to the number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are very fun but in the case of Prom Nights made me want to download the original. I've seen OC rings and Dawsons Creek the most wonderful
