This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel perfect. The only thing people forgot about was the fact that the reason for winning the original was such praise, it was done by the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a passive type of guy, but the guy who acts in this flick is .... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante, and I am sorry that I spent two hours of my time and wasted my money on this click. I still love the original and I will try my best not to let this movie ruin my mind in it.
