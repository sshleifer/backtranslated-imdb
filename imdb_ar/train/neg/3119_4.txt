Robin Williams made a great show in The Night Listener as did other team members. However, the film seems to be accelerating and leaving too many loose ends to be considered "watchable". I think the problem occurs because there is not enough strong relationship between the caller and the nobility of Gabriel (I had to spell this way, because IMDb wants to correct the correct spelling automatically to the letter "no one"). The film runs to just over 01:30 and during the first 15 minutes, or apparently, N starts his search for Pete Logande, the caller. <br /> <br /> This happens after speaking to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not in depth mostly consist of how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why I came out of her boyfriend ... etc. In the book, the child almost shrinks back and vice versa and the reader understands why he went in search of this boy, once he discovered that the child disappears and thinks it may be a trick. <br /> <br /> In the film, N becomes obsessed with finding Logandy, but left the audience to wonder why? Due to the lack of a strong enough link between N and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know that there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and this relationship were necessary to establish them on the screen, because they provide the basis for the rest of the film. Since this does not happen, the movie breaks down. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of the other works of Mobin, the tales of the city. When it was converted into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
