Boy what a mess this mess. But it only takes one hour and I just pay for it so I will live .... unlike the whole group of 1933 clunker who are all dusting now. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, a small village begins to find bodies that have been dried out of all its blood. Local residents begin to talk about vampires, of course, loudly after finding each body. Or regardless of his identity, played by the wonderful actor Melvin Douglas, and tries to tell them otherwise. When the dead are said to have one large hole on each side of the neck, instead of two nearby openings, locals simply say it is a giant vampire bat. The policeman insists that the vampires do not exist and that he must be the human offender who commits the killings. <br /> <br /> But Melvin does not seem too upset in either case. He spends most of his time trying to reach the pantaloons of his sweetheart, played Faye Fay Wray.Also in this mix is ​​the town of Simpleton, played by Dwight Frey, who seems to have played the same role in every film he has done. It scares the city's population by catching the bat and drinking its blood. Lionel Atwell plays the role of a city doctor who apparently tries to help the policeman solve the crimes. He was stinking as an actor ever. Atwill is closest to being cardboard in this role you can get. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing .... a lot of big names to be like a pile of guano. <br /> <br /> Unlike the bad title of this movie, the alternative name "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this film is also boring and escalating and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For me the high point of the film is to watch Frye, he is painting the strange strange city, but otherwise he did not show this movie much. Then, when you discover the strange cause of death and see the effect that all this blood demands, I will really be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of terrible pictures, but at least it was fun and fun to watch. Of this film as a Lugosi claw is very bad without Lugosi and you will feel the extent of the mess that the chaos has suffered. <br /> <br /> If you can not produce a good horror movie in 1930, Lugosi has developed at least it.
