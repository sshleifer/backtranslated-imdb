I felt like I was watching fasting and angry again, but with different actors and a slightly different plot. I will say that the cars in the film are very wonderful. So, if you love fast cars, it is likely that you find this movie somewhat amusing. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from the days of our lives. She's a really good singer, but she was so bad that they gave her such bad songs to sing in this film. I mean songs about cars. Not exactly what I was here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood film, you have to present this story in a simple way, but I do not think any average atmosphere will encounter a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car and fix a car. Engine, and be the lead singer. All this is just silly. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone who wants to bet on 25 million in a race car is great. But it was kind of nice at the end when Natasha stops before the finish line and ends Michael's nails. Priceless. <br /> <br /> The end result: This movie is dedicated to car lovers. So, if you love fast cars, I recommend it.
