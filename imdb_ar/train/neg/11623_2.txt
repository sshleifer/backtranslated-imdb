From everything I read about the film, I was excited to support a film about a Christian theme. Everything about the film was very unprofessional. Especially writing! Without good writing, the film has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to give up the link between the title and the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I kept waiting for the back story of teenagers / young people to unfold, but they did not. As someone who passed the divorce period, I was very disappointed. This film was not comfortable with me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can cause in your life as a Christian!
