I love comedy. Although I have problems understanding the stories completely? Visual design is unique with all dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was. Surprisingly I understood the main plot? But some decisions are very bad as they are taken for their visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad appearance "CG human actors" - up close? ??why?! But it does not work at all !! Horus - and other Egyptian gods - were successfully manufactured in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors that this film could have been a cult film. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
