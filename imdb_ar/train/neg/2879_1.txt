This was the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First, I'm from Kansas, this film does not contain the truth at all. It's like they took BTK's name and the rest is made up. Moreover, it seems that someone was as if I only got $ 20 here, took a movie, and oh do not worry about looking for btk at all, just do something. Dookie pure seriously No one should see this movie. The scenes of cows slaughtering and making its victims eat things and describe the slaughter of animals BTK did not do any of these things but the film does so for the love of God does not see this terrible film at all. Made for TV is the best way and more accurate way
