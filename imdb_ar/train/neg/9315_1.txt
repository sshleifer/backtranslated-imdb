This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was awful! I can not stress it enough! The acting, the directing, the story, the characters and everything about her was bad! It was vulgar and cliched. Do not be fooled by the cover, or the "Texas Massacre" tag line is not something to laugh at. "Are you kidding" kidding me! It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first two minutes of the movie are so good that it reaches the main character Brendan, well now turn it off. What I got from the film was, a group of ugly, annoying and immature people go into the cabin in the middle of the jungle and a clown sings children's songs and kills them in non-original and fake ways. This movie was a waste of time and money and would be a waste of your money and time too! I made a quick progress through most of the film because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it was not worth it! Just looking at the lid is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: Not worth one.
