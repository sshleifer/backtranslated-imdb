Wow is all I can say if your reading was either seen or contemplated. Tired of watching it! <br /> <br /> I laughed hard at the many parts of this movie, the worst thing ever happened is very funny! I can not believe they imposed the school mark! I have to play this scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. If it is possible to produce such a film, it gives us all the hope of making our own films. Even the outfit was bad. It seemed like my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job of making it. I bet he could have acted and acted better too. All I know is that I should only watch the second part so I can see if the situation is as bad as the first part. It's a fantastic idea of ​​a deadly scarecrow, but much better work could have been done. Hopefully another film will come out of deadly scarecrows, not just such a movie.
