I'm sorry, but this is a bad film that's hilarious. Football hooligans argue at the travel lodge? suit? shades?! It is clear that Alan had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, as far from the truth as he could. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible choice ... Gary Oldman was a football hooligan? He does not look scary or act scary or even come across as someone who loves football. As for Yeti? what a hell? It suits you and your shadows and sitting in Travod makes fun of his childhood a bit with "the time you will get the nappy." please. <br /> <br /> The Yeti gang wears ICC clothes? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. The imprecise picture of the troublemakers' crisis is likely to be in the late 1980s.
