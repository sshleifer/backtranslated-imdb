I do not understand what the other review has said. This is definitely not a Bembo film, in fact, I do not think there is one decent looking girl. No, it's just a devastating science fiction story in the Ed Wood style. This is bad. I can not even begin to tell you how dangerous it is. I saw her late at night on the cable and I was in shock. The fact that this film was released at all is an insult to all of us. The actors were either friends of the product or mentally retarded, the special effects a joke, the pace is insanely slow. For me, music tops everything. The monkey can write a better theme with the Xylophone game. Do not rent this thing, but if you see it on the cable, watch it. You will be amazed at the seriousness of the film.
