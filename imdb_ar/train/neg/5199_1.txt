In the first 20 minutes, all possible cliches were discovered by the writer and the breakthrough director. There was a NTSB principal investigator with tortured family life. A member of the board of NTSB who was tortured politically and played [I can kill any TV] Ted McGinnley; the tormenting father of a crash victim; and the tormented torture lawyer in the ambulance chase. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of the plane. The crashed 737 was sitting on the ground mostly like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most people had to leave in light of the number of people who survived the plane, which was torn down in Iowa after losing its hydraulic components. Most of this TV was not burned. <br /> <br /> This reminded me of the scene in "Air Force One" where the 747 hits the water and then overflows as though it is made of steel with an inch thick. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to see it. Even my wife, who accepted more of me, was attached to the technical flaws. What amazes me is how to get these POS. Did the producers of these things get cliches so they could not even identify them? Someone read this text and said: Yes, I want to spend a million bucks to make this real. I wish I were dating the next man. I have ownership of a fabulous bridge in New York I sell at a cheap price.
