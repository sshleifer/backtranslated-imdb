special effects? good. <br /> <br /> script? terrible. No plot. No depth. no meaning. This movie made Superman as a meaningless hero, a hero without a prototype. In the original film, like America in the Cold War. Here, only the temple was represented. <br /> <br /> Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among other things. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that this film has never had depth in. I can not see how anyone can come up with anything meaningful from this movie, when Superman was, and still is, being created daily to be a meaningful hero not only in comedy but also in the minds of people. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could take. <br /> <br /> Only a few cases: Lex Luther could have been evil from global companies, political control, inclusiveness, and on and on. It was just a mute embodiment of Hockman. <br /> <br /> Superman? Why stop in this film? Nothing but a personal breakthrough "savior". <br /> <br /> Wait until it reaches the dollar scene if you ever see it.
