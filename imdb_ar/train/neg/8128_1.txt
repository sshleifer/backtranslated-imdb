Well, do not let my abstract fool you. This film sucks hard. But the worst film ever? This film was terrible in ways people should not have to carry their brains to describe. But it is no worse than Manus in any way: hands of fate, or blackjack, or the horrors of Spider Island, or a small handful of movies. As a review sucking the film, it is terrible. You do not see them without using MST or you may have health problems. But there are worse movies.
