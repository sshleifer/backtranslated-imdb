Waiting to go into ththre with tickets in my hand, I was expecting an interesting science fiction movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding Android technology, and instead I was disappointed by every aspect of it, proving once more that Particularly stunning effects can not help the boring plot, which in my opinion was the worst this year. The acting in this film is also dissatisfied with me, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I have never seen his representation changed since "The Men in Black" which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retire since then, not spoiling his name with nicknames such as "I, Robot" and "Men in Black 2". 10/04
