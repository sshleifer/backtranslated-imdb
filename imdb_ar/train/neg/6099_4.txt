This was a less dramatic short film I saw among the features of Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film was spread due to high-density technicolor, the film itself did not move at times, and the plot seemed very cheesy - like this was made for use in the classroom and attracting the attention of a wider audience was not even considered. In particular, I really hated the number of times things were repeated in the film - like when I spoke to characters, they used to say "Clara Barton" instead of "Madam" or "Miss Barton" or "Clara." In addition, a soldier from the sick confederation said that he was "Johnny Junib, a rebel, ..." - as if he were the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Power Girl. These were just filthy graffiti. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" in Superman TV) in a beard as President Garfield. Yes - it's under this beard.
