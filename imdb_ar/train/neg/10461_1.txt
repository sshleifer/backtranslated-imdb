It is interesting to read the comments of the viewers regarding the Code Omega Code ... has been raised a lot of positive comments almost predominant word from the broadcast TBN ... The film looks as if the move was made directly to the video, to be stored alongside the three part of The series of rapture by another religious group in the seventies .. Do not remember? You will not remember this one either in a year or two. This is the first movie I've ever seen where it implied that it's your religious duty to go and buy as many tickets as possible to save lives ... It's so shameful ... that this only shows me that if you're the son of a TV player, you can also play The role of Hollywood High Producer with Ladies of Lil Olyten.
