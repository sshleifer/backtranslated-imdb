This is about the worst movie I have ever seen. This film matches the quality of movies like "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those with names where this film failed. The "eye candy" for this movie seemed to be 50 women with a bad face lift. (Just an example of quality). You've rated this movie in negative if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that men were not bad at looking at them, but not so. If you plan on going to watch this movie, I highly recommend saving your money.
