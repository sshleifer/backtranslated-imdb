Swayze does not make very convincing Alain Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; who grew up was my final hero in films such as 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "Prisoner Zenda" and 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Suizi's failure completely. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatterman by Sean Connery in the Association of Unusual Gentlemen was very good at the great flipping. Alison Dodi also lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr as the lead woman, and last but not least, the great Sirik in the role of Umboba makes it extremely difficult for anyone to fill their shoes !!! For someone who was disappointed with the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, I highly recommend it now if you can not get the copy of the granger.
