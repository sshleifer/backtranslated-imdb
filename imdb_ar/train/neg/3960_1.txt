Hi, maybe it's because I'm not a theater pioneer or a sophisticated film watcher ... I think this is a "boring" and "dumb" movie. <br /> <br /> I hired this movie because of Charles Brunson, the title ... but the boy wasted a waste of time ... just watching the players sit in a cellar and talk ... <br /> <br /> The movie was on This DVD is "DARK" ... I had a hard time watching Dirty Film ... I realized it was 1968 film ... but they put it on DVD and then they have to do some digital restructuring. <br /> <br /> Also, I was quite surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this movie ... As I said before, I'm not as sophisticated as the other people who commented on this movie earlier.
