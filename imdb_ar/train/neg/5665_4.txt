This deliberate foreign adaptation of Borges' short story is Cox's model. His strong visual sense, as usual, is retracted by the shocking half-acting of most actors. The film is certainly in the surreal tradition of the Mexican period of Bonwell, and sometimes seems like a poor man takes on Lars von Trier elements of the crime. Cox's clear preference for individual songs, cut hops, and surround sound recording are all working against the film's effectiveness. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing.
