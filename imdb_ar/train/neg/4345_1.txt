Carlitos Way: Rise to Power "Scarface and Carlito's Way" LETS GET IT STARTIGHT ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, but was actually "an assistant to Scarface's Editorial Room." Not missing Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have had a little more. I think I can talk about the masses when I say ... we hate lying so blatantly. As far as the movie goes, it was bad at best. I think Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Louis Guzman should be ashamed of working in this film. Overall, it was not a good day at all for Carlito's Way. Obviously this project was an attempt to quickly make a good film.
