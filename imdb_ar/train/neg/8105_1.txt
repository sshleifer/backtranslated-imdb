Cruel, yes, but I call it "like what I see". <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80's and it was really one of the most horrible and tedious movies that forced me to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, the cinema is beautiful. The Czech settings are really amazing. The political background is attractive, but unlike "specific historical" stories (such as _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this story fails to make the policy relevant to the story, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film managed to make even "erotic" scenes tremble and slow. I am all for romance, but this film was very boring, I began to hope that the Russians would shoot all of them and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I was reading the book and the story would make it more logical. However, life is shorter than to spend any time at this time.
