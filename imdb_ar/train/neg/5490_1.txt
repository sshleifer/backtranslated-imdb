When I was a kid we always used to be babysat and we were always hired to rent a movie or watch a film in the cinema. This is one of the films we saw. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, and I think it might even be Walt Disney Pictures! Mars is dropped to earth, turned into a human being, a human being, and tries everything in his power to return home. But distracts him from the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can make is the selection of actors, back to the future Christopher Lloyd as Mars, Uncle Martin, Dump and Dems Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Pres Channing and Darrell Hannah as Lizzie. But apart from it being complete crap. poor!
