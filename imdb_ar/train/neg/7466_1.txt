Wonderful. Some movies just left me speechless. This was undoubtedly one of those films. When I left the theater, I did not have a single word. All I had was an urgent desire to sink my head in front of the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Frankly, this film has nothing to recommend. The humor at the first grade level, at best, was very na√Øve, and the plot was far from astronomical. I never promise to watch another film from Chris Kattan or any other SNL member.
