"Children like these" could have been a decent film, given the subject. But instead, the TV movie has become less than average, the latest TV movies a week, with little to do. The representation is old, the plot is predictable and the direction does not exist. For a better film on the same subject, try the film "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a film that really cares for people with Down syndrome. In "children like these", they are used only as an excuse for acute emotions. Very awesome. 10/01
