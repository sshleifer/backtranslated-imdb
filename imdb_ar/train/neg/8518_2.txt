I was amazed how many comments on this show revolve around how "real" it is. I may not be part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it ended up from the top in a great way. <br /> <br /> Representation represents the scene with enthusiasm and intrigues the holes a truck can drive through. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> It is very serious in wanting to be "relevant" to the extent that it only shows how much Rob Thomas and his staff have been cut off from reality. <br /> <br /> In general, I found it at its best snooze and at worst it was more than a little annoying. Christine Bell looks like she can be a good actor, but it's hard to tell me the full show style.
