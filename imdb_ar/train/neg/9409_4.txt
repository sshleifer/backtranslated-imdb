I liked this show I thought there was nothing wrong with it! Just that Spidey does not puncture any one but only for this offer is not absorbed! Some people just think this show is bad because of it. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes such as X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man appeared! Unfortunately Sandman never showed up but I loved him! Best Speedy view at all! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider War 3. The Hobgoblin Game 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot It was embarrassing to watch. I do not like Morpheus and Hydro Man. The first of Morbius absorbs plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. It bothers me that he was the main villain of season 2. Of course I must mention Hydro Man! It was terrible! I see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. I do not like Spidey as a Spider-Man! <br /> <br /> But I think everything from this was bad!
