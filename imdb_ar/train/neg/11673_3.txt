First seen on 17/07/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): A much lame story about the Titanic disaster is the first published version of this much-publicized event. The recurrence of this disaster is not bad, but the drama surrounding it is sometimes silly and full of vitality and resembles a soap opera. The story is very similar to the last Oscar-winning story except that we showed how the crew tried to hide the real disaster that was happening until very late. Good for nostalgic purposes only and find out what James Cameron was competing with (barely?) In his astounding.
