This is probably the worst film I have ever seen. I study French in college, so I understood every dialog box, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the film. There is only one professional representative in the acting team and I do not think there are any professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I have classified it as one out of 10, it is probably not worth such a bad rating. This is just a useless effort to reduce its current current rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Class 4.3 may be more accurate because the movie is an inaccurate event for 100 minutes or so and will never be repeated. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure some college students are busting his nut-making film twice good and half length. However, if you want to join a vehicle that seems to be revolving around IMDb, it may also go ahead "Lost in Translation" 10.
