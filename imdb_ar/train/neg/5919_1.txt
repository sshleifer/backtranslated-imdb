I hired this movie yesterday and can not express my disappointment at the small Laura Englis because of her participation in something that was produced very badly. I'm not sure whether the writing is awful or bad direction or both, but it leaves the viewer very frustrated in wasting time watching this trouble. It consisted of a weak naive story line, very poor lines, just adopted the beautiful scenery, beautiful people to sell. Unfortunately this was not enough. It would be better for you to rent a tape full of silence instead of wasting your time on this nonsense. Lindsay Wagner also played a pathetic role as a farmowner. He seems to be working very hard and doing nothing. Anyone who was close to a farm knows that this is clearly written by a young man from Los Angeles and not someone with a great knowledge of the world. .
