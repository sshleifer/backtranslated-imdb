Nightmare Weekend is a positive sign that some people are desperate to be "in movies" and are ready to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I am not referring to the countless women who appear to be very happy to appear starkly in this horrible piece of garbage (after all, the nude female is beautiful and nothing ashamed of him). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to share with a poorly-made doll star named George. Now this has become embarrassing! <br /> <br /> The world of bioelectronics, invented by the brilliant scientist Edward Brack (Wellington Mevert), George (who looks like a clown with green wool for poetry) is artificial intelligence. The front of an advanced computer system uses a revolutionary device (a silver ball the size of a golf ball) which, when taken, can reverse personality disorders. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality alterations have been successful in the laboratory animals, but the cautious world hesitates in testing humans, fearing that there may still be side effects. However, his evil help Julie (Debbie Laster), does not have such difficulties, and continues to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, all of them are turning into deadly and hideous mutations. <br /> <br /> With special effects in the basement, a few completely devoid of talent, the plot is almost impossible to follow (I noticed notes while watching the movie, even so, I'm not quite convinced that my feed is accurate), Nightmare Weekend A complete and decisive disaster can not even save many soft sex scenes and a touch of injustice. <br /> <br /> This movie also features one of the most outrageous characters I have ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), an idiot walkman who escapes music to the 1980s in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison .
