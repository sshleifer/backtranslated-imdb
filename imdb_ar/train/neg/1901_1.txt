This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The classic 1974 classic Gone begins in 60 seconds. In fact he behaved well and the plot moved well. But even Hollywood's big budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original scheme was thieves working insurance inspectors. Whoever doubts them. But even with the change in every aspect of H.B. Halicki original, the new version is a very good film, until we get to the scene of the final chase, which is part of version 74 which made it wonderful. The water in this version is diluted, only 10 minutes away, and crowned by a special monster effect that takes every endorsement of the chase. When the original chase was very reasonable, the star was a skilled driver who did all his tricks, and the new version fell within 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase movie, fine the original in the bargain box with your local renters and keep up to date on the new version.
