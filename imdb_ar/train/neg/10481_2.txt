The film was badly filmed, with the exception of some of the old names known in Hollywood. Other offers with unknown names (ie, Jennifer Gabriel) are not inspiring. I have watched other films for this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst films. Maybe this is a reflection scenario? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, the performance of Kim Basinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. I enjoyed Pat more in karate kidd, though. There are many good films to watch, in short, this film is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanes
