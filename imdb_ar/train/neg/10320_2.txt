I really hope this is a funny show, given all the noise and smart preview clips. Speaking of hype, I even heard an interview with the show builder on the BBC World Today - a program broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this offer is not approaching submission. All jokes are clear - the kind that sounds funny the first time you hear but then looks lame - and have not been given any treatment or new development. All characters are one-dimensional. Representation - Good - Average (I'm cute). It's the classic CBC recipe - the one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you should be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you are white you are likely to be slightly insulted by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed as either fanatical or ignorant or both of them. Not that the irony of white people is a problem - most of the best comedies have roots in it. It's just a problem when it's not funny - as in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada explodes with funny people - so many that we regularly export them to Hollywood. How did the producers of this offer find nothing?
