Do not waste your time, let alone pay the rent of this piece of cable car! How I got it is further than me. (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I have already summarized this abandoned film, but, well ...) The acting was terrible, they all needed lessons. The plot was weak ... End! I think cinematography was the only thing that did not quite absorb it ... well, maybe the sound was ok. The good thing is that if they can produce this movie, or even make some money with it, there may be hope for any screenwriter who has a real idea. So, everything takes the heart! I think the same thing applies to representatives ... If these people have already earned money, you can!
