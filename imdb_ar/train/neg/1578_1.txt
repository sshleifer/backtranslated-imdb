Imagine, for example, 12-1 am - in your home, bored, not tired. This scenario happened about, say 4 years or so .. I turned on the TV and turned on some channels and found that this movie was running. My words this is the worst film I have ever seen! A luxury car can not be stopped (because the brakes have been cut or something) in the beating on the highway - what will happen? This movie was very bad and I think that in fact the cost of the stunts was about $ 2, there was one case where a baby / toddler was leaving the car by helicopter - trying to excite the viewer - a convenient position approaching the bridge from the front ... this is The best part of a film ever - it shows that the child misses the bridge by a narrow margin but it looks so bad - you can almost see the shape of the doll they used - a classic low-budget total! I can not remember the end of the film, but I bet it was great. <br /> <br /> I doubt they will be playing this movie again so I'm glad I saw this piece of trash!
