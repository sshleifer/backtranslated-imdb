I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was nothing more than a very exciting show, where Act I was the killing, according to Quinn Martin's presentation, Act II was the main character in the discovery of the murder, the plot twisting (the murder of another character) Is the decision and the conclusion was Betty (Lee Mroyer) asking her father Barnaby Jones (Paddy Ibsen) about how he discovered the crime, and then someone says something brilliant at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> The only thing I remember was the wonderful song and great composer of the composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to watch and stop the show throughout the seven seasons that were on air. I will also admit that it was good to see Ibsen in the role of not good Clambet despite the poor Ibsen badly. I wish the show was more enjoyable than I remembered for the first time. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through the US TV Archive Channel. Let's just say that I was more than Goldsmith about the program "Barnaby Jones".
