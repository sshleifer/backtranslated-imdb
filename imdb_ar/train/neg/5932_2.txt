What kind of documentary about the musician who failed to include one song for the same artist?! Unlike "Ray" or countless films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) brings back the same wonderful songs. Here, all tracks are covers with interesting figures, and these renditions fail to capture Cohen's slow pace and jazz. Often, the covers are very bad sung versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are more or more with musicians and other characters rather than Cohen himself. The film rarely shows Cohen reading his own works (never sings) - such as letters, poems, etc. The film did not capture much about the artist's life story or its development over the years. Great disappointment for Cohen's great lovers.
