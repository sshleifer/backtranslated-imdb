God, I was bored by my head and I saw this pilot. I was expecting a lot of him, and I'm a big fan of James Cameron (not just since "Titanic", he added) and his name in credits that I thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again, as Feed wrote odd days ..). But it failed miserably to attract my attention at any time in about two hours. All the while, I've barely exceeded its two-line summary, and it would be very difficult to try to figure out what kind of coherent charts are from all the clutter that has not reached anywhere. Moreover, I do not think acrobatics even surpassed any regular "A-Team" episode. For Alba, yes, it's wonderful, of course, but the fact that it only offers one facial expression to the entire film (the frown and emphasis) makes me bored of Chetik's "attitude attitude" very soon. You can statistician of this, Mr. Cameron!
