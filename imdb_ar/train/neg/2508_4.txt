About the time they released the movie on DVD. I know that some say the World Bank is rushing to make this movie because of The Dreamgirls. However, how can you quickly release a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD version of this movie, no special feature, and no 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do much better then this. The sound and image quality in this film needs some serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems that WB has not put much time and attention into this movie because it is a black film and I have good sales. They could have kept the CD that does not contain all the songs on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes because it is a classic movie. But WB need to go add some more special feature. Make notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation, where you may only see performance, and the sound in both is much better, much, than this DVD.
