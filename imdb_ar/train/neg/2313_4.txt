Shintar√¥ Katsu has gained a lot of fame as he plays a brilliant personality, Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unreasonable concept - the blind man is Japan's greatest swordsman and every film is spent correcting mistakes and severe restrictions on evil actors. He's a heck for a nice guy and thrilling and addictive movies (I've already seen every movie). Because of this I saw this last installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, which I assumed would be very similar .... The boy was wrong! It turns out that the films of Hanso are of a very sexual nature and also encourage the rape of "women who deserve it." As you can see, Hanso is a policeman from the Meiji period. He regularly takes the evil women into custody and interrogates them by raping them with a "steel rod". How to make a member very strong is something you should believe, but it is certainly not hypersensitive. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend anyone to watch these violent and wrong films for women. However, from looking at other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and this is very scary. Despite some spectacular and amazing scenes of fighting, the films are like brain pollution - and I hate to imagine how films have contributed to violence against women.
