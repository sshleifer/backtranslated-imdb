* May contain a spoiler of some kind? * Just mention Crispin Glover enough to send some Geek panties in a bunch. His historical appearance in "Return to the Future", where George McFly has been closed in the American conscience forever. Recently, he was trying to return to the acrid subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, Crispin filmed a cheap 76 minute Dada. Sometimes it reminded me of genius, while it was almost an insult to me, but not because of its content. Includes? What is that? Is a film, in half the film, all actors suffer from Down syndrome, giving him a sense of astonishment. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey, and a young man with cerebral palsy. All this had a sense of what John Waters was trying to do with miserable life, feeling at the same time more successful and arbitrary failure. <br /> <br /> Half of Down's syndrome representatives also include several snails that have been killed. It's about a person with snails, and ends up killing one. He is also tortured by a handful of other people, grasshopper. He falls in love with two girls, one of whom fucks him in a graveyard. He also has a disagreement with a friend who bothers him. <br /> <br /> In a quirky sub-set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. It's something like controlling a man's mind, and a man's cerebral palsy is something like a sex. Well, at least he gets masturbation in clear scenes. There are other "horrific" images of humor, such as the intersection of the Nazi Suaztikas with the Temple of Shirley, and the black-faced miners saying they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the torturer still deals with his love of killing snails and beating others. They hit him with rocks, as well. Later, they beat the vocalist after his trial. <br /> <br /> Back inside, Crispin Glover is still regent of his group, trying to control everyone, but he fails miserably. <br /> What is this? Less logical than Dr. Caligari, he has more than a transient style stolen from him. The mind-boggling space is very much like the way Dr. Caligari's groups felt. They also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense. Everything ended with absurd images for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in about 20 minutes of the film ... maybe a little more ... what's this? Running out of pictures. In the next 56 minutes, we kept running the same image sets, and only presented new images in the form of a silly puppet show. The film seems more than just a film trying to push the envelope in offensive images and taboos. He tries to ridicule and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it only contains enough pictures for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, cinema and design and everything else was very cheap and almost unplanned. It looked like, "Well, that's how we can do it and get it out of the way." I was not interested and was very boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had a wonderful cinematic industry and framing. The difference between the two is very stunning. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
