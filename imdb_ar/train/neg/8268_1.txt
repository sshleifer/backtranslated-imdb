This movie is horrible I've had it all before. There is nothing original. I can not stand when the book does not reach their own plots. <br /> <br /> A girl hangs up on her thirteenth birthday and wakes up as an adult. They, much like a movie in the 1980s called Big. The most disturbing thing is the representation of Jennifer Garner. She does not act as if she were 13 years old, she acts as if she is stupid. <br /> <br /> From then on, you can guess the entire plot. She gets a good job and happens to be a 13-year-old friend. Wow, how wonderful it is! But, no .... her bad friend turns to her, trying to get her job. But, of course, she finally won when she came up with the idea of ​​"wonderful." <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie that I saw a thousand times ago. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
