It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, and it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008, and it has now happened with another classic of the Wargames game of the 1980s ... :( Why, oh, why, why not learn Hollywood? You can not reshape ...! Suck .... we all hate them ....! <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen the original version of 1983 with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, To rent / buy it now .... The machine may seem old, and the special effects are not in the new millennium, but they still outperform this garbage .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived during the 1980s When piracy was exciting, Ka Well, we now have the wisdom to avoid this film as a nuclear thermal war! <br /> <br /> Never before has the "great chess game" seemed the best option ....
