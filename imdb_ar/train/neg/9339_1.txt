I thought they should have called this film the name "eggs" instead of "heights". A kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are really obsessed and think their lives are very important ... Give me a break. Such as this white-tulip film that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in, this film screamed for a real person to come and steal it ... so they present, get this, a whiter figure than the rest of the cast (I thought it was Albino at the beginning) It's supposed to be Welsh! I'm still trying to break this accent! Dishonestly honest ... This film is a kind of film that can fool a lot of people into thinking it is worthwhile because it contains something more ambitious decorations. It is better to fill the theaters with the MI5-10 instead of these buzzing crap ... It should be a better play because you can not fall on the floor.
