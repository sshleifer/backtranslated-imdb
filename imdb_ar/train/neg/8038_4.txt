** SPOILERS ** Reproduces a meaningless slant film with a killer running in a black robe and wearing what looks like a rubber mask Peter Laurie. Early in the film, the first scene, she was told that Little Morgan was on high alert for drug abuse after her boyfriend was killed in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Connawi), obsessed with arresting the killer, also killed his daughter in Tennyson at about the same time. At the time when the film "Want to Know Secret" ended, did not the relationship between these two operations in Connecticut be described by the slaughter in Florida for about half a dozen collage students after one year? Some that the killer, at least in the killing of her boyfriend Beth, wore the same ridiculous Halloween costume. <br /> <br /> In the Spring Holiday in Sunshine, the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before they know they are starting to stop smoking at one time. From computer geek, Brad Clayton, Chad Allen, the killings have spread to the city with a number of people who have nothing to do with the target student, including police chief Gavin and Jack McGee, who have opened up to segments. <br /> <br /> The masked killer saves one house for another in this strange celebration in an abandoned church, in what resembles Florida Everglades. Then finally reveals who he is and what he intends to have as much meaning as the film does, nothing. An attempt to intimidate his audience, whatever the film does, confuses him with a number of unconvincing scenes. The most effective that faced the victim of Washington Oz, Tom Jay Jones, survived at least three attempts in his life and ended up with the client Sacher, the hero in the film. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a nasty break from a large piece of glass that nearly split him into two halves and his shell, but he miraculously recovered after being arrested for murder he did not commit. Two more times and not with a slight lurch in his walk! Nor did it make any sense at all to go to Oz and Beit on their own to catch the murderer and arrest him instead of calling the police, using a cell phone owned by Oz, instead? <br /> <br /> Pitt's friend, who lost his head in Hank Ford's film, Joseph Lawrence, is also unconvinced, as are the two girls at the beach house. As the victims of the killers then disappear somehow from the horizon! For a moment they did not know whether they had really been killed at all or whether this was a kind of hallucination for Oz or the local police. Until the last scene outside the wall where they set out in the church. <br /> <br /> As we take a closer look at a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, they are drunk and act abhorrent, we try to get him. On with Hank as Beth walks unnoticed by Hank and Tina. This seems to be the most annoying house killed by her boyfriend at the beginning of the film!
