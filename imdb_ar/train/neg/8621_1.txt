The previous poster worked clearly on the film. It's a joke how bad it is and no one can review this kind of film the way it did it. The mention of all the names of the actors and what they were before is a sure sign that they are somehow involved. <br /> <br /> It's on Cinemax right now and I'm sure it was a movie where porn stars (so-called Ava as well-known and talented) were forced to do something else for a crazy tax reason. <br /> <br /> Also, when I first saw her, I was sure that she was manufactured in almost 1986 and was born in 73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... in 1993! do not believe! <br /> <br /> Although I will call it one of the very bad films, they are good movies. Such as watching the train wreck.
