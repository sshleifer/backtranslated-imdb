First I loved this movie. It seemed to me a pretty comedy with some ridiculous moments. Albert Walsky made his best fashion designer !!! The same decor exquisite Robert R. Benton - this guy really had a very good taste! But the text book disappointed me too. The best end would be the scene on the ladder, but instead they decided to have the father and daughter together. I do not like the end. The father becomes a friend of his daughter and knows his former wife and finds him well. It would be fine, if a scriptwriter said for example that there is now a different soul in the flesh, but they did not, they have deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Sibyl Shepard was charming, and Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :)) ... but some moments spoil even the impression of good behavior. For example, Corinne Jeffreys, who was played by Sibyl Shepard after her husband's death for 23 years (it's been a long time!), Was sincere to him and was loved only by one. When she met him and was just about making love to him, With her friend Philip Treen (Ryan O'Neill), easily betrayed the man she had longed for !!! It will be a good film, if not the end, and has been missed by human psychology.
