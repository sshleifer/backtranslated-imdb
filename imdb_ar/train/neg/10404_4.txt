This, the Tremors' live video rattle, has 60 seconds inspired (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more filling and stuffing than you can get rid of. It is clear that the 4 tremors were launched on a low budget in a disabled manner. This means that they had enough special Mojo effects for three or four minutes of venomous violence on precious human, tops. The weak, vulgar and clerical writing ensures that the remaining one-and-a-half hours of Tremors 4 is at least fifteen thousand years old. Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to sit down, less enjoy this movie. If you are not among them - do not bother.
