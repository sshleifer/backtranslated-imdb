This was another great screen-saver for a US television show of the 1960s. Mars descends on Earth and meets humans who do not begin to see them. <br /> <br /> The usual strangeness is intertwined with man, the bridges, which finally connect with him and help him to return home. Along the way, the girl also gets, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice stroll to some of the cool Hollywood stars I have not seen in a while. <br /> <br /> It's fun enough to pass some free time if you do not have something better to display.
