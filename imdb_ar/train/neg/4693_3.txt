This is exactly the kind of film that frustrates me most. Wonderful crew, great director, great story potential, then spoil it all through a scenario that does not go anywhere ... and they say nothing while going there! There is no depth here at all. No depth of characters, no depth of the plot, no depth of surprise, suspense, or common sense. We know what's going on, we were told how they plan to fix the problem, fix the problem, and throw a surprise at us near the end that failed to generate any suspense, then finish the movie suddenly. A wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Glen Ford is leading a group of British and French actors who are all brilliant and perform an incredibly impressive work with their one-dimensional writing. One of my favorite favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", who offers some wonderful shots of humor and warmth for a dark and serious film. I also thought that the film had a wonderful look on it ... all the shadows and fog ... it seems that the movie Noir feels. <br /> <br /> Although the actors are doing their best and the output can be fun, it's still not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. Glenn Ford movies are much better: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
