This movie was terrible. I've seen it three times, not even everything. Impossible to watch, suck the story series, it's frustrating, and absolutely disgusting. I do not write vandals about anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, check it out yourself. The only good thing about this film is John Savage, his dialogue at first, and some funny parts of the film. The little boy in this annoying film, the situation is all nonsense. I saw this movie in film stores all over America, so I assumed it would be a good film. Jesus Christ, have you been wrong! Representation is terrible, nudity itself is lame and bad. Another thing is that Star Andreev, the other main character, was not in bad movies in the past, but was in some good movies. Same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
