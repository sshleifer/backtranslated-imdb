I can not believe that the Indian film industry still puts such a third degree as Waqt. For starters, the story is not reasonable at all? The spoiled son is expelled from the family home to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He quickly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some hops in front of the stars before a panel of judges (honestly I'm not kidding here). In the meantime, his father dies of lung cancer, but he keeps it secret from the son, but he remains long enough to see his son famous, and sees his new grandson and make a giraffe a new game with his hands. <br /> <br /> Acting is swinging and worth idle? No effort was made to try to act in any convincing way by any of the key players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge palace and seemed relatively influenced by real world concerns. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers when producing such horrible films are clever viewers who made a mistake in seeing such a movie. Actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be respected as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
