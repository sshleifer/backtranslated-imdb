I have no idea of ​​any way out for the audience George Schlatter hopes to sell this comedy. With the role of Redd Foxx in the central role and the presence of a large number of tough clothes and polyester for the carpets of the seventies of the last century, the film "Norman" as a blaxploitation image associated with any number of episodes of comic play playful misunderstanding, not to mention the elongated veil of Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clarke, this story tells a married couple (Foxx and Beryl Bailey) the difficult way of being their own gay son secretly - and lives with a small gay person who hates himself and fucks him - has enough jagged jokes Disgraceful shame of any early episode of the Three Company. Bailey maintains her dignity, and the intense confusion between Foxx is useful for a few chuckles, but the rest of the performers are insulted. * from ****
