Love To Kill (1993) by Billy Chung Seo Hong (Assassin's Deadly Assassin of 1993) is one of the strongest products in the third category boom that hosted Hong Kong cinema in the early 1990s. They were made up of films with strong sex, nudity, violence, and more than justifiable and shocking only appreciated. Love To Kill certainly belongs to the "more" category with some memorable ideas and parts of celluloid disease. <br /> <br /> The HK Psycho Anthony Wong (from the award-winning The Untold Story, by Herman Yau, of the same year) plays a businessman and a couple who loves to torture and rape and rape her young wife (Elizabeth Lee May Fong), for some reason He leaves him and saves herself and her little son from the troubled tormentor. (Danny Lee, the famous actor in the police from films such as Dr. Lamb (1992) to Billy Tang (co-directed by Lee) and The Killer (1989) to John Woo to name a few) sees the problem and starts protecting the wife and son, but Anthony does not favor This all at all leads to the typical end of the spirit and spirit during a rainstorm. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost entirely without any serious advantages because it is just a piece of exploitation to take advantage of when this genre of movies is very popular. Pictures and events are nothing at all in Western cinema, at least in the mainstream, and everything becomes more sensational when some / most taboos of Westerners, such as violence and perversion of the child, are broken into these films so often reading the charts alone To make most viewers feel sick, and this applies especially to this film as well. <br /> <br /> The film still contains an interesting and creepy track in Dr. Lamb's tradition. Which practically began a complete boom in 1992. Normally the music and sound in Hong Kong films adds an interesting image, especially in these terrorist films. It is worth mentioning that cinematography is worth mentioning while bathing the film, especially in the end, in blue colors and camera lenses (as does Assassin also), and the storm is captured well on the camera. Otherwise there would be nothing that would evaluate the film most on a narrow scale. <br /> <br /> The actors and actors are talented and professional, so do not make the film worse with their acting. The film still has its usual humor in Hong Kong, which makes sick events more satisfactory, with some "humor" thrown into the soup. This includes some jokes about the erection of Danny Lee and so on .. something that can not be found in Western movies "Avenue" too. This thing usually destroys Hong Kong films that are otherwise referred to, since humor is only a very obvious way of trying to entertain the public and the masses. <br /> <br /> The movie has a very terrible level because it contains many scenes depicting Wong's mistreatment in different ways. She is raped, harassed, beaten and kicked by her husband. We also got some memories of Wong's equally violent childhood, where his father and his young son were also killed. These flashback scenes, which often appear at the end of the film, also include some unexpected experiences where images are accelerated (for example, ax strokes) that create a crazy atmosphere and mean a vibrant atmosphere of the scene. Again, it seems that Hong Kong's exploiters are only able to come out. The end itself contains a lot of sudden and amazing nonsense, while the crazy man with his ax and also meets some nails, for example, in his angry way. <br /> <br /> The film is also "suspicious" in my opinion as violence and terrorism are realistically realistic and deal with things that should never be taken as entertainment, I mean rape. The version I saw (I've seen two copies) includes a very long and furious rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible. I'm not sure Hong Kong fans really like these pictures, but I think nobody has a sense of morality in movies / entertainment that he will never accept or do anything like. Women are brutally beaten and killed in the most sadistic and low way so that the fate of men becomes close when compared to females. <br /> <br /> The other version I saw, a newly released Hong Kong DVD (without subtitles), has the scene of "table brutality" in a much longer format than the Taiwanese-translated DVD, which is similar to the Hong Kong version. I have also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different from these two, and since the final credits are full of scenes and images that are not in the actual film, it is impossible to say how those versions were released or shown as "uncut". The play is. It is clear that many of the footage has been cut, even before the theatrical release. <br /> <br /> The movie is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin, who has also written films such as Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story and Militants (Kirk Wong, 1988) But among his other films I've seen, Love to Kill is the most satisfying. Dr. Lamb and a storyless story are both very wild and violent, but they also try to criticize the authorities and men in general, where it is easy to turn into a monster when chasing someone or fighting him. The horrific torture pictures of Untold's story, the victim being a criminal, are extremely powerful and have certainly had an effect on changing something that may be corrupt in society and among police for example. But there is none of this in Love to Kill, it's just an honest, calculated and quick exploitation, which, incidentally, was produced by veteran director Kirk "Organized Crime & Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)" Wong! <br /> <br /> "Love to Kill" does not earn more than 2/10 of me because I do not highly appreciate films like this. (HK) is supposed to be a movie, and can be more, and movies like Love to Kill are just commercial parasites living among real art pieces.
