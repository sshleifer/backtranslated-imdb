This is actually an insult to the victims and their families from the BTK killer. The events in this film are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a film of real events is meaningless because real events are more interesting then this farce. Do not waste your time watching this for free. A low budget and a depressing portrayal of events that should not be a joke, this is what this film really did. If they let me give it to this movie I would like to. The acting sucks seem to have been filmed on an older VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
