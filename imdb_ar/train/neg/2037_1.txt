If I could give it zero, I would change my mind and give it 10 instead. The film is absolutely terrible with no film plot, no sense of what is happening. Just boring. Please do not waste your money on this one. Pleaseee !!! It would have been a good film if it really portrayed the story of the real zodiac killer, but I did not feel anything but disgust while watching it. Prefer yourself and rent some classic movies instead, it's best to watch a movie you've seen already like 3 to 4 times more than watch these craps! I do not understand why people even bother making such films when they know they will not work. The killer must be called "Boriac killer" instead !!!
