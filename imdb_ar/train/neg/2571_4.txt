With Goldie Hoon and Peter Sellers in the film You Personally, this film will not make a mistake. But what can I say? This was a terrible imbalance. The film revolves around Peter Sellers as an older man suddenly finding himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention the attractive hippie in Goldie Hoon. The film is incredibly broken and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Julie Hone are very funny people, but this film does not prove that. <br /> <br /> This song about Crabrella Arabella is fantastic, but that's all. I only recommend this movie to people who want to watch a very innovative film, that is almost one definition. I think that this film more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it being demonstrably obvious and everywhere about disrespect, the problem is that quality has been fully photographed and written, not to mention that the trend is just there. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers in particular is harmful and absent, and will move from Dr. Strangelove and Kung there throughout his career, to stupid films like this and Christian Christ, which was very similar to this film in context and style, but this film was not He has funny moments. This one does not make sense, and I am sad because a wonderful person like Peter Sellers was in this film. Not recommended for anyone.
