Well, I'll lie if you say this can easily rival Spiderman or Batman movies. However, it was more appealing to me because it is a moral value. I first bought a VHS device when my son was about two years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I strongly support Robert Townsend, and since he used credit cards to finance his first film, Hollywood Shuffle. True, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make films more credible, but his films are still enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The Meteor Man offers a modern urban character. I have always felt that if there are supernatural heroes, they will not present the same scenarios as shown in the storyboards. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: broken cars, bad neighborhoods, local drug gangs that use children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission within the community has remained largely unchanged. <br /> <br /> What I found to be really interesting, beyond the performance of James Earl Jones, "The Forever Young," was how the neighborhood responded to its newly discovered powers. It was not long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his inputs, of course. It was funny to hear them lend to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the film was expected, there was misbehavior and continued continuity, but it ranked number 1 with my children. Robert Townsend is working to bring the films back home, so to speak. I doubt that he will really recognize that he is the talented actor / producer / director who really is, but there and will always be, those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> There is a point to think about the movie I find amusing: Throughout the battle with Simon, no one bothered to contact the police ???? Also, what mother and father you know will watch their son fight out of a window? My mother was there, scrapped by my side, from the soles of my feet to my soles. Dad will have to load his gun. Lol <br /> <br /> You can rent it and check it. You should see at least once and good for those of you who are Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc.
