The label, called "No Plot and No Meaning", literally took the words that I would use in an objective line. The only thing I would like to add is "passionate". For a film made from a real married couple that includes lots of graphic sex scenes, this film can make what should be an ugly situation in a situation that goes beyond colds. Dafoe and Colagrande seem bored during sex scenes, and the Valium viewer may also take and have done. Also, please, women from the WAY audience saw a large number of cotton caps used in their time, and anyone who is operated by seeing Willem Dafoe pull a blood clot from his wife's vagina really needs treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where the waiter explains to Dafoe always sleepy what is "jambalaya dissolved". (All the ingredients of the dish are still separated from each other rather than boiled together). This film is "Removable Film". All the elements are there: a nervous house, isolated, a dead husband, a creepy player on the score, an eccentric guard who comes and goes as he pleases, deaths of car accidents and near death, figures with a secret history. Basically all the exciting cliches you can think of, but nothing comes together. Everything sits there only and never merges into a coherent piece of land or even a piece of artistic temperament. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes on "jambalaya deconstructed". Potential tenants will have this mess well to leave this disassembled movie on the RV video store.
