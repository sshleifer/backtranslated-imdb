This series is one of the worst performances I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, and you get my drift. The stories are very far from the legend of Robin Hood. They seem to have just wanted to use the Robin Hood name to attract the audience. He may also be called the new adventures of Mr. Bland acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented before me that if you have a fantasy, you like this show. This is a terrible approach to the TV series. Visual media like this must raise your imagination, and you should not have to force your imagination to something that makes it good. It would be like a Simpson family ring where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film and start talking about who was killed or who was. "If the film is boring, I'm making my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: absolute human waste.
