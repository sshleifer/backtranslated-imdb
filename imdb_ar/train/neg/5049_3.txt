A group of us watched this film with disgust. We were willing to tolerate the fact that our favorite character Joe was not working (it's not as if writers / producers can do anything about it). The writing was bad, and the script was substandard. What really bothered us: 1. When the two men realized that they were going back to Natalie, all they had to do was confront this stupid (and ultimately humiliating) - but only because they were muscular rivals, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Although unable to choose between the two men before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decided that she already loved one of the men and is now ready to marry him? (And there was no prediction that he was a really better person, it was as if the book turned on a coin and then spat it out in time for the film). 3. Blair refers to talking about how she does not want children and then suddenly when her husband says he wants to have children, she agrees with him happily.
