I have seen this film for years in a collective tradition of Fast Forward Film festivals, where we started renting a bunch of B movies and voting on who chose the worst thing. <br /> <br /> The night we saw it, it was voted the best, because of what it looks like to plan for fashion and enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a silly and silly film, seen in full understanding that you're watching a low-budget flick. However, I do not personally recommend additional material ... this film will leave your own imprint. <br /> <br /> It made me feel a lot of the impression that I was actually trying to get a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice if you plan to watch bad movies. This is fun, I remember bouncy music ...
