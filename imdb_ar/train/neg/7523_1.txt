Once again I seized the opportunity and rented this garbage bag. It was described as a horror flick, and there was not a single scene, nor a single scene, it was so scary remotely. Not one !! Sure, there was some nudity, but all the homosexual actions became a bit old. I think maybe it was supposed to be the grace of saving this film? Dan, what an annoying ass bag! From the beginning, I knew I was in it when Dan first spoke good. Was it supposed to be intimidating? What a laugh !! All in all, this movie is horribly awful! How in hell do movies like this get made? If you want a movie with a few excerpts, do not rent this movie. This movie is about as exciting as Teletubbies.
