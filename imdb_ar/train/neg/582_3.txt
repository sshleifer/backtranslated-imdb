A wonderful book with wonderful descriptions and insights into human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which still resonates strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the film ... er. nothing special. It is clear that the photographer had an unfortunate addiction to rotation, rotation and closure around everything, which made the viewer completely nauseous. The reason the director did not stop is something that goes beyond me - but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to get good offers from these excellent but usually inappropriate actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. It is best to spend three hours reading (or re-reading) the book.
