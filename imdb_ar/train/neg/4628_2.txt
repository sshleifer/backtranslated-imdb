Mysty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's all about this movie. The flick is pure exploitation. I began to play a game with myself, and counted the number of times they surrounded the music of the orchestra. Of course, music has nothing to do with the scenes. Example: The walk was recorded incidentally to the room and saying "Hello" with a chase music from a Roman epic. I would like to know why this movie sat on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this film: low-rise women's panties existed in 1954. I talk about Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes take off Misty leisurely and wear her clothes (except lingerie and bras, unfortunately). Also includes terrible dubbing, leading to "Watch out! Godzirra!" Effect.
