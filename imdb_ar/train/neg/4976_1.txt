I saw the grindel the other night and had to put up a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grindel is another version of Beowulf, the epic Anglo-Saxon poem that dates back a thousand years. SciFi has a growing catalog of unprofessional and uninteresting films. The previews promised an unrealistic mini-epic with a low budget, but this channel refused to allow me to switch channels. It was amazing, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched with fascination and horror in the wreckage of the train that can not tear your eyes. I got to Notepad and was able to capture a part of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or may save your mind only. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Just to get it, the Beewulf fighters wore horny helmets. A trivial issue compared to what came after. The helmets also appeared to have been in a box and handed over to a representative walking the next time. Appearance and fitness seem irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - It is clear that Sirte's moorings were extorted in the film by Ringing Brothers, Barnum and Billy. She managed to avoid her red rubber nose, but the clowns did the rest of her makeup. <br /> <br /> Ben Cross pretended not to be ashamed of him as king. His character, Hurtagar, must have become the property of the Danes only minutes before the opening of the film and he had no chance of changing the size of the crown to suit him yet. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate the return of actors to the daily waiting schedules, they were not asked to change their casts at all. A variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz and mullet pieces, and at least worked to divert attention from the dialogue. To prove that it was a multinational team, everyone was encouraged to retain whatever language they chose. <br /> <br /> - As usual in this type of film (at least since Mad Max), the leather shield was a requirement. In this case, the shape was strange, inappropriate and new. <br /> <br /> - Ingrid, who was fond of the female, played by Alexis Peters, was female-loving, following an ancient tradition of rioters who should be seen with a very low volume. <br /> <br /> - The unintended focus of the film was a composite interlaced arc with bursting screws. There was no need to be loaded until it was recoil when launched. You have succeeded in tearing apart the laws of physics, the integrity of the original myth, historical truth and suspense, all on its own. <br /> <br /> - The Harrogar Palace, and Horot, rather than a long gull hall, was apparently designed and built by artisans who drowned with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived in the homeland of the Danes in a ship with two versions of the mast that was originally part of a group, the other two are Santa Maria and the Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Unferth noted the approach of the Beowulf vessel using a telescope. Before you can recover from this amazing innovation, you'll see the ship from his point of view. From the corner, the prince was in a plane of some sort. <br /> <br /> - Interesting reality 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as in the fireplace) fires without heat. This explains why you can see the breath of actors both at home and abroad. <br /> <br /> - Interesting Reality 2: Dance in the Dark Age of Denmark seems like a slow dance I went to in eighth grade. <br /> <br /> - Interesting truth 3: You too, you can make an exploding aerial explosive. But, do not expect to actually hurt anything. By the way, Beowulf was apparently a war veteran in World War II, shouting "Inward!" To interrupt any remaining comments of disbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was very upset and was always in a mess because as a CGI he completely could not leave footprints. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> Amy Grindel ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and her children did not inherit her wings. Retinal genes, I suppose. By the way, we can now guess our guess that Bob Grindel might have been Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and her mother chose to kill randomly, fly away or pull their prey based on close reading in the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> An interesting medical fact: exposure to the legendary monster hard enough to throw fifty feet on the stone causes minor scratches in the face does not bleed a lot. <br /> <br /> - The sword of myth Beowulf used to send the raven as long as he was tall and would contain enough steel to put the second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the oscillator dissipated any concerns about its weight. <br /> <br /> - The best line in the film: Prince Unverth had been flamed by Haag and spat a quarter of the blood nearly six feet. Princess Ingrid was filled with kindness and said, "You're fine, Amir." Lots for this post at the screening clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
