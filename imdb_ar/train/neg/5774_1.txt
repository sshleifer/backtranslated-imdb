This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of more than this film. Get the bus while it seems to be anti-racist, do nothing but scold the eggs and reduce the black status quo. The film revolves around a group of black men traveling on a bus to the march of Louis Farrakhan. On the bus are all sorts of people you can imagine: homosexuals, Muslims, riot bands and Uncle Tom (being thrown out of the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being racist when he arrived at the bus to drive the car. Despite being Jewish and the fact that he made it clear that he ended up being racist and leaving the bus. I hate to say it, but such films need to realize their hipocracy and stereotyping patterns. This should not be considered a victory but a sad disappointment. You might think I'm racist to write this but I mean well. Good luck next time Spike.
