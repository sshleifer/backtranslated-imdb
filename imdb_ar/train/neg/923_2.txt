For some reason, many young couples who walked in the Italian Alps were divided to see who could reach the camp site first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an old demonic wrestler and becomes king of the spirit of "Tiranos" when wearing a helmet belonging to the body. He then spends the rest of the movie running through the forest chasing his friends and breaking his limbs to add some soup to bring Demonicus back to life. The launch of Full Moon is a stupid shot, meaningless, with a terrible voice and sound and Los Angeles National Forest is a bad alternative to Italy. However, they are too high on an unintended laugh scale, thanks to excessive lead performance. Whether running in an insect in a cheap-looking armor waving the sword or scattering a Latin nerve jar around demons and resurrection, Kenny's silly expressions in the face and critical line delivery must be seen. Well, at least not as boring as the rest of the team.
