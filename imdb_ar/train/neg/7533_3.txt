The film had some lovely aspects. Maybe a lot for my taste. I felt as if the writer / director was trying desperately to make us feel the inner conflict of all his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is a TV function, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The train station site was well chosen and enjoyed the performance of Sasha HÃ¶rler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt as if Justine Clarke's performance was extensive. I felt her reaction to things she felt compelled, as if the director were trying to express the themes of the film through the expressions of her hero. As I can not believe that the director could make a wonderful varinacci daniella to an incredible attendance. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the selection of pop music that was applauded through whole strings. This is a lazy device, especially when pop music does not come from anywhere with diabetes to the movie and / or where the lyrics of the song are seriously embarrassing. <br /> <br /> However, there is great quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and the local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sunlight. Especially with the use of brilliant animation sequences that save the film from its total inferiority, and engulf it with passion and charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to see why the dialogue is overworked. "Who knows if there is a god like a person sitting there in heaven telling us what to do" or whatever line. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments is that a friend returns home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to announce to his wife, "I'm giving up smoking." <br /> <br /> Anti-Smoking Declaration? Tac ad with some delicious animation? I had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark - it was all too much.
