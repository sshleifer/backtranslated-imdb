The fourth "tremors" feature in time, dating back to 1889. "Legend begins" in the small "perfect" city, which was then "Rejection, Nevada." When the story begins, seventeen workers are killed by the dreaded "Gravid". Some of the characters in the current "tremors" have legendary and professional ancestors in the past. The most obvious is Michael Gross who returns forever (as Hiram Gomer). Unlike his descendants, Mr. Gross is incompetent with firearms; therefore, the gunman Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) is hired to shoot some "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This one takes some getting used to - as it happens in the distant past. It's like western with mini versions of the original movie monster "Graboids". These conspirators "Dirt Dragons" are nowhere near terror as their "shakes" (1990). Thus, in this film, characters spend a lot of time on Earth, which would not have happened in the original film. It was strange that citizens would give up fighting very quickly, when Gross decided to leave the city temporarily. Why so helpless? Why did not Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) rally people immediately to fight without Gross? Disappointing. Shakes 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
