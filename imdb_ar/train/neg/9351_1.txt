This is the second time you've just stopped part of your video / DVD. <br /> <br /> I was willing to give this film the benefit of doubt at first, although it managed to be shallow, cliched, and stupid ... and joy, puzzlement and humility. <br /> <br /> It was like the post-school feature that the strange ninth-grader produced that nobody thinks he understands ... creepy and sad, with the voice narration that only the most deceptive teenager will look at. And some singing, and ... no, really, the suffering of the poor child ... <br /> <br /> Enough, already, especially when turned into a slut, clumsy, and insulting the orange ripoff. Did you mention singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt was less forced to sit in it. I do not recommend it to anyone.
