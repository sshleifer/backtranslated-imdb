After waking up at 3:30 am and not being able to sleep, I decided to be fun while I was deprived of sleep. This movie was on HBO and decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you care): a nervous man with an addiction to candy (Josh Cornblut) acts as a temporary institution for some ridiculous companies. Suddenly, he was given the chance to "go to Perm", which seems to be the favorite phrase in this film. But with a safe job and secure income at hand, Josh decides for any stupid reason that he does not want to do so. It is a desperate desperate many simple tasks, laziness and inadequate ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send so many "very important" messages over a certain period of time is supposed to be a joy, but it's just stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer woman, and ends up in bed together (obviously a fantasy for Josh in real life, because such a thing will never happen). There are a bunch of other things happening, but they are very vulgar and can not be entered now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film was described as a comedy, I laughed twice; it was the first time I shot Josh Cornblott (my first reaction was afraid of fear) and the second when he was The bed with the attractive woman (yes, on the right). Josh Cornbluth was perhaps the most terrifying person I have ever seen. He is an unattractive Jewish man of extra weight, supposed to believe he fucked with beautiful women. I never sympathize with Josh. He is lazy and unenthusiastic and I do not appreciate the attempts at the failed humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
