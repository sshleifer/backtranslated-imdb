Do not get me - I love David Sochitt as a Poirot. I love serial as well as movies but already enough re: death on the Nile. Everyone has done this one! We know who died. We know why they die. We know who is the killer. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Sochitt could have used that wonderful talent in one of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the act by all the actors was wonderful. The collections were fantastic and very realistic. I especially liked David Sol but I was surprised at how "awful" it was. I hope that does not look this way in the "real" life! Frankly I can not remember from other films whether the ending is the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought it was a fairly wonderful touch whether Mrs. Christie or not wrote this way. Better to end this and then waste the prison!
