No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for most low-rent horror films, especially those called Roger Ebert's "Dead Teenager Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 is certainly qualified as Dead Teenager, only here, the teenagers were given the physical appearance of military trainees. <br /> <br /> Some will argue the line "It's just a movie" when dubious facts are raised in a film review, but I've always believed that good imagination must be rooted in reality to be effective. In The Hills Have Eyes 2, we believe that the main characters are military personnel in a training exercise, but they look and speak like high school children camping in the desert. The dialogue is terrible and often vulgar. Although the films are almost indistinguishable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" were in Platon, intimidated with dismay. <br /> <br /> Very few characters invoke a soldier other than guns and exhaustion: radio broadcasts are carried out like teen phone conversations. Colonel is the titles "hey, fool" by the private. No one seems to have a clue what to do, or any sense of leadership structure, when things start to go wrong. I think of the soldiers in the foreign film James Cameron, a fictional film, and how these future Marines acted as real soldiers despite their wonderful positions. Imagination is actually rooted. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to start watching a 5-by-10 movie, and look at the strengths and weaknesses from there. You have to allow concessions of materials; there is no way because Star Wars is as good as Godfather's film, equally. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this regard, while Hills Have Eyes 2 is a very scary exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is rather mildly worse in this regard than Dead Dead's typical film. On the technical side, the film seems to have appropriate production values ​​and is well made from this perspective. The sights that aim to shock or are intended to raise the urgency or excitement in general. So, while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may already be a worse fate than death, there is certainly much worse horror in the circulation. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching for those who enjoy this kind of stuff without the usual usual luggage, or those who do not tend to think about every movie they see is either the best at all or the worst at all. If you do not get "horror", especially "Dead Deadager", it is unlikely to have fun with this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
