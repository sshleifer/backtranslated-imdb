(Some potential spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to drop $ 80 million on this very tired animation. Perhaps they thought that the amazing animation would be more than enough to attract audiences (mostly families) to see it in large numbers. Well, he seems to have been successful on the weekend, earning nearly $ 26 million and earning $ 38.1 million. Total (estimate for this week). But I think the crowds that came over the weekend saw the same thing that I saw when I saw and spread the word. It's a very lame film, apart from everything else about animation, it seems the script is mostly performed by a three-year-old. <br /> <br /> The movie is only about 80 minutes away. Long, but it looks like an epic three hours. Some of the sticking points for me are, well, the annoying narration is one of them, obviously written. At some point, some of the hijackers escape, and although you can see the horse clearly afraid, the narrator (Matt Maton's talented voice) emerges to illustrate any misconceptions (which will only occur in the most basic mindsets). Another problem is the constant popup of Bryan Adams songs, and now I admire his music, I think he's in good shape, but come to it, DreamWorks really thought that the audience would be able to deal with 8-9 of his songs throughout this short film, And here is the spoiler, is shot at the horse from close to one of the members of the skull, not less, they (horse) and Tqq In a river, Spirit tries to save her, but they cross a waterfall of at least 50 feet, and later in the film near the end, we see that the horse is alive and well. Realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a really lame movie, competing, I'm not saying that kids will not enjoy it, but anyone else will only check its hours waiting for the end of this trip. 10 worst list this year. - ** out of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
