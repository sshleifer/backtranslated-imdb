Arthur Asky's great skill was as comedian in the way he communicated with his audience. His jokes fell events, silly songs and dances well fucking because he was able to engage people and draw them into his world outside the wall. The lack of a direct audience was a clear flaw to him, and he was never quite comfortable in films. He has his moments at The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been designed to make the most of his talents, but Askey needs the performer to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in the film is not strong, and includes co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as Linden Traverse's honeymooner going to the top of "Crazy Woman". Also on board was Peter Murray Hill, who married off-screen Felice Calvert, as a leading nominal man, gave a perfectly nice reading of the part, leading Ms. Lin, who turns out to perform just as poorly. The character of actress Kathleen Harrison is allowed to steal the film effortlessly as a parrot-loving romantic woman who crashed on Brandy's Dr. Morland Graham.
