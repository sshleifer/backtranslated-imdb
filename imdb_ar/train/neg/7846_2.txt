You know, I went to see "Hills have 2 eyes" want to admire. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was fairly entertaining. Obviously they had more money to roam than did Wes Craven in special effects the second time. Although I'm still the best original film, the new version was done well, and it was a pleasure to be guilty to me. Blood effects, intense, and great. In short, Vashar is great for any horror lover. <br /> <br /> which leads us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack of one, thin sheet. We are not opening new horizons exactly here. The army has decided to monitor the area, and all these people have lost. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard for investigation. In real Hollywood style, we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever. Jie, I have never seen this hypothesis before. To make a short story long, your mutants kill off one moron soldiers at a time in graphic fashion. Again, the special effects of Nicotero are wonderful, but it does not matter how boring the drawings become, and unpredictable. Frankly it seemed to me that this flick was just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody and sketchy, but I found it predictable, tedious and not scary at all. To me, it would have been good if this film contained one original idea. Craven and his son participated in writing duties. He has shared with many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
