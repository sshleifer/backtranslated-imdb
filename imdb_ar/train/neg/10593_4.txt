The famous Ed 9 classic "Ed 9" from outer space is characterized by an alien called indignation, "stupid ... stupid, stupid!" I would say that the show A in that experience may be this film, a very absurd science fiction film. <br /> <br /> The star of the falling movement Jean-Claude Van Damme returns to a successful role from the original film. Luke, a former world soldier who is now working to make truly good global soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to regain his role in the first two episodes, he was too small to do much more by the time the fourth film appeared in the Universal Soldier series. So, perhaps cursed under his breath along the way, he kicks and whispers and fails within ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You'll find a lot of reckless violence, but I advise you to get a check of your mind at the door when you start watching this thing. Otherwise, you are responsible for forgetting where you left it in time. <br /> <br /> Luke is called to work against more world soldiers after a truly evil computer named Seth (making a HAL like Ghandi) turns all other world soldiers into vicious killers. Of course this is what these things were programmed, but in this case they kill their originators, not the enemy, that's a problem. <br /> <br /> I like the stupid logic of this film. Logic which thinks that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks shy like Michael Jay White to be in this film. The logic that dictates that the Seth Creator is obsessed with the blue-haired e-mail domain that pops up clich√©s more regularly than Faithful Old's steam. The logic of Karate's ambivalence about the climate is characterized by two characters that ride together despite ten separate pieces of broken glass within Three minutes of screen time. <br /> <br /> The film also features a daughter in a dangerous character, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a disguised wrestler in the uniform of the world soldier, and very romantic, I think the writers thought that talking about romance was really a good thing. When this movie ends, it ends. Not a minute after the huge explosion-style final credits are underway. No finale, no where they are now, no final kiss, just burst, hug, finished. Even creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although there is no plan 9, the United States: TR is a silly little trifle for an action film that will be fun at party parties. Fans of Van Dam who enjoy seeing their hero really reach new depths. It can not be seen on a dangerous stomach.
