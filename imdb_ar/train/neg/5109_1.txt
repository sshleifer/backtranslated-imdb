"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling of satisfaction," called "heart warming," and shows that the label "ABC" had time to assemble. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems these families are experiencing. So I'm sorry. But do not you think it's too much for any family to put four widescreen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, a half-full-size pool and cabinets full of expensive designer clothes? Sure, these families have gone through a lot. Sure, they deserve better things than they had before. <br /> <br /> Frankly, however, the things Tai Bingnington and his crew put in these houses are enough to fit the whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really excites me in this show is how Tai and his crew always have a good say about everything small about the family or the family situation. Tell someone with wheelchairs that he is very strong, or "very brave" does not get old after a while. It may seem rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this offer is overpriced. If you want to watch it, go ahead. This comment is just a follow-up to what you're watching.
