There is no artistic value in this film worthy of any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience either. Ironically, one of the awards is for the cinema, but frankly, the camera moves are of concern at the very least. In each frame, you feel like you are getting a "full picture", as if someone were "cutting your eyes" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not bear watching the whole movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers standing in their barracks and one of the soldiers was fighting to drink alcohol. These scenes and many other similar scenes reminded me of Steven Segal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this piece of nonsense.
