This film is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. Not because he criticizes the communist regime but simply because the film is of low quality. I never want to pay money to watch this. I like Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed that such a poor film might come out of China. He seems to be ignoring the audience and it seems that the director has made the film himself. The footage of the person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute is fun and there are plenty of them. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I looked at this movie on the Internet and it seems that people really love this film. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie buffs believe that if the movie is not in English, it is good automatically. I can not see why people are leading. This is not a technical film, it wastes celluloid.
