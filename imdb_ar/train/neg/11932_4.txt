Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend introduced this film because he saw Groner, which he called a very good science fiction film, Nemesis. So, when we saw that, we quickly found ourselves through parts of the BS drama just to get into the sequence of improbable events. Gruner loves kicking, kicking and kicking. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner is a graduate student forced to stay in the neighborhood near the neighborhood where he grew up. He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join a Mexican gang that keeps torturing his family. Instead of joining, Groner tells the boy to answer (against the gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character that kills everyone (or severely disfigures them) and works to rid his group of these gangs. <br /> <br /> The plot was very cheesy and easy to think about. Gruner may not be well known for choosing his script if this movie is something that can be compared to the possible options. This Jewish neighborhood is completely hell and I enjoyed seeing the crew of competing characters pass by as if they had a chance against Groner's character. The music was a regular movement music (such as the amazing piano and timpani, the swelling of the guitars) which were not really as bad as if they were voted. The director really needed to continue working instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for tense family moments. <br /> <br /> In the end, I gave it 4/10 because it really tried to be a motion picture film. Oliver Gruner becomes a star, but the general feeling of the film makes you want to close more to what you just saw.
