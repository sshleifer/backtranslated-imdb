First, this film is very dated, does not focus on his presentation of the leftist political revolution. Frankly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is meaningless, since the answer has been reached through being intellectually specific), it is limiting to despair ; As if we all must return to being monkeys in the name of equality - it is simply ironic. Our mentality is only one of many human qualities, but that does not mean we should not teach ourselves to the highest possible degree. But this non-educational message is undoubtedly related to Goddard's use of rock music; hence Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil," which we are witnessing in its creation and through which the film was taken, is not really something special. The tendon sequence, which is not particularly original, was used to better influence the "Thankyou" Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin II). Apart from that, Sir 'Mick Jagger declares in his usually ambiguous style (instead of Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodic phrase is repeated in an unimaginable way again to form the verse. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that black leopards portrayed in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes include the fascist equation with pornography; a letter that actually undermines sexual "liberation" in the 1960s And today (in fact, a letter that would lie the behavior of "Rolling Stones" soon to produce the film). <br /> <br /> No wonder, the DVD came free with the Sunday Times! For a truly deep historical exposition of leftist sympathies, listen to Luigi Nuno's masterpiece, "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
