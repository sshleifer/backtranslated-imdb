This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if hearing some of the children they were doing without cheese at Cow Dung Collehe, the president would immediately change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, despite the seriousness, the concept of politics based on whether the Soviet Union and the United States have fought the war, it may mean the end of the world. The United States and the Soviet Union have never fought. <br /> <br /> If we were only conventional weapons, the idea of ​​another war, war "able to win", in Europe and Asia was not envisaged. <br /> <br /> I do not think they should get rid of this movie. Cinema students should be seen as a wonderful example of "how not to make a film." <br /> <br /> Must be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
