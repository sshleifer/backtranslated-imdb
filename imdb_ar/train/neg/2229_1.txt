Maybe this is not fair, because I reached the middle of the film. One of the few films I could not actually see due to lameness. <br /> <br /> The representation is terrible, the camera action is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the entire film is unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a coke deal, coke is kept in a small bag - not an expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same dumb sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's the loudest pitch) and they use pistols in the sound effects. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever.
