This may be the worst show I've ever seen. Regardless of the taste of a sitcom about Hitler, it is not funny or amusing in any way. It's very much like the sitcom in the 1950s in humor and confrontation, but while it can be done well in I Love Lucy, it's not funny here. I think the show was based on Grandma's "appearance, that Hitler is a comic character," but he is no longer fixed in all respects. The man who plays Hitler is so complex that it is difficult for him to sit alone. I wonder what could have made the network think that this was a good idea to broadcast. I thought America had some taste, but the British pushed us to win this time. America will never broadcast a sitcom about Hitler, even though we have offered it to the slavery of Lincoln, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. You may not see this show at all, as it only broadcasts one episode, and may not be played on a DVD.
