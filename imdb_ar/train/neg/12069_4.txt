Film director Carl Monson, first class Z, was one of the most prolific filmmakers working in the field of huge, low-budget chaos. His films are full of inefficient paperwork, funny acting, boring sub-plots and a comfortable dialogue. This figure brutally kills guests staying at the family palace. Unfortunately, this film is almost non-bloody. You do not actually see murders except with shadows and a few spots of blood. The pace is lethargic and the plot is rather interesting. It made me feel efficient, but the lack of distortion and distortion made me feel disappointed. Beware of four out of 10. Just beware: Make no mistake in filming Monson with Andy Miligan's Blood Legacy.
