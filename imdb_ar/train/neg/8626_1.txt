Looking at the other comments, I was surprised that there were no warnings to potential viewers about what they were looking for when renting the trash. First, I hired this thing knowing that it was a knockout Indiana Jones. What I got was one of the most offensive films I can remember while trying to sit down and made it even more shocking through relatively high production values ​​in the film. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is the spoiler, but if so, be careful ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is seeing Bimbo being raped from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief, while staring at her dead eyes from her other big broken head, by all means, rented this flick. If not, I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think about it, this scene briefly summarizes the film so there is nothing else I really need to say about it.
