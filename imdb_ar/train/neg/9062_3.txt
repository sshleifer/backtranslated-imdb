This film was different because it did not show typical gay stereotypes that I used to see. But this does not change the fact that it completely lacks a story. I'm sure there are many gay men who are happy to see themselves as photographers on the screen, since black gay characters are rarely seen, and when these characters are usually not fully developed. But, how hard it was for a writer to actually write a story with the beginning, the middle and the end. Or what about a story focused on them. In fact there does not seem to be a point in this film, and although it is a low budget film, there is still no excuse for not having a story or plot.
