Andy Lau starring another policeman's story. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for police officers and is also close to the top of a drug trafficking ring (Lao). The film begins as we watch the police as they try to make a bust of drugs just to see him go into pieces. After that, we met the drug addicted young mother and her daughter who lived near Nick and his friends and police, and after 45 minutes the film was closed and the news was reported. Good behavior and a wonderful look at this is a film that does not involve him as I have seen for a long time. Not bad as such only you really do not care. I mean I really do not care at all. I have already begun to do something else. I totally forgot that I got a translated film, which I did not care about. I wish I had hated the film, but the film was so strange that it had almost no impression of me (it's not so much that I can sleep until I just ignore it). Come on the box called Chinese Scarface, what after his death? This is the one to avoid.
