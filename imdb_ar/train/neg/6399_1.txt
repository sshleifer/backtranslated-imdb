First: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into gangs for a ruthless kid. They have sold themselves in this one, worse than the character Pryor. Second: A terrible, overly emotional scenario that could have been used in Harold Lloyd's film, which is very tacky. Three: Choose a black representative like a game. The ethnic text of this is unbearable, as never treated. No message here, Pryor can play the role of any comedian. Four: This kid ... I wish I could get back in time and prevent him from acting ever ... That means movies like that and Kid Co. Perhaps I did not make ... My childhood was free of their power to falsify the mind. So if you want to watch two great comedies immerse themselves in a sweet KDE flick, go ahead. If you want to see them in a good thing, review the work of the old Standard in Pryor and Gleason in something better, like honeymoon.
