After seeing the credits with only one name I knew and this preacher in this film (Ross Conway), I did not expect much of this film and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife by convincing others that she is crazy and will take their lives. It is not known to the husband that the plastic shape skull he uses, by contrast, is the specter of a woman whose first dead wife seemed to take revenge on her mind and use a real skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony in the end. If you feel tired one night late and you need to sleep, it will help you sleep.
