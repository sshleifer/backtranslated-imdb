I saw this first when it was selected as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and I think it might be interesting. Moreover, I am a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it began with the appearance and appearance of his 1930s drawings. With each of these, I thought he would take my interest. I was wrong. After only a few minutes, I had a fast forward button down. I ran through about 15 minutes, and I thought it was. <br /> <br /> After that, I read some other reviews here and I think I did not give her enough chance. I recorded it again and watched it through. There are 75 minutes of my life I do not go back to. <br /> <br /> I can not believe there are no more bad reviews. I personally think it is difficult to reach the minimum 10-line suspension. How many ways to say this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film appears to be made by a small number of young children willing to prepare for the world's anger and think they are capable of breasts and breasts. And vomits jokes. Characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame; it basically tunes the tone, moves through A-E, reaches the clear "F" and has no idea where to go. The journey through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the following ones. <br /> <br /> Across the board, the whole movie is what you expect from someone trying Stone Park outside Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is not funny. This may be amusing if you are high. Otherwise, it is not.
