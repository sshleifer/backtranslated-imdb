Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka the violence SH! T 3) is really. I heard rumors, read reviews - but I had to take my own opinion. Well, let me tell you - it's blowing !!! The worst work of any film ever produced, the dubbing that should have been done while neglecting all those involved is a complete waste, and the FX FX is harmless and funny, no conspicuous plot, and "cinematography" that my grandmother seems to have photographed with the camcorder, A joke - made of tin chips - and the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three men are stranded on an island where a group of eccentrics are carried with a sword of plastic and tin. Two prisoners were released along with a rebel of freaks on the island, giving them a chance to start one day before being chased by the rest of the "tribe" ... this is largely ... <br /> Frankly - This is one of the worst films that I have had the misfortune of subjugating myself as well. The budget should have been about $ 200 and was spent entirely on foreign exchange (which may not be a bad idea ...). There is nothing for ZOMBIE DOOM other than the naive, bright-looking viewer with lots of HORRIBLY dialogue. This movie makes other non-budget trips such as PREMUTOS: LORD OF LIVING DEAD look like Titanic. Some may classify ZD in the category "very bad, it's good" - I think if you're already drunk or high and watch it with a few friends like MST3K - I think it can be seen that way. But not me. I hated everything very much about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally horrifying and listed as a "bonus" in the ZD Shock-O-Rama version) indicates Andreas Schnaas's other work - it should prevent him from doing anything to do with making a film again Under the death penalty. There is a fun kung fu battle in the last half of the movie, a lot of blood - so I will give this one very generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.
