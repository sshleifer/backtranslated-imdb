I will be the first to admit this when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my reading about how much I hate this film. <br /> <br /> This is about summarizing it too. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like the idea of ​​this film. The cinema was good. The mood was pleasant. The representation was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is hazy, inaccurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I'm an Indian guy in the quarter, and for some reason I'm insulted, personally, because of the nature of Whitaker. First of all, he's a black man. This is not a racist remark, I swear. The idea of ​​a white, Hispanic or even Native American person swinging with the katana on the roof of the house harms everything Katana represents. The Katana represents the samurai spirit, imbued with the spirits of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. To use Ghost Dog as his weapon instead of Katana is also an insult to the code and the souls inside, and where did Katana get anyway? It must be one of those replicas, which insult the samurai layer even more. <br /> <br /> Also, Ghost Dog did not show any honor. Near the end of the film, he shot a bodyguard in the back through a window and then shot a man by shooting him in the face by draining a faucet. This is not just a cowardly way to kill an enemy; it is like a ninja; silent killers a group denied by the samurai exist, but they do not hate them at all. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss, when he discovers that his boss is left. Do you know what the real samurai does when he learns that his master is bad or not disgraceful? He kills himself, to prove that he prefers death and then falls to the level of his stumbling master. <br /> <br /> Everything about personality was a big contrast to the real code that all Samurai adheres to: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So, we have a wonderful cinematic and good atmosphere etc. It includes a comic and hypothetical plot (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it), making it a general film unsatisfactory, an insult to everything that bears the honorable bushi (Samurai) Dear . <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Yes
