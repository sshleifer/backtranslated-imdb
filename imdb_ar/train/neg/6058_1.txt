The plot was thwarted and surprised by the irreconcilable differences of opinion in judicial chaos with one side pro-life and the other destructive of Satan's seeds. The horror was abandoned and replaced by the total dull effect, and perhaps it was supposed to be awful, but instead showed a bad dose of beliefs that ridiculed each other to death, despite the same title. Since you are a fan of Masters of Horror from the start, this ridiculous plot has crashed with its harsh images like a weak old rocking chair after sitting on it. I see this episode being thrown together from the start, and never taking off anywhere other than seeing what it deserves and relieving it when it finally reaches the "end."
