I have already seen wonderful stories, but the story is so incredible that it is very close to irony. A young man and a young man undergo a heart transplant the day after his marriage, in some way witnessing his surgery and plotting his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for this phenomenon, what happens next is a combination of dialogue between ... Say ... souls? ... perhaps a real life where a dedicated mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shade of suspense or suspense; it is just a combination of a bad plot and a simple series of coincidences that can never occur in life. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film is completely lacking in quality - in fact, director Goppi Harold is doing a good job in managing a good cast of actors including Hayden Christensen in his first major role after removing Anken Skywalker, The brilliant Jessica Alba, and Lina Olen's super-talent. Everyone deserved a better story.
