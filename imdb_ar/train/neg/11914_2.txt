Sherry Appleby is a gentle incarnation of evil that turned into a good devilish clone of Billy, El. But I am superior to myself, seeing that Lilith was the first woman God made as a companion to Adam. But she got all the wicked evil women, and God removed them from Eden. A secret order known as The Fath captures it but does not kill it, so now it's memory loss (which is not really well explained). The world that got the blood injection of Lilith. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph seems frighteningly twisted, it is because it is. The film is dull, general, and for a film that contains a conspiracy soaked in theology, he does not seem to know what licks out. It seems that this film that was shown in the basement is CGIed is a leading failed series. All I can say is that the fact that he was not captured is a resounding Amen. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Comment by author / director Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regina. (Also contains the choice of "available also" you think you will be led to some clips, but cover DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM add-ons: Final filming and deleted scenes in PDF format
