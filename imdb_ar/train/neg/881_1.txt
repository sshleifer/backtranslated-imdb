Thanks to some of the infamous home video distributors who brought in the so-called independent German series, Four For Venice is not only bad, but very bad. Very awful, so much so that I was thrown into the second-hand shop for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte married couple reached an agreement to have sex on Tuesday just because of their hectic career schedule. Eva and Louise are a couple who live from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Louis, an artist. Nick indirectly caused Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Lewis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick. Louis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would fly to London to do something about his artistic work, but the truth is that he flies to Venice with Charlotte for a holiday in adultery. Eva grabbed Nick and pulled her two children along to Venice to face her. Venice's journey ends with the fall of Nick and Eva to each other. <br /> <br /> The flight from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva is a failure in comedy. It does not only look meaningless, but also hard. In the film, Nick tried to ask for help for several ways, but it was useless. Either the strangers around him are acting like a fool, or they are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Comedy also had a tendency to add more unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. While some problems can be resolved in the general sense, no one in the film uses common sense to solve the problem. They would rather go into one big tour to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> This is very bad, so that Venice's beautiful landscapes fail to attract the film's reputation.
