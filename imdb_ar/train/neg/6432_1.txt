The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a sign given to the senator, who relied on the public's ignorance of the World War II aircraft. The rear defender facing the defender relies on a latch that would prevent the back cannon from shooting the tail of the aircraft by preventing the gun from firing when pointed to the tail. When the senator was training on the ground one day, he managed to shoot the tail of the plane. He could not have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The responsible artillery officer, in front of the public, admitted in front of the camera, that he was responsible - he made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact, shows how much his side. This film is designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> His PBS program was much better. He has worked hard, clever, and politically ambitious to overcome the extraordinary disadvantages of upgrading to extraordinary levels. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but the shooting on the tail of a plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the audience likes simple stories, stories, so they do not have to think.
