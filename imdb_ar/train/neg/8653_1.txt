I went to this hoping to have a "provoking thought" gem people had reviewed this. I love indie films and are expected to dig this too. Find out what is the hot button that these themes are expected to be amusing by, maybe even see the outsiders' view. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow .... If you torture or distort yourself, you might like it. Personally, I do not like the idea that I might have urinated or cut myself so I thought it was garbage. Bad script, bad behavior, bad story, bad direction, bad editing .... i can continue. I have no idea why one of the reviewers claimed that he or she was raising a political point of view by giving this film 10 years. This is misleading and ignorant. Vote for a movie on IMDb does not set a precedent! It only allows others to think that a trash bomb like this is fine to watch as long as it's controversial (this is not the case, it's trying to be very difficult but it fails). <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is bad after 15 minutes of your prayer until all the main characters die in a frightening way. Unfortunately, they die, but not in the painful literature that would give the viewer some justice or justification because he saw two hours of folly that they carried. <br /> <br /> Offer yourself a service, just do not bother. I got this movie in a box bargains at my local video store for 0.50, and I feel ripped off!
