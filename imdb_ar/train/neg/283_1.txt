For the film, this movie looked like one of those after school specials, only a lower budget and cut everything else. I think this was supposed to be an inspiring film of some sort, but it did not work for me. As preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance, but what about it? There is no excitement in this film. Dialogue is intrigued and smiling to death. Of course, the entire film looks like bad clich√©s. The acting was less than stellar, although this had a great relationship with what was given to the actors (or in this case not) to work with them. Moreover, the poor song choices, with really bad lyric lyrics, were embarrassed by all the actors involved. They are all talented, but you can not say from this film. This is just my opinion of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe 1/10
