The fighting scenes were fantastic. I loved the old and new cylinders and how they painted those on their side. She was the end she hated. I was disappointed because it was Earth but 150k years ago. But to travel all this way just to start over again? are you kidding me? 38 thousand people fought for their existence and once they reach paradise, they give up technology? Not possible. Sure, they were eating paper and rationing food, but that was over. They can live like humans again. They only have one good doctor. What they will do when someone has a toothache does not mind giving birth ... true. No one has made this choice.
