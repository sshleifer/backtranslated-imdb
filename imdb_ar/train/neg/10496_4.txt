Gday Mates! I just watched Croc Hunter movie. It was fine but the show seemed more realistic. This sounds just like a longer AnimalPlanet ring with more entertaining lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described snakes like subcutaneous canines. yeeeowch! For facts you know that hurts you. Unable to jump high? Hes all grabbed by tail and stuff. There were two main split shots in this film. When Terry finds that Joey's baby goes like "we care for them, just like a baby." WOAH! I thought she would work and breastfeed this baby. This would make it PG-13 though. While in Terry, notice anyone in the movie and a lot of Terry know about mating rituals. She knows her sex material. The film happens in Queensland, Austrailia. I want Koala, Dengwa and Joya! <br /> <br /> Steve's Sui's dog has a goal in this film. Although they are small proving useless against the pregnant hottie of dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else is watching this, try to agree with me to say that a fat fat fish lady with a herd of dogs was on the right shooting a crocodile. He was eating her sheep !! I'll be mad too!
