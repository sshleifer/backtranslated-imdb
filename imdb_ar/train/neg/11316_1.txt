Knights was just the beginning of a series, a pilot, one could say. The plot (I should not really call it, there was no conspiracy) was not logical at all and there were many mistakes, such as [warning, I summed up the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, There were only a couple of these cyborgs (bad guys) but after the peak, Nea discovered that there were many of them. It was said that it was hard to kill cyborgs, but after training for a month, Nea could have killed them with one blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a real kick. I was not surprised at all when I discovered that the leading star was a kicker. <br /> <br /> There was one positive thing in the whole film: I gave a lot of laughter when I saw it and talked about it with my friends. I recommend watching it, if you need to laugh.
