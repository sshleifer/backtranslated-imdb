One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The terrible act, the laughable "movement" (obviously the cars are moving slowly), a terrible text, a frighteningly unsatisfactory ending and an incompetent direction make a film. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good representative, but he should be ashamed of the waste. There is no great tension inside the car, and when the characters get stuck on moments of hope, they laugh like uncommon pessimism for some reason, even a "five fold rise" when they see the bridge low! <br /> <br /> The series of events that lead these people to share the same credibility of the car. It seems to be based on real events, though? If this is the case, it is clear that the truth is strange to the imagination! It is therefore unfortunate that he was portrayed in an incompetent manner.
