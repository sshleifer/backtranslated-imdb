The heavily heated "Bonjour tristesse" plot is taken from Franso Sagan's first novel, which became the best seller, although God knows why. For teenagers who want to get rid of a potential parent, they may have a certain attractiveness. Do not take into account the fact that David Niven plays the role of playboy father and Deborah Kerr in a possible mother step. Unfortunately, a lot falls on Jan Seberg's weak shoulders. It is beautiful and easily meets the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that they can hit poses but they can not act. Anyone who saw her as Joan Arque in Otto Preminger's film in St. Joan - the first film for Spurge - knew she could not bear a movie at the age of 19. This film, also by Breminger, achieves the first "promise". It was her second film. She was 20 years old. That Niven and Kerr can compensate for Seberg's lack of acting ability? Not an opportunity? Seberg's character is at the center of the story, and although she is beautiful, she is convincing even though she may be physically 17 years old, but she can not meet the emotional demands of the role. I do not know whether she has become a successful actress in her short life because she had no effect on my consciousness in her subsequent photographs. But anyone who thinks this film is better than average does not need to check the taste. Despite Nevin and Kier, this story is still a solo event that was performed in such a way by a young girl who was in desperate need of acting lessons.
