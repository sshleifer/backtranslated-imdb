What a terrible film. The rotten tomatoes were a good rating for this too. Do not be fooled by positive comments; it was not scary. It was not funny. It was not clever. It will not hold your attention. I've just lost two hours of my life watching this clown. The computer generated the monster was interesting to know the first couple times. After about 15 minutes no longer entertainment. The dialogue was terrible, it must be something to translate. The other negative that popped up was the American Idiot. 3 were photographed and they lacked personality, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to mediate this because we should have 10. The staff at the video shop should have slapped me to submit this address to the counter.
