Have you heard before that people "send out their intentions?" Well in this film, the actions of characters do more than future telegraph plans - appear drunk in your home and broadcast on your head. This can be forgiven if the setting is used better, or if the characters are more attractive or accurate. Ambeth Davidetz is not obscure, but wooden, and Kenneth Branagh does not succeed in conveying the magic of the scream that his character may be written. Unpopular characters, and "southerly" southern dialects employed by British actors.
