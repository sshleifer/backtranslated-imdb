This movie was terrible. I gave it a high class 2 as I saw worse, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the vulgar start to getting the film end to the beginning and getting back to the beginning in the end, this movie used everything in the box of tricks used in filmmaking just for it, like a kid with a lot of games. There was an endless tedious, endless narrative, slow motion, freezing frame, masculine memories, compact images, etc. - none of them made a boring film any better. <br /> <br /> He is called "16 Years of Alcohol", but there was little drinking or wine and there was no depiction of withdrawal with the movie jumping everywhere without any coherent feeling. The story was badly written and very ambitious and the direction was both weak. It is a shame that people have lost more money for Mr. Jobson, who was previously known for being in a trash collection and on television as logically as this film works. <br /> <br /> I have had great difficulty in seeing this to the end, but hoping to get better I passed bitterness but it was really time consuming and I'd be better off not bothering.
