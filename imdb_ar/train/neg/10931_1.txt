I went to see this film with fairly low expectations, considering it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not. I can hardly sit in the film without wanting to go out. I went with my child (10 and 13 years old) and kept asking "How long?" After it lasted to the end, I kept wondering who would agree to this text. Even Fred Willard's individual could not save the trivial dialogue, government jokes and vulgar plot. I suggest that everyone who wrote this film and directed it (I use the term loosely) should attend a screenwriting class on the Internet or drop it by the community college for a film category. At least, there are many books about output, screen writing and film production that will teach them something about structure, planning, dialogue and speed.
