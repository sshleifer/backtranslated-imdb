Scary Movie 3 is very hard to put into words. He makes films like "Wanted" in Malibu look like an Oscar material, just let's say it. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was very fun, one of the best spoofing movies of the 1990s, coming from a wonderful team shook in the former world with no threat to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened? After the tragedy of Scary Movie 2, I thought changing staff and staff would help things, but worse. <br /> <br /> Within 20 minutes, I smiled twice. Did not laugh again, the jokes were recycled and authenticity was not a clear factor. The fact that the majority of people on this site have voted at this writing stage 10/10 has made me feel physically ill. When there are great clicks like School of Rock out, which already contain funny jokes, anyone who misses his money on such a trip needs to check his head. <br /> <br /> No stars / ****
