... for the LT to pick this one. First, the film was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst scenario I need for this event, or we do not have a film: If Willis's job is to save the doctor, but she insisted that her "people" get him out of the mission, he would put it on the first helicopter and the refugees would go to the border without it. Would not have jeopardized its refugee package. This is not the way it works. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have a drama. That's why we make films, because reality is not quite complicated. However, I think Willis and the good doctor had a practical chemistry. However, there are also some improved battle scenes in the film. Not a waste of time, "Sun Tears" is worth a DVD rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
