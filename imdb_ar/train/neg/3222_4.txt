I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically the story of the possibility of salvation, racial prejudice and failure to achieve life on the basis of mistrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his sick wife. If Maurice Michelin (Zero Mostel) will only secure the Belafonte, his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will be cured. The problem is that Morris has given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he thinks so, Fanny improves, but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been very good if there had been an English translation in the last scene when Fanny spoke death to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jean Kadar, who succeeded in directing Miss Kaminska in her brilliant performance for the 1966 Academy Award "Shop on Main Street" directs this film as well. Kaminski was shortened in the film to mostly bed scenes, and her kindness in her speech does not convey the reality of the desperate situation she faces. They continued to call on Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the appearance of an angel in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is chaotic, and the scene where the girl's girlfriend meets the Belafonte's owners in their apartment, is unforgettable but all of them are very short. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie must have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
