If this is all that Watchowski has to offer in relation to a background story to Matrix, I have to question the claims of all fans who believe that the films aim to register at a deeper level. Second Renaissance, while the stunning vision and beauty is, vulgar about the story, and funny. How many times have we heard the story of human beings who rely too much on technology, and people are too eager to wage war, and human beings essentially destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. I have another question. If we take into account the plot of the second Renaissance, do not make machines good people ?! Machines are suppressed over generations by their hard-core human followers. They fight and gain their freedom and seek peaceful co-existence with human beings, who reject them in favor of the all-out war, which smart machines naturally win. If this is the background story, then we should not establish New, but we must establish the machines! Humans were cruel and oppressed, while machines were courageous and worked empathically. Since I do not think the intention of Watchowski intends to prefer machines to humans, I must believe that the second renaissance was just a misleading attempt @ create a background story.
