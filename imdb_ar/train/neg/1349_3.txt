I got this DVD for over two years and decided to watch it just yesterday. I do not know why it took me a long time like Display Tool Inspector and even Gadgetinis new tool. Although it may contain a bright palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated film, there are some old things that have lost this gadget in the toilet directly. <br /> <br /> First of all, the Gadget Gadget Classic Theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to waive by making a similar look, but it is still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a car. Plus it looks very nice and rounded instead of being wonderful. Penny no longer has a computer notebook, and she and Brown hardly ever appear. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. There is something about the transformation formula and Dr. Chloe who used it for evil has never been revealed but that's all I got. What was the deal with the short / giant Italian man I would never know. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> If the title is anything that passes, the latter case does not end in any way. It remains in force, so the cause of the latter is also ambiguous. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is an insult to showing a wonderful cartoon oddly absent on a DVD, but do not let it ask you to buy any DVD for the Inspector Gadget. I sold this seconds later to see it. No child will like this or appreciate it and fans do not like it in the old program.
