American films about war and Nazis can not be good. They can not refrain from becoming stupid and following an agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy and very proud, and the Americans are modest, yet they have a great deal of ability, rationality and humanity. Come on, stop this nonsense. The main character says something like "In this trial, we have to make the war of aggression a crime." Is America a peaceful country with a world defense budget of 420 billion dollars (China's second with only 51 billion dollars)? Do you simply spend in this without any ... ROI? Why do you envision America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I hate movies very much with an agenda - they throw art at hell and try to convince us to believe something. Hollywood should place a sticker on the movies, just like the parenting companies. We must have a "crap consultant", a "publicity consultant" or a "politically correct consultant" in some films. This is one of them.
