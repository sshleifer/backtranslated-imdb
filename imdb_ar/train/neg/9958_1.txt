If the events of events are easy to regression, retrograde, tolerant, anti-institutional, civilization, liking you, this is the ideal film. A very poor script, with an often inaudible dialogue and an outrageously portable camera around, this film presents the world with simple and attractive Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and discontented at best, Worst. The only refuge from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a lot of primitive yawning and childish regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the forest, where utopia takes the form of a rave-again, in the forest (naturally ...). Displays all the weaknesses in the first movie, and much more.
