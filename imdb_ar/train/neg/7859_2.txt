my Lord. This film was awful. I can not complain too much. I went to see it just to get it. I did enough, sort of. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the film was at first, where a woman was forced to have a terribly transformed baby. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that more was a prominent actor in the film The Soldier of Hispanic, who was a supporting actor on Friday. Everyone in the film did a terrible job. It was one of the worst things that drove me to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be even uglier than the first. Not so. I was expecting to be even more horrific because the sequel and horror films are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I was expecting to be even more horrific as Gore and violence usually sell horror films these days (Grudge 2, São 3, Gibbers Cripps 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but in fact it was not as horrific as I was after another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first stage were disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying hard to make them so creepy that they were quite joyful. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing the female soldier's son clip on her camera phone saying "I love you, Mom" ​​four times. It was stupid to show that in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers. It was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel worse for her by showing it three times more than without reason. This movie was a joke.
