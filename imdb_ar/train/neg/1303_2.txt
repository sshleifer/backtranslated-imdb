Edward Montani is supposed to play Tattooed Stranger as a crime thriller with a small, blended Noir film of flavor. Instead, it's a bad look at low-budget, uninspired filmmaking. The plot is silly and the representation cruel and amateurish. John Miles, who has a fairly high profile in the industry, smiles all the time and everyone else acts with the same passion as characters in a government movie about driver safety. The film foresees such performances as "Let It Beaver" and "Father Knew Better" in New York's unnatural health vision in 1950. Why, the viewer can not see anyone lighting a barn until some beautiful women are met in a flophouse halfway through the movie . The only thing the film moves (along with its summary) is the excellent site footage coordinated by William Steiner. The low-budget film works for the benefit of cinematographer, where the footage is treated with good frame shots of New York City's interior and expansive exterior. Unless you want to enjoy the movie to select settings and camera angles, I suggest watching virtually any other movie.
