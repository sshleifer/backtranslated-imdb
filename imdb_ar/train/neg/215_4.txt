I'm not like Love Sick like the picture. Finally, the film reflected the sexual relationship between Alex and Cake and Sando, and their love of the triangle was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, and in the end, Alex woke up and realized that it would have no outcome and future. It ended with sadness. <br /> <br /> Theodore Giorgio was directed at the AMC Theater on Sunday at 12:00 pm on 08/10/06, and we saw the film together. After the film, he told viewers that the purpose of the film, which was intended to express Roman sexual relations, was a kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, sexual life is always complex everywhere, not feeling any particular impression and impact of the film. The love story of Alex and Kiki, Kiki and her brother Sandu was a bit of a neighborhood story. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons I do not like this film, first, the film did not like Tell us how they began to love? Sounds come after Alex moves to the building where Kiki lives, and two girls fall in love. It makes no sense at all. How will the girl fall in love with another girl instead of the man. Lots of fragments, you need to image and connect these stories through your mind. Second, the entire film did not see a scene of Alex and the sex cookie, that's what I was waiting for. However, it was still worth some of the parts to recommend. The "ear hole" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer from ear piercing pain to appreciate kIK love. It was an emotional scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, the scene they were lying in the football field, express their love were sincere and emotional.
