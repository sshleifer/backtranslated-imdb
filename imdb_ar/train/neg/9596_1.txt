Simply put, there is no point in trying to glorify any part of this film. <br /> <br /> It was a direct garbage. At first, you might think you're going around a visually stunning film ... and soon after that I was hit by a big bag of FAIL! The fighting is barely being militarized, the representation swings on the edge of the name, the music is not worth describing. There is only enough story that has created an excuse for making this film. The decisions taken by the characters and the way they treat them are weak, and they have done nothing but frustrating. I think the only reason behind the appearance of this film is to serve as a fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
