Considering the limits of this film (the entire movie in one setting - the music studio - only about 5 or 6 reps) it should have been much better. If you have these limitations in the film industry, how can lighting be so bad? The actors were terrible, they were talking less about acting than in Clarex, but it was a fun film, and it had no substance. Well, I tried, but it really failed. <br /> <br /> It's an attempt to be a self-reference in two parts, but the lines were delivered very badly by the actors, it was so bad. The main character is Neil Man, his pathetic loser. It was obvious that such a number of people were 10 people who made this movie and they all knew each other, and maybe they were real rock band, but unfortunately these people did not really have an idea of ​​how terrified they were. This was made in 2005, but they all seem very naive as it smiles on the pre-Grunge era only. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay for this (Starz on Demand is delivered again!) but it was less than that. The title "The Possessed" and not Studio 666, no matter what you do with the title, can not help this. This movie could have been much better - there is no excuse for this bad film when you have the obvious limited parameters of filmmakers when they do this, and working within these limits must make things you can control and things you can work with as best you can. Instead, they thought the mediocrity would be good enough. In that music video, what's wrong, I quickly followed it. <br /> <br /> So, the 2/10 is fair, if you're in the whole movie, I suspect you'll see this.
