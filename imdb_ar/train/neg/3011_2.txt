I was very excited to watch this film, where I was expecting a visual journey about the relationship between beauty and artistic nature, which contained types of wisdom such as "rivers and tides." However, this is not what you received. Instead, I get a somewhat uninspiring film about how the human industry is harmful to nature. This is clearly an entirely unconventional claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer appears to be at odds about the aesthetic qualities of his image and the supposed "moral" duty he takes on workers sometimes painting pictures along the ocean. Frankly, the pictures were not generally impressive. According to this "artist", the scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, a stupid movie. For people who want to feel comfortable with their environmental awareness ... but not for anyone who wants to think about the intricacies of the issues surrounding him.
