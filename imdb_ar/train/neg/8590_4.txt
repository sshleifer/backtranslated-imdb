Ironically. Anken (9 years) of angelic turns into a 19-year-old grocer, who looks somehow appealing to Amidala, a 5-year-old. Now Geek Warrior hero Gedi, 22, has some bad dreams, and requires that the slaughter of children and his friends and the full frame of his existence because an old crazy man convinced him a) that his precious wife may really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Virtues of virtue. <br /> <br /> I think people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally, not the deviant meaning of "fantastic", "fantastic", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi Wan Kenobi was a wise and gentle announcer for the entire series, but at the height, he pierces Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him suffering. Does anyone think this is a bit of a character? Not to mention that it was stupid to take advantage of his meeting, as it turned out. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent, reasonably motivated characters. None of this is here. The story could have been written by a 10-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the CGI is fantastic.
