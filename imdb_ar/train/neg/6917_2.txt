Again the same familiar story about a man (a writer here) selling his soul to the devil in order to achieve his desired ambition in life: success. ("We must go home and write better"), silly lines in order to understand the "strong" Christian message (our only ambition in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long experience at the end where Hopkins The Devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or sinister at all) for all the bad things I've created in this unwanted character. Not bad efforts of the actors (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in the role of "Sex and the City" again, akroyed with some funny lines in his limited role). Note Also try an unknown film from Greece entitled "Alloimono stous neous", a wonderful adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to restore his youth)
