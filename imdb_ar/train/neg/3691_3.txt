I'm not a fan of Rajnakant in the first place, but Papa was a disappointment. Between an awesome story, the movement and songs were only modest. The story becomes very preaching. Instead of running for a position like NTR or MGR, Rajni looked like he was working as a great teacher in Tamil Nadu. My wife told me that ever since the movie came out, Rajni had sworn to do any other movies! <br /> <br /> We were lucky at first because we bought Babu (old from Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this movie .... it was a wonderful film, it was compensated for buying this dude ... but it Makes Papa look worse compared! <br /> <br /> Bryan
