Oh, Sam Marovic, we know you tried hard. This is your authorship, a shining example for the rest of us that you are definitely worthy of nomination at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as provided for on your website which dates back to 1998). Unfortunately, it is best to remain silent and think that you are foolish to talk and remove any doubt. With Ben & Arthur, you can do just that. <br /> <br /> It appears that the film's scenario guides us to the real stranger with every new scene, apparently compiled with a lack of education or education. It's a crazy excuse for a story that might also be the best ally of the film. Starting with naive, Ben and Artur gay characters are trying to get married, and go even further to fly around the country to do so, under the magnificent palm trees of Vermont. But, all this position is just a prelude to blood. Then more blood, more and more blood. I mean there must be at least $ 20 of fake blood components in the last third of this film. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is a technical slip. From sound to editing to music, which consists of a single mysterious bass note hanging on a keyboard, it's a wonder that the film is cohesive with any media you see on it. It is shameful, therefore, to miss some nice offers for amateurs. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you made five figures about this click rentals or anything that drives poor people (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we do not laugh with you.
