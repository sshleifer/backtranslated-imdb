I did not watch the entire film. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and suggested to anyone thinking of watching himself and he stops himself before removing the disc from the box. <br /> <br /> I love Mafia's tragic and comedy films but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is simply trying to make it hard for the audience to laugh, and it seems that the plot is an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is overpriced and lacks precision or credibility - all his strange behavior happens to be fabricated - Chris Kattan is clearly "acting" rather than playing a role - he completely dissuades you from the story. Each scene is quite predictable, the "comic event" that will happen to the group is obvious once each scene is presented. In comedy films such as Mr. Bean, the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathize with the motivations of the characters and the initial event and the position that ends with the character does not telegraph it. However, Corky gives the feeling that he is deliberately trying desperately to attract laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris does not play such an alien character (which never relates to other characters in the film) and his behavior is completely inexplicable (except trying to draw laughter) and comedy scenes were not predictable and modeling - all jokes Seemed very familiar) this film could have been viewable. But it is not. Do not see it.
