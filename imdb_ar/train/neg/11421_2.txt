I'm likely to get a lot of hate because of the dislike of this film - I did not deal with the proper nostalgia for the eyes of the generation before me. But enough to say - the St Elmo's fire was somewhat bitter, even with Brat Pack movies. <br /> <br /> Here is another wonderful example of the arrogant, arrogant neurosurgeon who immersed himself in everything in the 1980s (rent, anyone?). The plot is almost non-existent and philosophies are perfect at best and poorly delivered the rest of the time. The total absence of anything like sympathetic personalities does not help the situation. There was really no growth, and there was no movement forward at all. Even the atomic suicide scene was actually neutral by refusing to allow death again or anything resembling the reality or adult life in. <br /> <br /> Every person who cuts cookies works simply to make you hate them in the most dangerous and predictable things. Possible way. Stalker is creeping for no apparent reason other than Stalker and Andie MacDowell. Jackass is doing all he can to constantly remind you that, well, he is a jackass. The Gorgeous Slut hides truly deep dreams in a harsh way of life. The mood of the poet and the ropes about 3/4 full of film so he can detect (!) He actually is full of teddy bears, sunshine and rainbow. Finally, the Virgin becomes a full and happy person after each Virgin wants to have one hot roll in a bag with Jacas before giving it up to change it (in real time this time). Cheating the bastard until it is time to fall into it. Finally, femininity revolves around the sacred water cavity over which spirit performs "commitment". <br /> <br /> What drives me to the last beef - what is the super cement bond that binds these people together as friends? I can not imagine being with just one of them - think now of the whirlpool created by all those narcissism positioned in one bar. They were all very terrible for each other in the toilets, near rape, sleeping with them everywhere. The cherry after two BFFs behaved like a total baboon after a femininity tug, it's like, "Um, I do not really want to be with any of you anymore. I've tied one with the other at any time, but none of you is satisfied enough to commit (that's not talk!). "They all smile as if to say," Jolie, I never thought of that! <br /> <br /> Just not so. Kinda in the way that watching this film is not.
