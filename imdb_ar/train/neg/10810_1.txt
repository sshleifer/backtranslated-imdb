There is only one thing I need to say about this film - the scene where there is a difficult number of music with the character of Francis Capra about the desire to be fair; do not see this film. The story is awesome, the representation is terrible (come on, it's hard!) And the best seeing Capra in Frey and Willie (equally awesome) twice before I see this movie.
