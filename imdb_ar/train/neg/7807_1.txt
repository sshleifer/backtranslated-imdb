This DVD was picked up at the dollar store. The DVD was on the rack for $ 2, but since it included Michael Madsen, I thought that since I never saw the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I must say I did not. T-like film. The film is more like a documentary or a declaration of religion than anything else. I found that using the director of the previous memoir did not add to the story line for me. You'd better view the story line in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not put it in place like any other commentator, but it may be a moment before I think about watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since Michael Madsen's debut was, may have archival value at a later date.
