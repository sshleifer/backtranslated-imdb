What a shame that Alan Clark should be associated with this kitten. This does not rule out it; gather a group of boys and some Stellas with some whale once this again and again spin on the ground in tears of laughter. Lost night stuff is great. The Hunter has a well-publicized theme in the late 1980s - the troublemakers were well organized and genuinely uninterested in football - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent ???). But how can Clark convince us that any of the bipartisan actors coming out of another low-quality television production (Grange Hill) or soon to go on a drama of poor quality (Eastenders) can make us think that football is very difficult. Thugs are funny. Do you really believe that the ICF (on which the drama is based) will never go to another city to fight through SIX blokes only? <br /> <br /> The ICF raided subway stations and the like with hundreds. Andy Nichols Scully needs to read before thinking about a story of this kind. The representation is appalling and provides most laughs - Oldman is a camp so it is incredible. Most of them seem like they should be in Mr Matte's bath bubble. A real inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera that he thinks he can make.
