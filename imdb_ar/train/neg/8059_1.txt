This film concerns a very young girl, Kasi (Melissa Sagmiller) who leaves her family and moves to become a university student. One night Cassie and her friends decided to go to a big party with lots of drinking and dancing, while Cassie would ride with her girlfriend she loved but she never told him she loved him. During her driving Casey, a car was stopped halfway, and she could not avoid an accident, and as a result lost a large number of lives with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotional and has nightmares that make her feel terrified of her boyfriend's return to life and face men trying to kill her as she struggles to see who her true friends are, and who wants her death. Cassie dreams that her friend is in love after his death and finds another man in her bed and is told that she asks him to make love. This is the film's director, not good at all.
