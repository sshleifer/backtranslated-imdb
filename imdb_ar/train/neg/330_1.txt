I wanted to punch the TV. Watching him was torture. I hated that. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually love him but not in this one. I wanted to break a DVD. This is the most exciting movie in the world. The comedian who is jealous of him is repugnant. The only funny part of the distance is black rock music that gets all the girls. It was very disturbing and I wanted to hit the TV. Do not buy this movie unless you want to meet anyone. If you even love Adam Sandler little, do not buy it. It will make you hate it. If you see it in your store, hide it and put it all in danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 you paid for it.
