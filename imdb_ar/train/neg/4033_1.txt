It pains me to write a bleak review but I do not encourage these people to do so. First, just because the film is made with a small budget does not make it good or automatically loved. In fact, in this case, the small budget may be the only achievement of films in that it prevented the waste of large sums of money on a single-legged race horse. Have you ever seen comedy in the theater? Did he hear people laughing and thinking, "What do you publish on the cocks?" Well, even these twins were not laughing. Things became very bad halfway I took my first bath cat at all. This is not a film, it's children .... There are no monkeys with pictures that make you feel you are moving to France. Got to go, there's a clown in my door .............
