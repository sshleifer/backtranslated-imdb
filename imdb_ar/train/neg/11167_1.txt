Jack Black can usually make me a simple Senkra by breathing, but in this film ... <br /> <br /> Alongside the direction, writing, plot lack and continuous integration (assisted and incited through direct camera shots), the beat rate is 0.50 a joke , Was still quite a waste of time. The idea seems promising, but what is missing there is the complete lack of comedy and some of the worst trends I have seen on this side of the tube. <br /> <br /> I kept hearing that this film depicts Mexicans very negatively. While this is undoubtedly true, I do not really believe that this film aims to be racist. I think this is more a result of an "innovative" team trying desperately to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them shouting from behind the camera: "Hey, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for love of all things, stubborn, laugh!" <br /> <br /> But put racism aside. When you come down to it, anyone who steals money and time to watch this heap of remaining fried legumes should be humiliated, from IMO.
