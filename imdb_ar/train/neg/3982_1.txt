In order to love God please do not see this movie! It's a waste of time, predictable plot, as well as romantic scenes. Trying to build a lot with very little, this wicked and wicked villain is predictable is just lame. Characters are not developed, and most of the film is filled with footage from Rome, which is more interesting than the actual film. Moreover, representation is a disgrace. I know everyone is trying to find his right place, but this is really a disaster. I can not believe that someone has already paid millions of pounds to put this film on the screen. Do not waste money or time in this movie, go see your grandmother or anything worth it.
