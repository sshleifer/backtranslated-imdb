As a great admirer of only the first two seasons of the BSG and independent feature of Razor BSG I was hoping that this release would bring the franchise back to its original days. I usually do not have a problem with science fiction, which is often centered around dialogue rather than visual gains and special effects. If the script is narrow with some original ideas presented by good actors, one can create a deep film with little money spent by the CGI. This package does not contain any of the above requirements. The virtual reality world created by terrorist teenagers was ridiculous and unreasonable. This scene was simply put to raise the version rating to Restricted. It does not mean that teenagers do not like to dig virtual reality full of sex, violence and heavy dance music. It's the part of teenagers who have the same depth, reason, or political and religious passion to create such future programs or become suicide bombers that baffle me. These children certainly are not from this planet. The movie is shown like a soap opera with only the last ten minutes that are a little interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz gave Cyborg his divine conscience by promoting the firmware of the student was amused if not amused. But this old concept was better portrayed and more believable in the original classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica has torn her only interesting idea from the old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this film was nice and non-original and cheap-looking, using recycled CGI from the Caprica of BSG. I doubt I will see this space soap when it's first shown on Sci-Fi. Unless of course I suffer from a bad bout of insomnia at this time the show will definitely be treated. ZZZZZZZ
