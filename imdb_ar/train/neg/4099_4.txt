The mulva is placed in sugercoma by Teen Ape. When you wake up, it is hotter (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and revenge for those who have sinned. Since the subtitle and the box box mean that it actually takes off in Kill Bill, but this is Chris Seaver's film, it's a very incompetent satire (and I use that term too loosely) to say that this is better than the first film, But the truth is that I was drunk from my ass when I saw the previous film so much that I can not hope to compare the two at this point in time. But I have to enjoy them since I bought the series (see when I'm drunk and I like it, because there is no better word and crappy movies full and full) there are some loud laugh moments (very few) but I remember Bonejack being entertaining. Well at least with just over an hour, we ended up very quickly because of what it was worth. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio commentary by Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon, and the LP Gang; Lloyd Kaufman in 6 minutes in honor of low budget photos; 2 minute fake commercial drink.
