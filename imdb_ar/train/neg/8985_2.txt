Previous comments encouraged me to check it out when I appeared on traditional Chinese medicine, but it was very disappointing. The Valdez lobby is fantastic, but it does not get enough time for the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Pallet play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stuck. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego that characterizes Lee Tracy, who is at best a self-centered character, physically and verbally. Foolish. The "public" reactions are bad-minded and unbelievable, making the "Shinigans" seem like the contradictions of a bad writer. Which adds credibility to the personality of the Loeb Velez that he can take on. <br /> <br /> The "sting with lines" mentioned in another review should depend on the observer, since I did not even notice that there was an attempt being made.
