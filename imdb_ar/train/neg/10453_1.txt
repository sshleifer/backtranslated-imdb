This movie deserves more than one. But I give it a film because many of the fan boys who have been awarded have been awarded 10, resulting in a rating that will take it to the top 100 list. Seriously it's not big that's not so bad. It's a stupid cult classic with lots of fricken boys fan it silly. These are the species that may still laugh at the jokes of Chuck Norris and still say "I'm Rick James B. Chuck" no matter how old or annoying. I'm afraid to hear "I've been fed up with MFn snakes on this MFN" since months of fools trying to be funny. A crappy plot to behave nonsense and so on. Well, you love a bad movie, but you still have to recognize his bad film. <br /> <br /> Wait for Marines starring John Cena if you want to watch a real movie
