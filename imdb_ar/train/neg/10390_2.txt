I rented and watched this movie just to find out what it was all about. So here are my reactions to it. Easily see that this is a low budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this film revolves around the revenge of a woman for her rapists. If the concept is done correctly it can easily turn into a really provocative film. However, the film does not shock me or bother me at all. It just bored me. This film can be easily reduced to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes exist mainly to fill the time, such as landscape scenes and some of the scenes described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find rape scenes completely tame. I do not know if you have seen the cut or unpolished version, if there is already such a version. I have also found many holes in the plot already poorly written. Here is a list of my top thoughts. <br /> <br /> Why rapists do not rape Jennifer during the night when she goes out of her house to find out what the noise is. This will be a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> Why do not they just rape her, rather than delay some of the rapists and Jennifer's plight so long. It is likely to be more shocking and disturbing in this way. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and go back to her house. Perhaps to show that these rapists are really flags. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do dirty work properly, they should not send a cowardly guilty to do the job. <br /> <br /> Why did Jennifer not call the police when the rapists finally left? Which must be the first thing that pops into the minds of most people, especially for the person who is the author. <br /> <br /> Why did not these rapists smell a danger miles away when they saw that Jennifer was alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up. The tree and its trunk. ************************ Ends spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this The film is not without its advantages, Camille Keaton is wonderful and I listen to one of the most extreme strings I've heard recently when Matthew protested to go home and kill Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, I was not even c ^ m !!!
