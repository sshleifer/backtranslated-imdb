Anywhere near the original. It's a very accurate version that brings nothing new to the story. But the guidance is very bad. Poor Basinger - without good guidance. Baldwin is just a second league compared to McQueen. I watched it out of curiosity, being a great admirer of Beckenba, and got what I thought. Almost film B with rate representation and second representation. I was not disappointed, and I do not know what they were trying to do. This new version does not try to play original material, it's not a honor, it lacks a really good actor in its time. <br /> <br /> Remember a bad Xerox copy of the wonderful picture. This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself two hours or see the original (again :)))
