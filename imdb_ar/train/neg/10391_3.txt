I have watched Gator Bait movies, and this is exactly the same thing as those movies. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically avenges her wicked revenge on all of them. What distinguishes this film from those films (though not too far) is that sexual content has not been glorified. There is full front nudity several times throughout the film, but not for a second period it is exciting. Some rape scenes may seem somewhat broad, but this is only because the film tries to enhance the public's need to see this woman seeking revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak film, and has no other way to maintain interest than to manipulate our natural desire to see this woman avenge the attackers. "I'm spitting on your grave" is not a kind of film that you expect to give a serious moral, but I was happy to see it, because it contains a lot of violence practiced by the female, was not meant to fade T & A. <br /> <br /> B-movies are known for being nudity driven and out of sexual control of teenagers, and while I'm Spit On You, Grave is an unmistakable B movie and contains more than its share of nudity, nudity does not lead the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is the empty need to avenge a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary dropouts just as they were in the films of Gator Bait, and it seems that the biggest challenge facing the book is to find new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why the film can never be more. That B is meaningless because it does not offer a message of any kind, but instead satisfies the public's desire to see a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem this leaves is that we have to face sexual attacks. Strangely enough, the first half of the film is the part that contains the maximum nudity (though not too much), but it is by far the most painful to watch it. We were a little disappointed when we saw the woman retaliating because two of the deaths were impossible to the point that they were clearly impossible (it seems like a pure luck that the man in the lake finally felt an overwhelming desire to hug the engine on the boat and press the genitals against the fan, As the woman screams some final words on him and pulls the rope), but again, this film only satisfies the desire for revenge that filled us in the first half. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that this is all that the film means, because it ends literally at the moment the last person is killed. Women never live happily ever after, do not write their book, never leave and never return to this nightmare place; they are only in the boat and drive around the lake while the film simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what did you expect more? <br /> <br /> Oh, did you read the description line? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try to find any man who breaks or burns. You really look forward to these?
