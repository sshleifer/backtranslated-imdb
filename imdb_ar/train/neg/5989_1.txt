Wow I have paid Â£ 3.50 to go to see this movie in the cinema. I can not believe I'm wasting my time. Representation swings at best and raw special effects. Probarly Worst Scenario in History Some very embarrassing quotations I've ever heard in my life. I swear by God "I washed" better than this. Madonna should have won and Oscar compared to these men. An hour and a half of my life I want to return. Frankly people do not see this, even the little child will find this film an insult to their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more youthful, young theses here than the real dolls. Do not waste your time in this movie where you will live to regret it.
