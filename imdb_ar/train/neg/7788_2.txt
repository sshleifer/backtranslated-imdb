I have noticed how all other reviews of this film refer to how "healthy" and "entertaining" it is. These people need to get out of the house often. I do not know why they bombarded this piece of slow, indistinct fluff. Pat Bonn has no talent at all, and his deficit is only surpassed by his star, Pamela Austin, a former model. Another reason to ban the malicious practice of putting unqualified models on an audience is moving unexpectedly, Continued to this day). A good support team (Terry Thomas, Edward Everett Hortion, among others) is trying to make some effort to realize it, but to no avail. I noticed that two managers share credit, although "credit" is not the word that I will use (no "manager"). As for "health entertainment", there are many of these types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through it. Find one of those movies, skip this one.
