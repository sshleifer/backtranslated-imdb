If you've seen fewer movies, it might be great for you. If you've watched a lot of movies, this is a joke. The representation of real heroes portrayed very badly. Not to mention the existence of songs, there are a lot of memories of the past and, most importantly, stupid scenes are performed stupidly. New characters, a good direction, would do a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood heroes / championships, you can predict what will happen next. Do not feel sad when something happens. The feelings you see are awesome, mainly because we saw this actor in 1,000 other Indian films. It is supposed to be a realistic film, but it failed to appear. There are times when you wonder, you have thousands of army men full of soldiers moving and the Pakistanis are bombing them and not hitting them with their bombs. Are the pakis really bad at aiming or making the director look stupid? There were only a few characters that were working very well, but as far as the plot was concerned, the movement is poorly guided. This film could have been short if they took out songs, memories of the past, and stuck to that point.
