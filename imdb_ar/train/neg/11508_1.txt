All that Jay Ritchie has to reproduce Wertmuller is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw him, and I left about an hour in it. (I hope you have requested a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end is that I never took out a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat in this very unwanted piece that Madonna and Richie could think they made a good movie. The dialogue is funny, the representation is terrible and the only nice thing in this film is the scene. Richie took Lena's film and turned it into another Blue Lagoon movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will not be lost even in late night viewing on Cinemax. Time is so precious that you do not waste nonsense in this way.
