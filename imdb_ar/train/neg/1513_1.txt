The flock is not really a movie. It's a wishful movie, with a good actor. Not including Richard Gere, he did an excellent job, but when only one actor gave his character really, and the rest of the actors acted only ... The result was pathetic, just like this film. As you can see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you act. What the hell was Claire Daines doing in this? She is the most suitable actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film, looked far from the place, out of everything !! The only thing she did was ask dumb questions, like "Do you really think so?" , Making silly faces. I was embarrassed by acting, seriously, and I loved her ... It's kind of romantic movies, I do not know who she chose among all the actresses there .... LOL, seeing Avril Lavigne?! This made me really laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to feel disposed, this film will work for you! I hope to vote -5 ..
