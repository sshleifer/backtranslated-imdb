This film sucked pretty much. I am in the army and the soldiers portrayed in this film are appalled. If you are in the army and you see this movie, you will laugh and disturb the entire film because of the way you acted as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like a handful of ordinary people dressed in army uniforms not knowing what to do. It has been a fairly wonderful film, I have to say the least. There were a few scenes where they tried to make you jump. I recommend seeing him if you feel bored and want to see a violent film. It will also be a better film if not in the army. I would also like to say that I loved the first better than this.
