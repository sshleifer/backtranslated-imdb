I did not finish the film. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially negative. But I did, just because I stopped him because I could not see him anymore ... I was halfway there, and I only arrived there with my promise of something good that was just around the corner. This film is very cumbersome, so weak that I have already been insulted. I have not read a lot of other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other gay teenagers who have suffered it, but like me, I have passed "similar" verses, day dreams, issues, etc. Perhaps there were two moments when I felt that this film could go somewhere, where I felt it might have some meaning, or relative, but these hopes were dispelled at the moment when the next set of clumsy narratives appeared. I mean just look at the quotation marks on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear the scratching read, and the echo does not fade if you only read quotations, because it is just painful / silly / too stupid to be missed. The movie was given three stars, and these three stars went to the cinematographer who did a great job trying to turn the tired Archer's "concepts" into something to watch. Keep in mind that I was not the person who decided to include all the long shots of the TV clips ... other unnecessary clichés already done in films such as Corinne Gomo ... I think it is very appropriate that this film be shown for the first time in Sundance Because Archer had links in the festival through his volunteer work, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival where the Cliché draver is still heavy as a "foothold". No, it's not art, I'm afraid it's just an ordinary house. do not watch.
