I could not believe how terrible this film was; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I stand properly. All concerned must hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I realize that there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the text to that was so incompetent, innovative and puzzling that I was ever surprised at development or that Mrs. Keaton thought she could make a purse Silk from the ear of this implant. None of the characters had an atmosphere of credibility and was very unpopular. The acting seemed like an exercise in a beginner class - I stared in open horror through most of the question "What were they thinking?". Very sad because it has come to this. do not waste your time.
