Let this be a warning to anyone who wants to draw attention to himself in the media by associating his name with the name of a beloved and respected author, so as not to say the distinguished author, to draw attention to his home movies on DVD. <br /> <br /> Since he is so noisy in the sky by their makers who do not know the talent, they have really lied only to be revealed, finally, as incompetent in every section, Wells' fans and writers were after the blood of his author and director since It appears on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Many good points have been recorded by other users' comments on this page. Especially those related to using this as an educational tool for film school students, because this "film" does not even use the basic rules of scripting, editing, continuity, and trend throughout its entire 3 hours operation. It is possible that the director will appear for the shooting. Sure, no one knew even remotely what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Continuing the continuous thread evolves in this IMDb page which should at least provide the observers with this hidden leadership with a little laugh of $ 9.00 on their expenses. <br /> <br /> Many promise. Certainly nothing was delivered. Except "Monty Python meets" World War "with all the humor that has been removed. <br /> <br /> An unmanageable trash can is incredible. <br /> <br /> There are real independent filmmakers there for people Who are trying to actually work according to high standards instead of clapping their gums about how important their film is. <br /> <br /> People can do worse than watching British director Jake West "Evil aliens" for example.
