*** One out of ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if so, it gets the Holy Mother of Mary God was this bad. I mean, she gave her every reasonable accommodation because it was a direct film, but she let me down at every turn. Like many other B films, the basic script was fit and filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a shame to put the name of the Holy Feast on this failure. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds some of the shower bags that host her annual Halloween fundraiser when a demonic spellbook emerges from nowhere. The boys are thrown into hell. Well, this is the idea anyway, but instead, most of the movie is dedicated to showing the relationship of this Euphrates boy, abounding with an ugly lesbian sub-plot. Very little actual story dedicated to Halloween or a mysterious spelling book. It is outrageous that filmmakers thought they could escape this kind of drop. <br /> <br /> The film mainly revolves around the relationships between the two boys. This is not what the film described. I am tempted to track down producers and at least threaten them with bodily harm. Representation is as bad as it happens, it is terrible! Funny scenario unintentionally. Cinematography is just lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. In fact, this film makes film productions SyFy channel similar to masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I felt the last half hour of the film as if the makers of the film realized that they did not produce the soap opera and had to throw it in the sequence of terror. The book spells evil in the end and turns everyone in the haunted house into a person in their clothes. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Wonderful! I mean wow! This was a non-encoded disaster.
