I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. I remember that he really sucked. The plot was meaningless. I hated the fox who became a friend of Casper. Was very stupid! Casper cried if he could not find a friend. So what? throw it away! The only good part I do not want to seem spiritual was when the fox was shot dead and eventually died. I laughed my head in recovery because this cartoon sucked so much. Bad news is a fox that resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he had died. I think I gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they were offering it for free in the mall. If you have a child do not let them watch this. They may agree with me that they suck.
