This is the perfect example of something very bad ... So, can I recommend anyone to watch it? Well, I was committed to the fact that he was in intense competition (I still can not believe he won) .. I just stayed until the end because the director was there to get the Q & A section ... but this was also nothing interesting .. how about it ? Well, the first half (worth watching) presents three characters: a prostitute, a musician and some kind of official ... the first lie about their profession ... but the third is the actual liar .. the second half (do something else ... do not destroy a good evening) The old ones and the light drink. But maybe you'll see it quite differently ... The jerky jury (were they drinking vodka?)
