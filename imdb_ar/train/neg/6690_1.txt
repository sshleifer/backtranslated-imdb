I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not near a low enough level. Frankly, I could not determine the kind of film that this film was to watch, and if it was a comedy, it was completely lost. The plot was absent and the acting was awful. My friends and I were able to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and soon we asked the video store to bring it back. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are deliberately trying to watch the worst movies at all. I honestly do not know how this film lasted for more than a day in the theaters. Moreover, I can not understand why anyone wants to watch it, considering that it is not just an interesting title but also the absence of famous actors / actors in the film . This review is not a joke and I honestly believe that this film is probably the worst film ever. It is certainly the worst film I have ever faced.
