Stewart Keane (Gabriel Byrne, Vanity Fair) is touring with his fishing companions in Jendapine, Australia for a weekend of rest, relaxation and relaxation. But when Stuart discovers the body of an indigenous woman floating in the river, things seem to have turned out to be worse. The biggest casualty on the weekend is logical for men. They do not climb out of the valley, and instead end the weekend with some great catch. Then they go out and tell about the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the lives of men are rapidly turning into chaos. Local media are fighting them, accusing them of prejudices of indigenous peoples. Stewart Claire's wife (Laura Lenny, Emily Rose's divorce) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and friends have done, but she has to fight through her mental illness. <br /> <br /> The middle of all this chaos. Is the life that this young woman, now a media spectacle, was put on the morgue board. Her murder and subsequent dumping in the water is symbolic of what lies below the city of Jendabeen: the division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand what is going on are two young children: Stuart's son and Claire, who is led by an Asian half-breed who killed his mother just a few years ago. The girl lives with her grandparents and tries to leave her mother in the best possible way, and it seems that the discovery of a new body ?? Strange enough ?? A way to accomplish this (again, the mainstream of Jindabyne is overcome). <br /> <br /> Everyone in this town in Jindabyne feels what lies beneath his surface, but none of them is ready to dive into the mysterious waters and look around (see the symbol here when a nearby lake is said to be used for entertainment and swimming contains the ancient city of Jindabyne Under its surface). Nothing, that is, until Claire forces them to do so. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting if it is too complicated. There are a lot of story lines that need to be explored and they do not accomplish; a lot of loose topics. The acting was fine, but the filming was terrible. Volatile cameras, granular or dark shots, and little generalization are detrimental to overall production. <br /> <br /> Enjoy iconic movies, where NORTHFORK is one of my favorite movies in this context. But Jindabyne needed to peak her head above the turbid waters so she could see her own problems, which did not happen simply.
