This is a terrible production for Bartleby, although it is not, as the other reviewer said because it "can not be solved", but because this version does not preserve the spirit of the book. Tells the story, almost painful. When I see it, I can flip the pages in my book and follow them, which is not much fun when dealing with an adjustment. Instead, see the 2001 version of Bartleby that displays Crispin Glover. This version, though humorous, offers new details of the film while preserving the spirit of the novel. The important thing is spirit, not details about things like setup, character names, fashion. The difference between these cinematic versions is like night and day, boring and fun. This version is a lesson for what can happen if the adaptation is treated poorly, painfully, mind awesomeness.
