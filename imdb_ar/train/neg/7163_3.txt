<br /> <br /> When you finish watching "Coma" or "Eternal" or whatever producers call this movie, I wondered, "Of all the bad movies I've seen, can not I see at least one that was amusing? "Even if the film is not good in terms of acting, directing, writing or what you have, it can be at least fun and therefore worth it. But this is not only a bad film, it's very boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves very slowly, with little tension. At least, in an attempt to entertain the low edges, the characters' deaths could have been cold and / or glorious, but the creators of this ditch also failed in this circle. <br /> <br /> What is this movie happening? Almost nothing, unless you get the entertainment of watching Christopher and Kevin, who can be glamorous, did not make much effort in his actions to the extent that he was in a self-parody (why did he decide to do the film anyway?). I gave this movie 3/10, because God helped us, there were already worse movies made before.
