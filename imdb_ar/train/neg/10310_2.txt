Lorenzo Lamas is a CIA agent who captures some of Alexa's strange beauty and abducts her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a range of representation credibility for the uneducated group. I must admit that I am not a lover of Lorenzo Lamas, or his films. It's stinky. But compared to O.J Simpson and the wife of Lamas Zombie of Kinmont, Lamas looks like Ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I've only seen the CIA because of renewed interest in O.J Simpson's experience. You see, if your parents have extra cables and channels, you will not be able to escape this movie. In 1994, you could go to the Amish community, and it was normal to play this game on their mobile TV. The film itself is a collection of lame action sequences and will be intriguing although the shocking value of O.J Simpson jumps after the fireballs and the exchange will be one of the fans offering some unintended humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this classic camp complete? <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
