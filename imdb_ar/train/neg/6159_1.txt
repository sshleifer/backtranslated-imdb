Why do all those who watched this film feel that they have a responsibility to tell us whether they are good or not? This point is quite unimportant for any argument being made against this total dog of the film. <br /> <br /> I think that sports films are divided into two categories; well-made films about the human spirit and contests, and "by the sword." <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie has not decided honestly what it wants to be, an impressive drama to try to be the best you have in life, charging competitive motivation or flick martial arts. In the end, none of these masked people did enough to make me deal with any of them. <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm also a fencing coach (now I'm officially bad like the rest). But putting a bad fence in a movie does not make it bad automatically. I mean look at Star Wars (4-6 episodes, good movies, bad fence). I liked those movies but when you put bad sports in a bad movie for some reason, people think that only hardcore people think it's a lame effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comments on the issue of smaller fencing. . This is just a bad film. In the end, this film has nothing to do with fans of fencing, movie buff, or anyone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I see a film and find myself forced to think, "Man, I wish I were watching the great ducks." I know it's time to go over the argument with the theater director to get my money back and see if anyone in the lobby will give me One way or another two hours of my life.
