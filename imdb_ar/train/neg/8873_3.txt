Has anyone stopped recognizing the kind of film he produced here? Now let's become a former Marine officer subject to a group of children at Cadet School so should this be a family comedy? Error . This is just a terrible comedy aimed at teenagers who suffer from many moments of bad taste. Maybe it was possible to see them in a very stupid way at this point, but I found the sound of Damon and Ians incredibly troublesome. Does he speak so in real life? If he did, he would have my sympathy, but he would not get any of my money from watching his movies
