I was very disappointed to see this film at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. I attended this festival more than five years ago, and I have certainly seen some bad films at times. However, "First Bite" reached a new level in the movie. Although taking pictures in beautiful places, with wonderful wonderful dining from time to time, the film distorts a large number of intrigue intrigues and simplified characters so I was actually begging to come to an end. <br /> <br /> The main actor, David La Hay, failed to show any development of the characters during the film, filming a top chef from start to finish. Additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were developed very poorly and were not fully contained in any context the film had been presented to this point. <br /> <br /> The subject of Sufism was used as a poor attempt to hide a film that does nothing and does not go anywhere and disappoints completely.
