Max had a V-8 engine, with Trace (the last and only fireball champion) on a jet engine at the back of his car, allowing him to make unintended spiritual objects during his missiles around the barren, barren land in the middle of the road. Be surprised that Mad Max 2 (also known as The Road Warrior) is sliced ​​and split again as a new film albeit poorly filmed with bad actors and bad sharp work. <br /> <br /> Why was WoF appointed in the wasteland after the horrific? Simple, warrior was the way! In fact you can answer any questions before: it was this way in Road Warrior! With the exception of the cast-off actors from The Original Machine of the 1960s, which had a great appearance to give the public some non-vehicle action to chew for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Typically the 1980s fashion, all cars driven by bad guys who collide or collide a bit explode in a huge explosion. In the end, all the car chases will occur near the sides of the comfortable cliff and the cars will be undisputed. Along with this film ride in the 1980s, the loathing of women is rampant in this type of cheap film. In general, I waited for the rocket-fired Trace to speed up and shoot, so there would be another shot of him, thrusting his face out as if it were supposed to be harsh, which would explode more because of his grasp. The poorly designed work, along with bad acting, makes this movie a real drown. So that the value of unintended humor was able to wear fine clothes. <br /> <br /> Rats: Terrorism s by Bruno Matte is superior. This in itself says a lot! Through this number, the 2020 Gladiators are a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. Road Warrior assassin who does not have enough cheese worker to make the movie famous. <br /> <br />
