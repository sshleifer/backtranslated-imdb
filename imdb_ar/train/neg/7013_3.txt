Unfortunately, this movie, 54 was a pathetic attempt of the real story "Studio 54". The only thing that was good in the picture was "Mike Myers" who was happy to see it. "Neve Campbell", although her role was a bit was unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that this film lacked the good performance of the actors, except for one, and that turning the real story was a desperate attempt at a good film.
