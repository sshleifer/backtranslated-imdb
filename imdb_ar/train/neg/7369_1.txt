I had a feeling that after the "immersion", this would not be the best ... I was right. You should look for champagne money, and do not care about the final product ... His voice over and over again by a stranger does not look like him; editing - well - just a top amateur score. It's nothing more than a B or C movie with enough money to hire talented photographers and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problems appear in the prism - production (... voice dubbing, etc.) is very bad, because the plot is actually quite good for the SG flick. <br /> <br /> I will not hire another GST from SG, unless he sends me an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - jimbo
