Think of this movie as a Saturday morning work from previous times. Even small tykes will find this hard to satisfy because it works like molasses! I can not quite understand how awesome God is to do something typical and uninterested, especially in the clothing section! Too many warrior wizard films have used the same old scheme several times, but this is very rare given its appeal to young fans. Who would have allowed the world to throw the mermaid naked in the first place? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, Here's another great gem for the 1999 TV season!
