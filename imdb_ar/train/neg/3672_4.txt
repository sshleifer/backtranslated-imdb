I watched the entire film admitting the participation of William Hurt, Natasha McLaughon and Desiree Nusbosch. I'm glad because I had no idea of ​​Peter Wheeler's existence. At the end of the film I said "Was Peter Wheeler?" Glory to Mr. Wheeler for outstanding performance. Wheeler played a key character, and his performance was so good that I did not know him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the shows, except for Nosbusch and Weller's shows. , Were subpar. The scene and setting were interesting, and Wheeler was wonderful. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, out of 10 possible.
