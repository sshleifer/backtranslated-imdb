This film was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie is named something else, no one will notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange because I can not see this point. the prequel and sequel only lets say no meaning, so do not match. Maybe I'm naive but not folder 1 and folder 2 means to match. <br /> <br /> The carlito was in jail at 1st and originally died, and in his barracks live and not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was fine, but they had to change some actors and some story lines and movie name, and it would have been a good film. <br /> <br /> I expected it to end as the other started. <br /> <br /> If someone has an opinion on this publication, please.
