Plot Summary: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagoner, the man who built the Victoria tunnel, was killed along with his wife by his colleagues. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. Twenty-five years later, Chad, a Karate trainer in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, joined forces to avenge her parents and demand the right of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time. Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Letic have worked together, having previously been "the heart of the lion." This is also the first three films that show Van Domme a double role ("maximum risk" and "refined" are the other). The plot is a very simplified story about the story of revenge, and the only advantage in the film is Van Damme's performance as two very different people? Rich Baby Brecy & Raw Drop, the cigar knocks the strong guy. Apparently, Van Damme does not do very well in any of the roles, although his assumption of Alex is somewhat amusing. It is puzzling that the brothers mistake each other, wearing different clothes and carrying different hairstyles. Polo Young makes followers very worthy of the bad guys.
