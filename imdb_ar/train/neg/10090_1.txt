This movie is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". why? Because the only thing retrieved about this was the good laugh I got from the tremendous irony of the irrational and sensational plot of horrible deeds. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered questions in this film ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are "sponsors" of the zombie and what is its purpose? Since when does 6 people constitute a "nation" of the zombie? Did Mascara smear the black eye "scary" to anyone anywhere? Until he is two years old? <br /> <br /> Finally, why is this film made at all? why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> They actually made this comment on the request channel after the movie summary: Sorry for this movie in advance "LOL. At least they had the wisdom to do so much!
