The TV guide describes this film as a mystery. It is a mystery to me how a culture that can produce such complex complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians can produce a single film that rises above the level of trash that this film represents. This is Bollywood at its best / worst, I honestly can not tell the difference. Sweet cliches and nausea on every level, story, positions, dialogue, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you should be recently enjoying it. I saw it to satisfy my curiosity, but there were times when I had to get away from it, because I could not take it anymore. The only quality to redeem the film is the wonderful beauty of the leading actors. <br /> <br />
