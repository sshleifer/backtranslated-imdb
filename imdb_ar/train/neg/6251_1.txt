I was able to get into the first 20 minutes of this low-budget movie. The most obvious absurdity is that while all American prisoners in a camp for prisoners of war in North Korea are supposed to suffer from severe deprivation of food and medicine, without batting, shivering in lively gardens, sleeping on bare floors, They are always able to play sport full of hair. With the exception of a well-dressed Harry Morgan as a military leader, acting and filming is simply shocking. Ronald Reagan does not seem to be committed to portraying one character and instead creating a mix of schizophrenia between previous roles. There may have been tolerance with a representative from the Caucasus depicting North Korean camp officers, but when the Russian officers who serve as advisers to the Koreans are supposed to be maneuvering around wearing a fully restored Nazi uniform with jodhpurs and jackboots (speaking clearly to the uniforms of World War II) Gen. Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six kinds of ridiculous. Do not waste your time in this one.
