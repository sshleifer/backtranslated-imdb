"Trigger Man" is certainly the most boring and most ridiculous film I have ever seen. My aunt's videos are more exciting. <br /> <br /> The actors appear to have been recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent for acting in a convincing way. <br /> <br /> They walk, walk and walk in the forest. There is plenty of walking in all three parts of the Lord of the Rings together. After the first hour, I started reading the Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Horrible. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time and money. I give this movie 0 star out of 10, because this is not possible, I must give one star.
