The screenplay is so stupid that it hurts me to waste two hours of my life and never go back (where I heard this before). Representation is not so. Things change often enough to keep you waiting and waiting for something hideous to happen. However, there is nothing original in this movie. Although the first Cube was a horror film, it did not make much sense at the end, but the zero cube has dealt with it and is trying to re-narrate the same story completely, but this time it raises an odious point of trying to clarify the spoon for each Details not answered by the first film. The comic thing is that the director recycles the fine scenes of the first film which was a bit odd and tries to explain it. But the scenes are copied only, there is no cohesion at all. This scenario is useless. I can imagine it was written by a 15 year old person with a baseball cap and a set of beers for a separate project. The best part is in the end, the man paralyzes the "good" wonders, and becomes the underdeveloped colleague in the first film, and sees him when he finds him ("This room is green ..") in 1997 Cube Goodie gooodie, clap applause, what a twist. First of all, what if you have not seen the first one, this is unthinkable that you are the director Natit. Oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to determine the coordinates of x, y, z for the room (cube 1997), this time is 3 characters, each one gives one of the 26 possible coordinate value. Doh. Except now the permutation does not make any sense anymore .. so it leaves the characters disappear before anyone can use them .. I want to recover my money. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write this because there are a lot of bad or inconsistent or stupid thoughts in this film. Directors / writers should be asked to own some talent.
