How could the comments like those that were addressed by high school girls so make them on this site, this was the dumbest movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how could any idiot sit there and say that just because the movie makes you jump is a good movie, The most stupid things I've heard about before, I can sneak behind you and go to Boo and make you jump, but that does not mean I'm qualified to write or direct the film, let alone "tie everything together in the end" is not a good reason to receive the film well. What kind of movies would be if they did not tie everything together, I think that would make it half a movie, not a full movie. So, complimented by this stupid girl on the finish of the film, I like the way that the young media today and the production companies impart to this high level. No wonder the political system in this country can get away from anything it wants. We have idiots like that in our country. What would happen if this girl actually ended up leading something someday, and that's scary. Enjoy life and watch a real movie at some point, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something like that, and do not comment on being "boring" after you see it, just use what the little brain gave you to analyze. It's a little bit.
