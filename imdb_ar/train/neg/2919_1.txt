Geez, as a gay man living in New York City, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the "gay culture" filmed in this film - and I am so happy !!! Was this movie broadcast on television all over the United States there was a big backlash against homosexuals and I can not say I blame them. People in this film do not represent the average American gay or even the American average Trandgender, what they represent is a pure and total nightmare. The inclusion of underage figures is horrifying, and the clear (non-white) racism is blatant and unobtrusive - society can not be blamed on the people who chose drugs, unemployment and the rejection of education by the "actors" in the film - the actions of these people are not acts of despair; Is a rejection of anything that is like personal ambition and the desire to make something of the self.
