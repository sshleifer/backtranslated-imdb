It was a good film, and I really enjoyed it. But the end is very sudden !! There is no closure at all and leaves tons of loose limbs. What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Are they connecting with Grant? Will you come in the next semester? What about Angela? It is clear that Holly's performance will lead Angela to stop connecting some of the pegs, but nothing shows how they interact. There is a lot in the air which is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if they are trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is an awesome ending and I think they make the movie a really joke. I was very disappointed.
