At one point when she looked interesting, she never got there. <br /> <br /> People move from one point to another, to no avail (if there was one that was too boring). There was no action, suspense or horror and the characters were heartless, so there was no interest in what happened to them. <br /> <br /> The movie together was very boring. <br /> <br /> Give it 3/10. <br /> <br /> I liked that it was not so fragile in the camera, and if there was music, it did not bother me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrible.
