The summary summarizes everything. This is anywhere near as good as the original. With a script co-written by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he was also writing foreigners). Cameron wrote most of the proceedings and wrote political aspects by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Slay was in the best physical condition because he was making it and Rocky 4 was looking great or lifting it. To steroids, depending on your point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who is asked to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon. In the end, he agrees and moves to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier, playing a suit in Washington trying to pass himself as former forces to appease Rambo. <br /> <br /> The task is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen because the camp he was examining was somewhere he had been previously imprisoned. He was told that it was not a rescue mission and that he was there to take photos for reconnection only. <br /> <br /> After a bad bid for parachutes from an airplane loses most of his group, meets his contact (who turns into being a nice woman) and travels to the river with the pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He found that there were still prisoners and rescued one of them. With three of the Vietnamese army fleeing on board their river boat, they are betrayed by pirates but Rambo kills them all and they have to continue to the point of capture on foot after the boat was hit and blown up with Rambo almost on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo was betrayed again and abandoned while Napier ordered the rescue helicopter. It is clear that with the return of Trotman to the base to overcome it was not expected to find survivors. <br /> <br /> Stephen Berkov emerged as Russian Colonel Spitznats and Rambo was tortured, eventually escaping from there only to be pursued. Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Many of them were killed, and finally Rambo steals a helicopter and saves most prisoners to return to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the desire to kill Napier to give up but destroys the operations center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak end while Rambo walks towards the sunset as a free man.
