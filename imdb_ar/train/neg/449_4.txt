I will admit that I only saw a few episodes, but each one looked quite different from the next. It seems that after the first season, producers decided to re-equip the entire display, drop the characters, enter new characters, and rewrite the entire dynamic presentation. <br /> <br /> Since you may have already thought, the show revolves around an unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Baines) who moves with her tall sister Valerie (Jenny Garth) in New York City. Hypothesis: a strange couple + fish outside the water + a high sculptor. <br /> <br /> While I miss the comic series of days, this show unfortunately lacks a funny sign again and again, which is sad because they have some decent talent. <br /> <br /> In addition to everything, they insisted on changing the offer (Val was living with one of the usual teams in a single season, and suddenly disappeared, when she opened a bakery? What?) When things change radically, * Know that it is bad. I mean, completely new collections, deleted characters and two new program systems! <br /> <br /> In a side note (this is just a snatch), I know this is a TV show and not real at all, but Fall and Holly end up living in a huge duplex (there are ladders) with a balcony ... in Manhattan! are you serious!?
