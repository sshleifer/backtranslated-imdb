I saw this movie a long time ago ... Fortunately, it was free. I must be one of twenty people who have seen this film in the theater. I do not remember a whole bunch of it, but I remember being incredibly bored, the plot was not meaningful, and when I came out of the theater, the only thing I could say was at least now that I knew what the worst film I've ever had be seen. I have been incredibly upset about one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun is low enough to survive, why can not they be converted to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweating? How stupid do they think we are?
