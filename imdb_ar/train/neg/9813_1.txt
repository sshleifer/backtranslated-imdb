... I have seen some of them bad. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say about this film. Poor representation of Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah does a good job, but there is nothing close to being able to save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback of this film is that the plot is too weak - although it is based on a good hypothesis - that the writer resorted to the "stupid heroine trick" to create an intriguing thrill. When every Daryl Hannah has to do is hide, run out before her pursuers. The hospital scene is ridiculous. Without revealing much of what can be obtained in order to plot, I think it would be difficult for a small bloody woman to carry a pregnant woman from the hospital without noticing it. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save yourself some time and pick another click.
