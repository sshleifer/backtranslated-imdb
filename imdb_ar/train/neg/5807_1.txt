Do not care about this film, it's bad when judged on its own merits, but compared with the original version of 1972 (it's a classic version), it's very bad. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 film was bad compared to the book. This is ridiculous, films should never be judged against the books from which they are taken. They are completely different forms (as if it is necessary to point out but it seems to be so). If you use these criteria for all movies, you will catch "2001" as well as "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
