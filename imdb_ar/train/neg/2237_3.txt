I got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and maybe it continues ..) until the DVD cover looks cheap, as with the entire movie. Gunshots and battles with late sound effects, some of the worst actors I have ever seen, a very simple plot, made me laugh until my stomach was blurred! With very few financial resources, I must admit that they look pretty pretty. Since he is a film, he was one of 13 out of every ten lascivious gangsters that nobody would expect. If: you are tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
