As usual, on IMDb, going by a majority vote rather than a "weighted average" is a far more indicator of the value of entertainment in the film. In this case, the majority give it "one". How are they right! To start the review, I will first acknowledge that I am completely ignorant of why this movie was named Alien Intruder. It has an area and even an "alien" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long term. At least, there is no basis for a conspiracy or an actual decision that I can do anywhere. <br /> <br /> There are very few horrific scenes (in terms of both fonts, timing and the way they speak), so much beyond the strange feeling you feel when watching really bad movies. I have no idea about this part near the beginning where Bunny Buns seems to bother me something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" only includes space from space known as G-Spot, sorry, the G-sector ... and the virtual reality program are infected with a type of alien virus (?). I think it's strange because Ariel's normal image seems negative. For most of the film, we see people shooting with space weapons, falling from the upper rooms, seemingly endless, close-up shots of "Where's Ariel?" , "Ariel can not be found" (meaningless because most of the other clips include interacting with Ariel, anyway - whatever) on the computer screen. Commander Skyler (Billy De), sits and watches every fantasy of VR software ruled in the hope of finding this alien virus and becoming the one with it ... ?? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy De Williams studied a few sessions on "How to act in a state of despair" before filming this. We know that because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down on his face and looks sad. <br /> <br /> The scene of docking with the nose of one ship at the back of the other was almost the least satisfied, providing laughter as well as the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship because it is circling in a circle, looks like a lost lego experience. <br /> <br /> Everybody seems to die in this movie, so why bother? So VR females kill, as if it meant to mean nothing (especially since everyone dies anyway) ... obscene. <br /> <br /> Because of the money he saved on groceries, I will not flounder about wanting to recover my money that you paid for this DVD. The dollar you saved on a bag of vanilla chips paid for the time of this reviewer. <br /> <br /> I will just add that the same story, at least as a novel, with the addition of more details, can probably be very interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
