This film is really something of eggs balls, good in some parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main mistake in that was his inability to attract viewer interest in characters and plot. I've sat there because I'm interested in Rock and Roll and the dynamics of the difference, but if I'm going to evaluate it on the merits of the film as a sponsor, I have to give it a thumbs-up, some caveats: Jason Bear is good in John Levine's part and he's quite convincing as a rock singer. The narrative of his childhood trauma is unclear, although we have got hints in Levin's good behavior relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately strange to the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using a theater character to solve internal conflicts is an interesting idea, although it is not new and is not fully explored as a theme in this film. John Lennon's hints were annoying, but I admit I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Levian and his band reminded me of more of the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derived from them. Another frustrating thing about the film is how it opened up with some interesting - though midbrow and high school level - philosophical reflections of the leading character, but he left the threads of his thinking there, just to pick them up again in the middle of the film for a very short time, "Before God, there was music" (I had already seen Tia Maria's announcement in the 1990s, "Before the time, there was Tia Maria" - that's what spread anyway); it seems to be a foolish conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how to reach But has the right to do so. Fortunately, his vocalist and friend, played by Dominique Monaghan, can easily admit that he is wrong when he responds, "You do not know that." <br /> <br /> In general, the limited strengths in the direction and the plot can go either in future projects or into meaningless nonsense or an interesting and more mature perspective.
