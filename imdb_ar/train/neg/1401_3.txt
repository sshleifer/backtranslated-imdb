Someone mentioned editing. This has been loosely edited and what has become rather curious has become an incomprehensible mess. For starters, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiences. Why are these people the best choices for the type of experience they're involved in? What exactly do they experience? Clearly, there is a major plan being exploited by some agencies. The representation is very bad. Everyone is passionate. Everyone keeps secrets. Recall frequently that if it is not for the money, they will hang it. There is a misguided minister who publishes the Bible. Repeatedly. But, again, the biggest suspension is the lack of a play yard for representatives. There are some really cheesy items. Those are small rooms and those are lounges. Horrible background (had a background?). It was fun, but it did not seem to go anywhere.
