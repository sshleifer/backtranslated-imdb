Steve Buscemi, an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a divided apartment in New York City and relies on his mother to help get the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Belles) who may be married or not married but Aldolfo would love to star in his film. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise to fund his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he got it. That is, so Joe takes Al in an adventure to steal a Porsche car for part of the financial support. Will the film be made before the duo is completely without a spine? Will Angelica star in the film? This, in the opinion of this viewer, is a terrible film. The script is lousy, with a plot wandering around the Nile. Bells practically fights all of her lines and Buscemi, though beloved, is not described. There is a great deal of hateful material and repulsive personalities to take off. Finally, production values ​​are also very weak, making the film appear to be second only to all times. If you have time on your hands, it's still good not to play this movie. But, if you are homeopathic bard of punishment, go ahead and watch the darn thing. Pils looks pretty, after all.
