When the theater staff finds an old reel of the film, they decide to show it in the middle of the night to view the night of the dead, assuming it is an old reel. Unfortunately, it is in fact an old experience of controlling the Nazi mind, turning the audience into a crowd of zombies who do not care. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the hatred of this film. It's a low-budget independent production with lots of camps, but it's not worth "1.1" here on IMDb. It's just a lot of fun. It is clear that filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and that they have created an amusing appreciation of them filled with references and honors for a variety of them. She has a sense of things like Night of the Dead Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, and many other things. <br /> <br /> I like to explain how zombie though he is really hypnotized to think they are zombies, but they actually have the physical qualities of unbelievable dead, but I appreciate the efforts the book has made to explain it. The bad effects were appropriate for the budget, the acting was fine, and the story was amusing. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
