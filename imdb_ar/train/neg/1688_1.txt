Jie, what a crappy movie this was! I can not understand what people find very frightening about "hatred". The director plays one trick (I had to admit one of the good things, which was resurrected in a very flamboyant way) and then repeats it to the rest of the film again and again. As a result, I was amazed several times in the first quarter of the film, but once I knew the exercises, I practically left the sleep because the Grudge became more predictable in the minute. In conclusion, I can say that there are much better films in this genre at first, and that the so-called "The Ring" was more terrifying and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
