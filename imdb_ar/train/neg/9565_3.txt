I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst film I've ever seen, taking moments or two good moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent film I have ever seen. No one ever gave the same ground device without my guess 10 minutes ago. There was no accuracy in anything the film did, and there was no clear intelligence behind the scenes. The intent of each line was spoken or written so clearly that it was impossible to "enter" the film. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the terribly studied plot line, and the eroded attempts to restore the audience, more often than I found myself enjoying the film.
