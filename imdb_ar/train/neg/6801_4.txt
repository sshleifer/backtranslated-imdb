First, I will not tell you why I hired this movie, because I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is very much like any film I saw where an airplane was hijacked. There is of course an important person on board, looking for a hijacker for revenge. The sad thing is that some ways to stop the hijackers have already been used in other films. Have we already become so non-indigenous? <br /> <br /> Although Ice-T (which inexplicably makes painful attempts at ACTING while not busy putting "c" in front of the rap) glorifies the film in the film, in fact, the lesser stars of Kim Ooga Amazing as a hostess is surprised by the five hijackers, which naturally return to haunt them. For the rest of the cast, the only person I could identify was Steve Heitner, better known as Kenny Banya of Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave my favorite part of the film, when I used a hijacker around Sterling from PLASTIQUE to blow the door lock ... fantastic. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> Text - Awful. It came to the point where I could say something, felt like it would be a stupid comment, and would be the next line in the film. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects ... the only thing unique about this film is that I wasted the cost of electricity to operate the TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> The title - the DID movie happens in the air. But due to the lesser performance of the stars, Rage was the only film in the performance of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood until you pick a movie, just because it's bad. Please save yourself, do not choose this.
