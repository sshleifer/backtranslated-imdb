I found myself very trapped in this film, at least in the beginning, and whatever balance I give to this film, is Lacy Shapert, it was wonderful !! But that's where it ends. I seem to be very good at knowing who the killer is, and I admire him when the film can make me completely puzzled, but I feel outside and out of lying. They drive you all the time in one direction, and suddenly I decide to go in a completely different direction at the end, No blow at all, and this is not misleading about bad writing and planning, no one ever thought! <br /> <br /> I felt it would have been much better if they had held onto the plot that led you to it, and apparently did not answer anything, why Jane (Maria) burned the professor's house. <br /> <br /> It is very unfortunate. I also felt it started as a relatively good film.
