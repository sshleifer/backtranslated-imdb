... It's better not to see this movie. They completely destroyed the exhibition hypothesis. In the film the stupid duke boys, Daisy Tramia, evil Rusko, Boss Hogg Capable, Uncle Jesse is a criminal ... Just a true cotter and flash for the original characters. At least Enos is fairly close. <br /> <br /> At some point, they open the doors to enter General Lee - nuff said. <br /> <br /> The original show may not be a great TV, but it was entertaining and logical characters. This movie like Dumb & Dumber meets Simple Life.
