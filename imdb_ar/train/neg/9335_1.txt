The reason why this movie is bad is that it is written very badly, and that is the reason for the fictional novelist Robert James Waler, author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is completely vulgar and the dialogue is wooden and unbelievable. A couple of failed - a frozen American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history ashamed of him - is swept by a powerful and self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the killer, they leave the helpless partner of the killer, Bad, he sees it more clearly than anyone else. Nothing can help this film succeed, not even the distinctive face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the attractive line of Giovanna Zacarias like Luz, nor even the strong performance of Keitel as a CIA specialist charged with tracking the killer. A serious waste of time.
