Con Waters is a singer and presenter. In the early 1990s, he tried his hand on films too. But this junk piece of junk ended his acting career forever. He also ended the performance of the Dutch actress Nada Van Ney, who became a football wife as a television presenter and program maker. I've already seen this in a theater (almost empty) because I was a fan of the Waters, Cluzo. I am very sorry to spend money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's poorly implemented in every possible way. Some people think it is very bad. I'm not one of them. I found it just a waste of time and money.
