Dear, Jerry may be the king of the undisputed talks, but the ball game films are quite different, and is on his way out of his patrol. The script for this film is so poor that it is necessary to believe and grieve to see mysterious actors such as Michael Dodikoff (The Eighties of the film 'B'movie king') and Michael Jay White (the latest movie in Sci Fi) Life of the Games' William McNamara (who shares only half of the funny position in the entire film!) Descends to this minimum to work. If you're a fan of Jerry, you have to stick to his TV show because this is a complete waste for an hour and a half. After I finished sitting during this, I was able to catch half an hour from the Rocky 5 movie on TV, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece compared, and I think this says more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
