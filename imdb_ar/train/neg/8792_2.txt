This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories were combined into one film. It is clear that other reviewers also chose this because there are several references to "Part I" and "Part II". How can you have any development of characters or a deep plot when characters and story are displayed for such a short time? I was enjoying the first part until I suddenly stopped (did not "end", stopped only in what seemed to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an unbelievable and unbelievable second part that seemed to focus on a girl rearranging and cleaning the guy's apartment! Give Wong Kar Wai a decent text to work with!
