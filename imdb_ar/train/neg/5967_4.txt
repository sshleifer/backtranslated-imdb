Just think, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to work as "clerks". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to create this glorious music video? A team that is not known in practice, two or three groups, there are no special effects that I can see ... I know, it must have been spent on this scenario, which is full of experience, and economic, full of tension. Shoot, this package tape must be costing package. Anyway, I think Jerry Brockheimer will not get him dead and he's producing less. I am surprised that he did not blow anything up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not a bad film I think. It seems that the female has some good chemistry and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It seems unfortunate that this modest project could have been produced for $ 5 million without any loss of production, and another 6 films worth $ 5 million could have been produced.
