Is there anything worse than a comedy that lacks humor? The answer is yes; one fails to generate any interest during the image. The premise is not too bad - a man in front of a na√Øve illegal act - but this is a Butel pot with a script and a weak script that just does not work. <br /> <br /> Was this "good" in 1942? Difficult to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains many well-known faces from the 1930s and 1940s, such as Warren Heimer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always consider Richard Cromwell to be the weak guy who killed Gary Cooper in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer" So I did not calculate it). <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this and get a rating of 3 - if you have an option, get the root channel.
