I did not think the French might make a bad film, but I was very wrong. As has been said before, this film mainly uses a personal title as a starting point; it has a picture of her life and a person with little or no relationship with Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is awful - tonnage, simplistic, and inert - and rewriting the unusually offensive facts even in a genre that often makes its living by distorting history rather than re-listing it. Along with the design of a fairly decent collection, physical charm Valentina Serve is the primary asset of this film, and it is clear from the beginning that filmmakers were also aware of this; do not waste any time reconciling the various "exciting" sequences with a larger relationship Much with the tickle of developing a plot or character. Unfortunately, the attractiveness of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of fake sexual arousal can neither support nor support this film. The representation is not noticeable, the result is very general though a tendon or interesting stirring. Cinematography is fine, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some very silly sequences using the most distorted lens effects for an eccentric movie in the 1960s of fashion drama. Anyway, the camera script leaves that often live on Artemisia's body, and is rarely painted on its plates. <br /> <br /> We have all told us that they have almost completely failed. Not smart enough to be a serious film, and too slow and ambitious to act as a soft pornography. Even the French can fail, after all!
