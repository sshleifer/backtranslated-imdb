Sorry to beat the flow but I thought this film was unrealistic, boring and very long. Tired of watching a long arduous battle with Gina Rowlands with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. The film may have cinematic value or an important step for the director, but for the value of exclusive entertainment, I wish I had missed it.
