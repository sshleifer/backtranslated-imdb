Unlike the other two offerings of Endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the speed in this display is very slow for what happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 against. 100 can escape the slow speed because the games can be changed - or end - at any moment. There is a risk in every action the player takes, bonuses are very variable, and it is difficult for players to leave large amounts of money. Thrill is usually used. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is very slow. When a question is clearly revealed and the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that nothing exciting will happen at all in the next few minutes. This offer will help to reveal the correct answer first, then make the player choose a dancer, instead of wasting a chat to talk about what will happen if the player made a mistake in answering when we all know he is right. Random dance is actually padding like stuffing. A lot of time is wasted while not enough happens ... The fact that players can not choose to quit the game early ensures that there will be a lot of wasted time. <br /> <br /> Oh, I have no interest in watching Shat shake the thang groove, especially after dinner directly. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong game enthusiast, but even have trouble sitting for an hour of this. Needs either major changes or early retirement.
