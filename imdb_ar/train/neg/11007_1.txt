They recently tried to fix this late-night movie on cable TV ads. Incredible hype. You are one of the unlucky people to see this stinky in the theaters. This, in my opinion, is the worst film of all time, behind Mac & Me (# 1 worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 worst), but I must admit, they are all close and all terrifying! Really, there is nothing funny or annoying in this movie, or anything else claiming to be wasting your money. The only good thing is to give your worst enemy. I do not lie to that. Someone who loves killing or torture will be the first candidate for this film. This is awful. If you do not believe me then you deserve the misery of watching this, which I doubt you can finish. Two thumbs down with enthusiasm.
