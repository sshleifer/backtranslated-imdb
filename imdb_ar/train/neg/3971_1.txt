Give me back my money! Give me my life again! Give me a little credit. This film was worth vomiting. Useless and time-consuming. What a waste of energy and useless. Well, I understand the premise and the voice of the idea, but, give us a break! Next time, just give me money and let me spend it. Lost child, maternal regret, blame husband! Clichy Yes ~! Get a life! Sorry, but this film was a complete waste of my time, money and my being. I prefer watching cooked eggs! There is no real explanation why this happened. the prison? why? Loss? Clear but why? Acting is worth what I'm doing here Oscar and cinematography Do I do this just for pay? How much did this film make? Well this stupid idiot hired a copy. He said enough
