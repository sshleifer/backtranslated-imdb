I remember Ben's mysterious science fiction days in the 1960s. I was interviewing some of the most obscure actors / actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fei Spain and Judy Fair who played Angela in The Young Savages in 1961. Ben One of the people who participated in a low-level science fiction conference in Chicago around 1970, when I had a nice conversation with him and with his "life" and his life. All these things have been published in some supporters who have long forgotten them. I wish I had copies of those interviews, but over time, which of these people certainly will not remember me at all after many years. Ben was a really nice colleague, earning his living (he did not pay the downsides of those days to his guest, unless of course he was an outstanding star, and even after that the salary was a few hundred dollars, at most!) It's good to know that Ben is alive and kicking How to live a new version of the creature, but after 50 years!
