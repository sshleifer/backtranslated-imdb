I'm not sure why Spike Lee broke a movie from this movie and fooled the poor Stevie Wonder to incorporate his beautiful music forever with this playful mess. I am also dissatisfied with the way in which profane words are used as part of the natural prose of professional blacks. Misuse of his grip on ethnic film pioneers is a disgrace. Scenes appear to be contrived in blue and have nothing to do with the subject or subtopics, play as if some college students wrote this. I particularly hate the funny scene where the players compete clumsily for no reason at all and the police come and hard Snipes. Exaggerating potential customers make one feel as if Spike does not respect his viewers or have no idea what the film is about. It seems that the last scene is being put to justify the use of a sledge hammer to touch a point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the word F in a normal conversation. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same group he does not grow up in as a filmmaker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He must commit to documentaries such as four colored little girls. Shock movies do not make Oscar.
