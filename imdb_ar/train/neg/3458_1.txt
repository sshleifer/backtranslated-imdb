Usually I'm not the motivation to write reviews. But this film was very painfully painful I feel I should. I stumbled upon this horrific plot that was predictable, and I gave up lame and laughed at the moments I was supposed to be tense. In fact it seemed that most of the audience feel bored and policing even at the "most tense" moment of the film. Molly Ringwald was characterized as the only performance of any advantage in tormented production. So "twist" in the end was not. I heard that he said the film did not take itself seriously; but I found little evidence of it in the film. <br /> <br /> "Cut" should have been left on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
