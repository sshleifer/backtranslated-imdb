His first film after the death of his old friend John Peloschi, an acrobid shows a lot of exhaustion as he tries to get rid of a personality that could have been a surprise for Biluchi. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film "Doctor Detroit" gives us a written professor of acroids. A violent stranger to ward off a competitor known only as Mom. This is bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, dinner at the school to host, four ladies in the evening for protection and dinner of the pimp (or something like that) to attend. No wonder that Ackroyd seems stupid most of the time. Why should the viewer be lonely? <br /> <br /> Akrid had an interview with Donna Dixon's future wife. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> A half star. You want Aykroyd well, see "The Blues Brothers". Want a bad, see "Detroit Doctor".
