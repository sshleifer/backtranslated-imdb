I really do not understand all of these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst film I've ever seen, and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is spicy but terrible in this film. But I do not think it's her fault but the directors. He somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their representation, the idea, the make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just about the idea behind the movie, which was performed very badly. <br /> <br /> Do not see this nonsense, go to see Fellini, Woody Allen or some of David Lynch.
