She has recently been able to catch up with Marilyn Miller's films due to her lack of exposure to TCM in the UK. I have been fascinated by the years because this was one of the most prominent stars of the 1920s. What did she really love? . For some of the stars in this era like Golson, some magic still shines, but unfortunately does not seem to be Miller. The dance seems to her strange and poorly designed, and her singing is somewhat limited and as an actress make Robbie Keller look like Hepburn. This film, as the audience is fed up with musicals, almost all music numbers were deleted. So we had a comedy in that period with little real impact. I've been paying $ 500,000 for this! So, I have only two conclusions. Either she served well by the cinema or did not have a talent at all. I think the truth is closer than before.
