I do not know why I'm taking the time to review this wasted film. If you committed to it for a long time in the hope of reaching a satisfactory result? Good, bad, or sudden? No. Finally fade away after dialogue and strong and strong representation. The internal scenes are very dark if you think the camera is minimized by one millimeter, you'll see klieg lights. Fashion, hair, collections are starch, pressed, and immaculate. Are we supposed to imagine that ordinary people really did so in the early 20th century in Arizona? Comparisons of the other reviews with Sam Beckenba are an insult to Beckenba: at least this director penned his nose in the context of chaos and chaos. GORD HARD MEN is a ridicule that explodes without justification from the wooden distortions of the wicked with toenails. Huh?!? I think Houston thought it was probably worth something from this film. (Does he hold his gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he was involved in this farce. Do you want to see a film about the end of the West as we know it, and the end of Westerners as we know them? Watch SHOOTIST or unformatted again. The last hard man is the irony of the obituary to the West.
