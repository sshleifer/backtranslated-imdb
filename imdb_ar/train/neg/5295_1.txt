A teenager seems to be committing suicide. He leaves to his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking a lot of questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly handled. For starters, this was done before 1988 - mostly in television films and post-school shows. Apart from some curses and dialogue (and hence PG-13 rating) this adds something new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts to work were really painful to watch. It's good now, but not in 1988. Apart from that, his character was like Slob and was always very dirty and it was hard to build empathy with her. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" mumbled. I could not wait until this thing ended. <br /> <br /> I have mysterious memories of seeing her in a theater in 1988 and I hate her (bombed BADLY). It still looks bad after almost 20 years. The subject deserves to be dealt with but has been better executed (with better representation) in countless films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this one.
