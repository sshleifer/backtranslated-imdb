I have been beautifully photographed and acted ably, in general, but writing is very far-fetched. There are such incredible scenes that there is no joy in seeing. For example, the fact that the little granny has a twin brother, so mixed up that I was touched aloud. It seems that "touch bulb passion" also seems strange. <br /> <br /> I do not know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and want to relax with something nice to look at with some soft comedy scenes, this is a very good movie. There is no great effort by the required viewer. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much better than this.
