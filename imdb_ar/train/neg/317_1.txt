This was the worst film I ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this film. I was on vacation at the time, and I had plenty of time to devote to a delightful movie. The apartment we stayed in had this movie contained in the store - you should get it from a $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this movie does not look like any other film he made. This started with a bad hypothesis and then it got worse. There is nothing so funny about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies, including some of the movies I did not care about. But if you decide to waste your time in this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
