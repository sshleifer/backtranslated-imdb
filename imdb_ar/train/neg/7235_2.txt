Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a group of high-profile actors, can not save this badly written attempt in wartime comedy, because his patented timing has no effect. The plot includes Hollywood star Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to evade military service at the start of World War II, followed by his erroneous recruitment in a confused attempt to try the daughter of a colonel (Dorothy Lamor). Bolton's agent, Lynn Overman and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, walk around with him and the three participate in many festivals about the exercises filmed in the Malibu Hills, California. The Paramount program has been dedicated to this effort. Some of its best specialists have been hired, but the direction from David Butler was usually reliable. It was bad, and it must be attributed to a missing comedy element in the scenario. The shift toward the end of the film to find a chance for the championship by Bolton is still born with a poor trick and camera work in the evidence. Strangely, Lynn Overman gets the best lines and this veteran Mr. of the cynical does well. Dorothy Lamor looks beautiful and behaves well too, and is happy to see and hear Clarence Kolb, like her father, who has a unique voice on the screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this movie, cursed as with a script set error .
