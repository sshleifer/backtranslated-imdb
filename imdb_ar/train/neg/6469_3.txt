When I was younger, I thought that the first film was good in childhood, so I decided to see the film. This is an example of why some films should not have consequences, because the first film is usually better, and it is. Now that Ariel and Eric have married a daughter who is not allowed out of the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the octopus who is full of the first film), Morgana will arrive. When the child comes out, she asks the sister of Ursula to turn her into a mermaid, just like my mother. This makes Ariel return to the sea to find it. The same artists sound good, it's just a story that could have been a bit more thoughtful. Adequate!
