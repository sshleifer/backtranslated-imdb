The Vulpine Massacre These films should have been the actual address. The tag line must have read "Guaranteed to make your children cry!" This is a natural drama that tells the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote area. Ranging from the meeting and the coupling of two small foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and breeding trials for them. It is only spoken in the narrative by a tree standing above the cairns, giving insight into the animals you love and live ... wonderful landscapes and wonderful photography of animals. Sounds good huh? Well, from there, things go straight to hell, and then you start digging into the heart ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - or this may be a warning! *** Almost first we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems to be well in line with a delightfully musical degree to accompany him ... then die ... then we have one of the siblings adventures. Then die ... one of the sisters gets a screen of her time ... then dies ... So it looks like a horrible bitter movie where the fox is killed by nature by nature, in traps, just up and disappear, even by a group of snow! By the end of the film, almost all foxes had been slaughtered. Although it is hoped that no deaths will appear on the screen. (At least not in the version we have seen.) Unlike the words "Tarka the Otter", the deaths in this film are almost meaningless and limits to sadism in the way that hopes accumulate and then grab. One or two losses were acceptable. It's a natural film after all. But not nearly all of the family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this movie, which was deceived by the greeting box to imagine it safe for children. Watch it with some prior knowledge that things will not go well and that you or your children may leave a very bad feeling depending on how sensitive you are or who they are. You may enjoy it. Or may not ...
