The same closet / under bed / person behind you in the mirror repeatedly makes it repetitive and boring, not in a way that foreshadows it too, and the fact that NOBODY never " Really "kills (at least not on the screen), which in turn drains any suspense that may immediately provoke it and makes everyone feel they have been cheated more spending money on their entry ticket .... It is a horror film without any horror. The most you see is that someone seems to have taken a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it on a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> A teenager sitting there must be screaming in the theater and scare yourself to enjoy this, or you are high / drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and do not bother you by writing reviews so I often did not really hate something, or I enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br /> But this movie is awesome and I feel it's my duty to warn you not to make your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of movies again! <br /> <br /> Renting a "bad" movie from Weinsteins is great, and the other is when you have to sit in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want some nostalgia remake, forget it! This is not a remake, nor is it re-imagining. It's not scary, not attractive, nor is it satisfactory enough to be "funny" as others have claimed on IMDb ... It's just something meaningless. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll take from this movie: Remember the scar on top of Brittany Snow that highlights more of the plot, the fact that Jonathan Shash should have a sexual relationship with JS Cardon of "The Forsaken" has got another role As a murderer (because it is scary like a puddle, and very nice in killing almost anyone) and for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of people will not be concerned about a concert when they decide to announce candidates for a concert for the queen, queen and girl who are severely contested and not showing up in one way or another? This is a warning you do not waste money as you did. The "original" also sucks but it is a pleasure to be loved by Jamie Lee Curtis, although there is nowhere near this piece of crap (sorry to look vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what to say) .
