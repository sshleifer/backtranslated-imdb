Another insult and slap in the face of gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend. Again, our "straight" attractive hero assumes that he can not make any woman interested in him. Yes correct! We also made a gay friend "sympathetic and attractive" who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man who is supposed to find attractive lead. So I did not find him attractive and I am a fat man with a fat debt (but fortunately not bald)! Whatever the talent of acting there, it has been cast on bad text, and a truly terrible trend. Mr. Sneedeker must be banned from the film, but it is no different from the countless other breakthroughs that operate in Hollyweed.
