I, too, having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, consider this one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I am dissatisfied with this day and I had to explain my children to my children Russia is not the "bad guys". Also, the mockery of Russian names such as "poopchev" is inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The scene of a very birthday party featured a semi-sexual joke, indicating that males drink beer and that women talk on the phone. Two other flies also use the word "crap" twice unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> 3) The entire film is largely inspired by the stereotypes and propaganda that emerged in 1950 that thought that we as a proud nation had risen above it. In everything that is just raw, the animation is badly, more badly written and not worth wasting time to view.
