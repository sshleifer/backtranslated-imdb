This weekend, I've just watched "28 weeks later" which was very good. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I've told you it's one of the most boring horror you can ever see. The scenes were unrealistic, and there was no scenario or plot. The strange creature was unreal. The scenes of fighting are light compared to the school yard. To make matters worse, the man named Cody had an uncontrollable dirty tongue that distracts attention from the main film. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; go ahead and watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
