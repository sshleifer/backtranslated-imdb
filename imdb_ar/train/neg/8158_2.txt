What is the purpose of creating consequences that have nothing to do with the original film? Useless. That is why the consequences of the night prom are so bad. <br /> <br /> The original film involves a group of children hiding in a dark secret that eventually kills all but one of them in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone explain to me what the dead party will be from the grave to the steel that the crown is associated with the first film after that? Prom Night 2 had continuous slots in the drawing that left the audience constantly wondering how it happened and why it should happen? But in the end, I think you can call it one of those very bad movies, you end up laughing through it.
