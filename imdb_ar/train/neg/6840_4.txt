While this trip certainly does not live up to its predecessors, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My favorite profile, after putting waste in a building in the city with "Videodisc Cannon", we see close-up of Nimoy's face. When one tear is shed from his left eye, we know at that point that Nimoy is more than a killing machine. The viewer can only drift to his emotional turmoil and understand that his flat effect was previously just a facade. Absolute intelligence !!! Sex scenes offer a nice balance, physically, but not pornographic. After that, I felt I understood very well how the Magnavision Videodisc player works. Too bad they have not produced it in more than 25 years.
