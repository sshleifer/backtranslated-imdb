Not funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python? This is very ridiculous - no laughs. This is not funny. On the top, but ugly, just weird for a strange and it seems to me that these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately, nothing has made it funny. <br /> <br /> Some points must be given for effort and so on. In fact there seems to be a laughable track - or is there a pathway? Hummm .... Since there are hardly any laughs, this is a question that is debatable. <br /> <br /> Maybe I do it unfairly - maybe it's a kind of exercise. Kind of art - in this case, everything goes, does not matter. <br /> <br /> But these men play women with high-resolution sounds, and sophisticated noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir to the intellectual intelligence of Monte Python, Stephen Colbert, and perhaps John Stewart.
