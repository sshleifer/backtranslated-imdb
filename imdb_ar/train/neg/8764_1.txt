This film was absolute torture. First of all, it's a huge 4 hours long! It is true that the Kargil war may have several points taken and fought, but it is not necessary to show each of those battles. Perhaps this is a documentary film, not a commercial film as it is advertised. This certainly does not seem to be the case, since insufficient background information was provided and there were some drawbacks. The battle sequence was executed very badly. I am terribly disappointed by the guy who presented a good sequence at the border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. Very expected. (This may be a spoiler). The whole army walks hard, knocks five soldiers or so five thousand times each (they also use the same password each time), one of the main actors is shot, someone yells on a stretcher, and the actor says, "No, no. You get a stretcher, it will take six men from the battalion, "and then a representative dies. This thing exactly happens again and again and again. Oh, the songs are very bad and long. The film crew is too big for him. Despite this long film, none of the characters were developed well. The actress had the most insignificant roles. They all dressed and imagined to be the same. Two of them were crying simultaneously. It was very comedy. They moved their hands and heads exactly at the same time, and then they fixed them together. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyway, I think I've smashed the movie enough to get the picture.
