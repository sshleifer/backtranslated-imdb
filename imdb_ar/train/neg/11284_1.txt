I usually try to criticize good reviews of films, but I can not believe that this has passed the stage of the text. The dialogue is appalling, the representation is very dodgy, the dialects are just awful, and the direction and speed are absent at best. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the last time I saw such a bad film. Joseph Fein, as it is, may have killed his career as quickly as he started. <br /> <br /> The island of Dr. Moro was not worse than this garbage.
