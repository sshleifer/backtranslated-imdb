"I am a comedian!" "You are an example!" What should I mean ?! This plot can not be worse when the boy, who is afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the end of the film because he went to the library. The sole purpose of cellulite wasting is to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more effective means of doing so is a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as the librarian "Expected Page"), can save this futile film from a boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or God of God of Sounds, Frank Welker, because cartoon characters never save them. I can only describe it as being equal to the 1990s, equivalent to the terrible adaptation of 1978 with Water Water Babies, because the fine animation makes the film worse, not improving the boring plot!
