Who is the? What? Where? when? why? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsal. I have seen all the actors in this film in better roles. It was a very elementary script. By the end of this film, the story line has been linked. Claude Lamar's gene must also be linked. So that it never tries to write / eject another movie.
