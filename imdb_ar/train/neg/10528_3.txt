This photo was taken because the music was performed by Hans Zimmer, a Metasonix tuning agent (made by someone dear to me). The artwork says "Version 2003". <br /> <br /> Give it one point for strong females, one point for flashy dialogue and one last point for the light blue eyes, which is a lot of screenshots. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum swimming casually (the pool has a plexiglass window!), while his lover was chasing a lady in Greece. <br /> <br /> The groups were marginally impressive, the rich houses of Los Angeles and the spans, where the castle was. I found myself wondering how they managed to keep cleaning with all the dust blowing. The wind was not fierce enough to be reasonable to me. I kept thinking that animal pellets should be on bad furniture ... etc. I realized that the film should be very boring if you wonder about these things when the supposed plot unfolds. I stumbled into things like why did you set fire to the game and throw it into the fire? Such dumb things. He was high-heeled at best. Oh, okay. Robert Morley got a little fun with his eccentric personality and a nice holiday out of it.
