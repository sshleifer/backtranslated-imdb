The inventor Wayne Rollinski (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his shrinkage / enlargement machine to the Smithsonian Institute as he and his wife Diane (Yves Gordon) prepare for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bog Hall). Wayne Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Alison Mac) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteered to care for Adam while his parents were absent, but as luck would tell him (and the title will lead you to expect), adults are irritated by The error is by shrinking Wayne rays. During the flight of children, their tiny parents must respond to huge, brutal insects and wrinkles in the carpet similar to grooves and other threats to them. This was bad, like most direct videos, dear, we've squeezed ourselves a bit of laughter. I had to laugh at this movie "Roach" Stewart Pankin was the most ridiculous party intimidation, introduced at your own risk!
