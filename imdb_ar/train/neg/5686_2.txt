Hi. This is my first evaluation of any film I've seen. I have encountered a problem in doing this to tell everyone that this is literally the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I feel that the film has been produced easily, and I will give some understanding because of budget constraints on its making. I felt like I was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. What I also agree, the saw is also very graphic, but I like the film saw. <br /> <br /> The scene where the hammer takes the victim's head in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've ever seen. The scene lasted almost forever, in fact, maybe it was about 5 minutes but still. I want to point out that I like some horror movies and give them a credit if they are good. This director is a favorite, and his group of people who make this film should think about it before making another similar film. Last note haha! For all people who enjoy watching animals, they will be horrified, with women and children with a famous sight and five minutes to get someone, where you can enjoy a loud voice with Hummer and enjoy this movie. , Go with a higher budget movie, such as Saw for example. I can not believe that people actually make films like that. Anyway sorry to anyone who likes uwe boll and take it to heart, that's just my opinion in the movie.
