One of the worst movies I have seen is working in a poor camera, using a crappy filter, the movie was popular, the script was terrible, I mean, hey, how could the great battle be foreseen in the end ..... <br /> <br /> Some scenes of fighting They were so good I think .... <br /> <br /> Some scenes were very bad and had a comedy ... like sorbo get horse and rides in the end ... lol I mean really .. horse? I can not forget how the wicked killers roamed the same vehicle throughout the entire film. I think that one of them having seen both the prime witnesses and the federal agents, was tracked down ... etc, ETC does not care to watch him.
