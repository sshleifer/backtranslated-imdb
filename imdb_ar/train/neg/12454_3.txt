I have read posts here regarding the miraculous costume of this TV movie. It should be noted that at the time of making the film, she was not wearing her traditional clothes. Producers were in fact adhering to the comic book concept of World War I in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, I have to agree with many other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he appeared on ABC Channel in 1974, so I was the right age to appreciate a movie about a comic book hero. However, I was immersed in this plot and stopped watching three-quarters of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not in the right age to appreciate Kathy Lee! :-)
