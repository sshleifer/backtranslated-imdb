Well, Jesus Montreal is basically an intelligent film. The actors are really good and the technical aspect of the film is fine. But, although I was very interested in the subject and loved to think about religion and discuss it (I am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the film bitterly and in my opinion funny end unconsciously. Why is this film incredibly boring? I do not know, I do not know. It's just not even recommended.
