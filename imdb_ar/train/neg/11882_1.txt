I passed this on the shelf several times and looked at countless huge positive quotations (with small names) on the front and I wonder if I miss something. The other night she was in a movie channel, and I set her up. Nothing missed me. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I only saw the first 30 minutes. Maybe the movie becomes a golden comedy after that. In the light of the slow pace, the speed of laughter and the total absence of laughter in the first 30 years, I strongly doubt that. <br /> <br /> The lead character of the film begins with a classic "I do not know how to start my film" style, with a long and exhausting monologue about how he does not want to sue. Not funny. It's not funny remotely. Others commented on the bit of San Francisco. Well, a small chuckle the first time he says it. Then grinds it on the floor smiling at the camera as if it is the most beautiful thing written at all. calm yourself. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason I hated the movie right away. Do not assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is _earned_, much like respect. <br /> <br /> From there, you have basically a fat man who speaks in a very chilly manner about his dull life as a temperature. I did not realize that he was a Jew; he defamed Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor." It's just a sense of humor. Just because you are a Jew does not mean that you have a talent in comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, performs a better analytic humor than this man, so it is obviously not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I saw has worked, I may be sticking. But some players are intrigued about how much he likes the names of the women he works with, and then put them on for five long minutes, not making a great film. <br /> <br /> This is a clear attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the Space Office. Do not let yourself become a victim of targeted marketing. Just say no to Haikou Tunnel.
