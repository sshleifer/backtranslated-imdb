No, it's not a horror film ... this film is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent 1927 movie starring a boxer and a woman who comes between them. She likes boxer known as Jack "one round". She loves him until the hero comes. Although she marries a single tour, she has started flirting openly with the hero until the final boxing battle battle between a single tour and a hero. She returned to the One Round corner, when things seemed more gloomy, miraculously finding the inner strength to win the battle and win his wife in love. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in Hitch's history, but time constraints should not make him make a permanent film. Although there are some tricks for the cinema, some relaxation of comedy, however, this film does not withstand any of his subsequent works. You must be very awake for a while though, with a rude shameless wife. Maybe this was a retreat in 1927. While looking at all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they can be rebuilt on today's screen and really come. Maybe I should be the person .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you plan on watching all the Hitchcock movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
