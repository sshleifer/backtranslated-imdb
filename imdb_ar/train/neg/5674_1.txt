My God, what's going on? Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It's good to note that most positive reviews come from beginners to Paul's work. Personally, as I mentioned in the previous Uwe Boll reviews, I only watch his films in the hope that he will do something good someday. I mean, it must happen one day! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the seeds are not on that day. I do not know exactly where to start with a lame attempt at a horror movie Seed. The thing to remember is that all the patients in the world are in this way because of seeing different satisfactions on the video or on the net ..... or so Mr. Paul believes. For the rest of my life, I can not find out why there is a need for footage of animal abuse and murder in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that Seed is sick and enjoys watching such things ..... but I can not understand why Mr. Paul believes that putting REAL footage in the film will work. Perhaps to shock us? Hmmm ..... Well, I'm not bothered and I can handle seeing anything on the film. However, I do not find the use of cruelty shots on real animals entertaining at the very least. If you try to shock me, it does not work. He just reminded me how he messed the world because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This kind of context may have been successful in films in the 1970s (Cannibal Holocaust), but not in today's market. <br /> <br /> However, we can move on to the fact that Uwe managed to give the film a very cheap sensation like BloodRayne 2. You can only say that there was not a huge amount of money going around to produce it. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Paul does not really care to make a decent story as we deal with boring footage of police officers watching different videos of seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends with a quick disassembly of the victim. It's all very boring and boring. I will not comment on the child's scene because it is laughable and another cheap "shock" factor. <br /> <br /> If you can sit in the first 25 minutes, you will be treated to police officers walking in a very dark house to catch the seeds. The lighting here is awesome and Uwe has old "I do not use a static camera" as he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch as police officers die in increasingly stupid ways until this point is discovered. This scene is very stupid with blood you have to see to believe in it. The policeman tells Seed that he can shoot him. For some unknown reason, the policeman does not shoot him. Because the sick seed kills children and adults, I have thought at this point in the text that this meaning will prevail. <br /> <br /> From here we deal with a stupid execution scene, followed by policemen who bury the seeds alive (they know that he is alive ... why not shoot him in the head ????), followed by The seeds come out of the ground and then kill a random woman with a hammer and then kidnap one of the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to get to all of us here is that it's just stupid! It's not even stupid horror Hollywood .... just plain stupid. Uwe Boll can not direct ****. Anyone who has any ounces of taste will agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it entertaining in any way or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again, we are dealing with a weak, directed, lit, productive and written piece of UB crap.
