What?!?? Why do people say this is "mind blowing?" All you have to face is the end of the worst endings in the history of cinema! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention that Person 9 was stupid all the time everyone was killed. 1 was right all the time, if he had sacrificed 9 for otherwise would have happened. People who give life there for a stupid reason and why? ... to make the rain? I admit that the film contains parts, and the whole concept was wonderful. But many of them were cliche one by one. Did anyone else feel that this was much like the Lord of the Rings? The characters died for stupid reasons, there was no evolution of personality, and ask yourself honestly that it is good to have only four men left in the world; useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, thankfully! How robots turn against creative humans in any way! It was done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go watch a movie worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, those good movies!
