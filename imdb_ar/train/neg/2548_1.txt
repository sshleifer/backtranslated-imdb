The fact that this film made it all the way to Rintrak in Norway is strange. This movie is just awful. This image quality is slightly better than the mobile compared to the enterprise, and the picture is very bad. The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just sucked. Everyone who follows this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film put his name on this is unusual. And distributors have seen it? Maybe this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Description This comedy is an insult to humanity. I encourage you not to support this movie by buying it or renting it.
