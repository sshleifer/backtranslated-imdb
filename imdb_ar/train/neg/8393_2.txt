John Carradine, John Ireland, and Faith Dumberg, as players who have seen better days in better films, met with the first-rate horror film about art imitating life in a mysterious palace. <br /> <br /> For Cardin, during these last two decades of his career in theory, it would have been better to continue working no matter what she did and get these salary checks. With this wonderful sound from his voice, Karadin was always in great demand for horror pictures and did not distinguish the man at the very least in what appeared. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of interim leader of an ancient Gothic palace rented by filmmaker John Ireland for his latest low-budget film. So they got a cemetery, but with a missing vacancy. Faith Duke is an aging star in Ireland and Carol Wells is an emerging young woman. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes or so, most of the characters with dead bodies are no longer dead. The scenario is not very coherent I'm still trying to figure out this point. Nothing more gray will be lost on it.
