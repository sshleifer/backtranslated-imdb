This is largely ridiculous, and I hope that many people will be exposed to Muslims living all over the United States, the United States and around the world. Religion has more than a billion followers. I was born and received bread in America and through my religious chapters and teachings, I learned to cherish my country and to contribute to society. I am very devoted to followers and religious teachings have been emphasized through life to educate and prepare themselves for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. I have known a lot of Muslims from all over the world and traveled to countries like Pakistan ... I did not meet someone who believed that we should harm anyone or not accept any religion other than people in the media ... I wonder why ... sad also That these extremists are used by the media to represent a complete religion. It's a religion of a billion people, these are less than one per cent, and I'm sure other people from other religions do not want to be represented by KKK, IRA and many others who represent a small percentage of simple extremists who use outdated rather than passages Literal books of honor to pursue acts of revenge, personal or commercial through the so-called religion
