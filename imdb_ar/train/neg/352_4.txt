It seems that the team must ensure at least an average film. I sat for 102 minutes of no faith. Beside Ed Harris, no one seems to have acting skills. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, must have a whole day during Just Just. One actor can not be persuaded once during the entire film. <br /> <br /> Making this movie seems cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit of a story. It is impressive, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion Watch this movie only if you have nothing more useful to do.
