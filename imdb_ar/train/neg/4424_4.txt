Uh! Another gay movie. This time the black side appears. I bet that another dollar for you will get an unhappy end! but why? Except for less than half a dozen exceptions, all gay films must end with death or "addio". It's like all versions of the European film Noir in the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Lead ... male or female must die or ride alone in oblivion. Why in the name of God should writers, directors and producers be left to the public feel depressed? After all, supposed to be gay ... no gloss. You may need to change the category to the movie "glum". A large proportion of gay and gay relationships continue to ride together at sunset! Regardless of who writes or produces, shows only the negative side of gay life and gives an incorrect impression of the gay lifestyle. This film proves my point only. If you rent a DVD, take an antidepressant because another "weird" movie is coming! This is a mistake!
