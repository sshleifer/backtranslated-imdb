Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican TV every day, at 2:00 am, they broadcast horror movies from the 1970s to early 2000. The film "Return To Cabin By The Lake" was the movie that was shown yesterday. I am sorry to see it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a popular low budget that was well accepted. The problem is that this is a terrible sequel, not so funny and unintentionally trying to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> In some spots, the movie looks like a soap opera because of silly dialogues, cinematography and direction. > My advice is: Avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that should not be seen by anyone. Even for humble filmmakers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
