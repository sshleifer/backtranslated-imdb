Anyone who studied any physics or cognitive science would come out disgusted after 40 minutes, as did my wife and I. The ignorant masses may be tempted by the pretexts of manual renunciation and the absurd "conclusions" (without even trying to rationalize) the real science. I feel insulted by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the book picked up a quantum physics book, did not understand a word, then saw the matrix about a thousand times, and went on writing this film. <br /> <br /> For example, the crime experiment was conducted in Washington, DC, by the Transcendental Meditation program. A brief search will reveal their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
