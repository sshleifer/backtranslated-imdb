THE DECOY is one of those independent products, made by obvious newcomers, but does not have all the usual flaws that sink most of these movies. She has a specific story, has an appropriate representation, very good photography, the hero and the bad guy are both huge men, the background music is not overpriced. This is a new version of the DVD, so people will be looking here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where all ten come from, so there's no good way to film - even if you're the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in the theater was Warner's book on the beloved and beloved JK Rowlings book, The Order of the Phoenix. When comparing the DECOY with Phoenix, think that Phoenix (as Warners did) has no story, and certainly did not allow the director to act, the photography was awful, and the stunning musical result of the sound wall was just chaos. Phoenix is ​​rated as "1" because the scale does not decrease. THE DECOY is the best 4 times - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give DECOY a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If you do not exceed your expectations of the "stupid" 10 result here, you may only enjoy the film on its own terms.
