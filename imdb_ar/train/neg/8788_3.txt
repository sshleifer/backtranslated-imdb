It is shameful that a story of a poem and an attractive compliment can focus on your interest at first, then gradually let you more and more continue until you leave a scratch on your mysterious head by the time it reaches its extreme end. . Unfortunately, that's what happened to me by the end of white noise. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault. It was a pleasure to see him coming back as a star to a completely new film again, he may seem a bit flimsy, but still able to deliver a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife recently died, he became obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea) and seems to have contacted her through this disturbing act of electricity on TV when there is nothing to be broadcast. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​connecting spirits through the air waves (EVP) is called "the phenomenon of electronic sound" and there are many people who actually believe in it, so I will not make any comments about what I think of it, or them. Let me just say that I am all for the suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying movies as wonderful as this, but what I can not afford is a lack of understanding of what was supposed to happen in hell, which is where I was leaving stranded people When the credits finally began to roll. Many realism is fixed. <br /> <br /> Sometimes movies like this make me very puzzled, but if the film fails to explain itself to me, I tend to consider it the director's fault, not mine (unless I see it while I'm tired of concentrating or something What). Well, for the white noise, I was wide awake, the bright standard and tail tail thick - so think of who is to blame?
