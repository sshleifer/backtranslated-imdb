I'm a fan of Stooges, but the only quality of the film is that Curley is there. It was a long time before he drank heavily and he himself was in this (Larry is not bad either). Moe's character is a straight part (often) and this film will be the best "The Corley and Larry Movie". Not that none of the Stooges movies were very good (in my opinion), but as one commentator said here, how sad it is that this film had real potential. The choice was good, well directed, filmed and edited, but the story sought to be around something serious with some exotic of Stooges and musical numbers (which I think were good at the time) were put up. Do it yourself during this movie, if you really think it should be better than cutting the cannabis and getting out the trash (discussion thread) is waiting for the Curley / Larry scenes and sleeping or finding something in the kitchen to eat through the rest of it.
