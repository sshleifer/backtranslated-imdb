Well, so I got to know this movie and I watched the preview almost all the reviews almost and had difficulty discussing whether I should watch it or not. Before I saw the film, I was emotionally alien. I was not sure if I would see this and annoyed me a long time ago. So I chose to risk it and watched it and broadcast what I thought: The beginning started good for me. It seems to be heading in a decent direction. I went beyond the rape scene and could not tell why people were angry or bored with the film. Do not get me, the rape scene was sad and scary, but it did not really bother me much. Then when the middle came, I understood the boring things that were happening. There was like 5 minutes of nothing but people wandering around saying or not showing anything! One thing is to get a shot where someone displays a kind of passion but this film did not have it. She had about 3 of these useless scenes, where you see Maya's main character being a kind of control but she did not show up properly which makes me want to progress quickly. Then, when I got involved in the party, it was not very boring, but it was still somewhat boring. Oh and as a remark Rosario Dawson is doing a great job. Well, you just have to finally move after an hour of messing to the middle. This is where I got worrying. I did not feel bad for him or did not get anything he deserved but the whole scene was really annoying and I felt quite then. I can not really tell you whether to watch this film or not because it does not ... I do not know I can not find a word to sum it up. But if you choose to watch it, do not worry.
