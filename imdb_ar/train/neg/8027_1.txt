I watched this movie. to the end. This was not really easy. It's very boring, poorly played and in almost every detail stolen from the BLAIR WITCH project so you can not believe that manufacturers take this seriously. Hard to believe it, how to make this "product" from putting it on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have fun, watch some kids running around in the forest shouting at each other and showing no Their ability, watching the dark area.
