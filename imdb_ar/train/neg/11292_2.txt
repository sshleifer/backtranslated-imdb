Cornell Wilde and three dumbbells look for the sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Wilde's treasure hunters fight a group of regional sharks with little grunts on their hungry faces. Wilde and his fun men must find a way to get themselves out of the list so that they can start digging an old Galician, full of gold bullion. <br /> <br /> After the crew is engaged in the eternal little to squeeze and push, argue, listen to Wild Health's troublesome tips, 5 crazy dungeons on board and complicate things. It is now a battle of intelligence as to who gets the treasure and who sees how the belly of the shark looks at home. <br /> <br /> Wilde appears to have at least been wearing exactly the same thing that he wore exactly "naked prey" 10 years ago and remained in perfect condition. <br /> <br /> Made with a budget of 75 cents.
