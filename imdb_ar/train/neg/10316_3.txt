To be honest when I first heard this show, although it might be good to introduce a program that makes Muslims use racist jokes on themselves, but that is the exact opposite. I realized that his presentation could help people understand that if a Muslim uses such a word in real life, that does not mean it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotypes. By watching the show, ordinary people will realize that although there may be bad Muslims, that does not mean that we are all bad. Day after day, such as how difficult it was for Amir to ride a plane and how to use words such as "bombing" or Yasser says we will explode the competition, and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that such things do not usually happen, but they do so and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, the wrong things are not. People will see how bad we treat them by watching this show and may make them think about how to behave. I'm glad to view such a came on air. There are many shows that Piotr Muslims are terrorists, many people find them funny to my thoughts, it's okay to do it now and then because everything is made fun of who we say can not make fun of it unfair, but it's done in Often Moslin people really give a bad name.
