The first point that calls attention in "Forever Mozart" is the lack of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there is no story, scenario or plot or anything that may remember the minimal structure of the film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most prolific directors in the film industry, and this is nonsense of his tighter films. I think neither of them understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who are clear to justify or explain this chaotic film, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> One voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Simper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
