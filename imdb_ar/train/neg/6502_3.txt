Given the chance of writing, directing and starring in my own film, I may have chosen something about robot women carrying guns. However, Anthony Hopkins decided to make the strangest movie anyone had ever seen. "Slipstream" is so weird a film that even David Lynch may look at the person next door and say "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> This is a movie where, in one scene, a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing the right that suddenly turns into a rosy car facing left. This is the film where two people talk about a conversation interspersed with footage of people laughing and laughing at insects and climbing walls. This is a film where a man who talks about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" starts just to represent this particular film to suddenly appear himself (and then disappear into the thin air). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent layout straight out of the window and use fifteen different adjustments while doing so, as well as changing from black and white to color without apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I should, however, commend Mr. Hopkins for selecting actors in this film (some of them portraying multiple personalities). All involved throw themselves into their roles, even if they have no idea what they are already doing. My favorite here was to bully Christian Slater in a hat that was impressively threatening while nonsense and singing the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted as saying that he made the film as a joke, and this may be the best way to sum up Slipstream. It's a joke to the public. You will see it from start to finish, trying to understand what is going on in the hope that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer is not actually doing it. What lies in this particular joke is that Anthony Hopkins is the only one who will ever know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I am a big fan of this particular director. I think Anthony Hopkins shares my love for the likes of Peak Peaks, Velvet Blue and Lost Highway. However, the "Slipstream" is not as satisfactory as any of the Lynch films despite the tradition of many of his techniques (although I was surprised to discover that no one is talking back in "Slipstream"). It's very messy and random - as another reviewer has pointed out here, it's a film for Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that a small number are able to see this and extract something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly became a troubling and confusing experience only because of Hopkins' involvement. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
