I think Shakespeare made it clear what I just read beautifully. I think he (the lady) protests a lot. Everything seemed to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He has written down lousy literature (writings from the same period but not related to the Bible) several times, yet I can think of at least three references from the top of my head that provide the historical accuracy of events in the Bible. Anyone can distort data and prove anything they like but that does not make it real. Customs change, and word definitions change over time (see English and German where it is obviously a common root). Nothing stays the same, it always grows and changes. The Bible contains many different translations but it is the King James version that I found best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice that some words are in italics. These words were added by translators and can be dropped and average changes to the entire verse. I wrote writings from the time of Christ almost without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without digital verses. These writings look like a long word and the translators added all of the above. For example, how do you read this: GODISNOWHERE Have you read it because God is not anywhere or do you read it as God is here now? The same string of letters has quite different meanings. This is why many biblical scholars use the "lexicon" to help them with translation because it provides a word for translating words from Arabic or Greek or native Hebrew depending on the language in which the Bible was originally written. It is also important to note that when you translate into a symbolic logic, you can prove the existence of God, but you can not prove that it does not exist! In the end, I like to listen to people who think they are so intelligent that they are qualified to judge God. Talking about the ego! Put the soap away, God bless in Maegi
