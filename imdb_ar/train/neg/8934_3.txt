I purchased this DVD without any previous reference, but the names John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett are on the cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch it and I expected to see a funny comedy like "Switch". However, the illogical story is frightening and difficult to describe. Miron Breckenridge (Rex Reid) is being offered a sex change surgery in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood to tell her that she will become Mira Breckenridge (Raquel Welch) and claims half the ownership of his uncle Buck Lunner (John Houston). Over the years, Mirra and her half-husband Myron spoil a young couple at her uncle's Academy of Strange Sex. At one point, the disconcerting scenario is so confused that I think the whole story was just a mental trip to Myron caused by the accident. Unfortunately, the benefits of Raquel Welch and Farah Fawcett are not enough to keep this. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and Woman to Point")
