As a film critic for many Dutch websites, I have to see a lot of films, not all of them good. Some movies are too bad, you will not be surprised to be released directly on the video. With taboos, I was surprised to be released on video at all. This is really low quality bad budget bad written garbage. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a game of taboo. Write their wish or their most disturbing actions, and then kill people for taboo. The question is, do we have to believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing plot story, and I will not abandon it here. But what could have been interesting, stupid and ill-behaved for no reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have played in bigger titles before, so why did they take part in this on the ground? If you see this anywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this film.
