I caught this a few months ago on the family channel, and after I got some memories of the TV show from my youth, I decided to watch it with my 4 year old daughter. I had to get some narcotic mushrooms to go along with him, because that's just weird! Not only is he a musician with forgetful tunes, the desired cheeses and bustling stars that have long outgrown his collective primaries, but seem to have been produced as a good acid journey for someone. Speaking of Psalms, British children are very old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What are you on?" If you are a fan of the entire Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre community, look for it; otherwise, unless you are ready to get episodes before watching, stay away, away, away.
