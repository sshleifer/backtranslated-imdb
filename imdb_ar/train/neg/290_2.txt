Killer Tomatoes have this kind of humor - either you like it or hate it. I personally loved it, but in this fourth film went feeling. Tomatoes are not the same, lame jokes, so the actors are not funny. Because this is the only thing that is supposed to be this kind of movies - funny. <br /> <br /> So following the plot designed for laughter now is annoying. In fact, they did not have to do the fourth part of Killer Tomatoes.
