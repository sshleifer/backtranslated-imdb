I usually go to this website before going to the cinema, as I like to see what others think in the film. I read several reviews that said "thriller movie is not a horror film." This prompted me to experience this film. I really must have a problem with these "sensational / terrifying" statements, because they were not! I almost went and asked for my money back and if I enjoyed a lot of reviewers this trash .... well, you should be easily pleased! At the end of the film, the people who were behind me said loudly "What a waste of time" and turned to them and replied "I could not sum it up better." I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it did not happen. There was a possibility of many good fears (or excitement if you wanted) but nothing happened. Williams behaved very well but I felt he had been briefly changed by a weak script that did not change. Save your money, this is a turkey that will be displayed in the "bargain box" in the DVD shop near you in the very foreseeable future!
