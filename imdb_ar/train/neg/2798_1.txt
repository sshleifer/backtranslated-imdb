This movie is bad if you're thinking of watching it, there's one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Caraway's naked scene). The rest of the film is terrible. I think high school plays may have a better representation. The plot is meaningless at all. The group was fairly lame, and it was not so good to make fun of them. It was just too boring and too bad! I saw this on STARS so I thought it should be at least fit. The mini description looked like it would be fine. The same friend kills herself for no reason at the beginning of the film, having to watch some dreadful videos. The transitions between the scenes are very surprising as if someone put a lot of clips in a movie without thinking about how to move them. Just cuts from one scene to another, no softness. It is somewhat like my random shift from talking about how bad the film is, to explain why the plot sucks. The sound drops at some points, where you can hardly hear it, and then sounds louder with the "scream of horror" that is thrown at random points in the film. It is the same sound every time. This is now the worst movie I have ever seen <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000 , 000/10
