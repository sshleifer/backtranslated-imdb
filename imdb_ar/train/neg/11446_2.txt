My family and I checked the underdog the night before. Like the badness of Underdog (I love my four-year-old), Hot Rod makes it look like an Oscar-worthy substance. The only thing that could have saved this film, had If Evel himself retired from the slap of Samberg in his face to make this film. However, I will admit that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the film was introduced in the 1980s, but with the majority of music coming from Europe? Who do you know? If I were you, I would pass. Just stay home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you are dead to watch this, people may enjoy it under the influence.
