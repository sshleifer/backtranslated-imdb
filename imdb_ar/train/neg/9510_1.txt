Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film tries to cross, bring and run Heaters. When I saw this last January, I felt so disgusted by the film that I walked and talked to my girlfriend on my cell phone in the last half of the film. I've heard that the DVD has a director's output, maybe I'll review it, but PG-13 is the worst kind of movie. Maybe if the film had some T & A it would make it okay. But the lame gags and the representation is horrible. Worst movie of Troma.
