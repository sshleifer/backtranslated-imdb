The cast is well wasted in this slower than molasses and comedy connived randomly. Peter Ustinov here tries to bring something to life, but the result is a deep cavity that lacks all the correct tones that may have made it possible to see it. Regardless of the positive comments here, this film is very bad. Badly oriented. Bad editing. I behaved badly. Poorly written. You have to sit through a hundred movies to encounter one of these bad movies. <br /> <br /> The miserable and backward conspiracy about Ostinov is on his way to an American insurance company to hack into his computer and embezzle millions of pounds. . What he does is beyond laziness and credibility (he only learns his computer skills overnight by reading some pamphlets, computer expert deception Robert Murley to go to South America and steal his identity). <br /> <br /> Side plot, Austinov's romantic colleague The only player Maggie Smith, who happened to be his secretary by accident after he got an apartment in her building. She ended up sharing sex-tinted scenes with Bob Newhart not going anywhere, while Ostinov continues to raise money slowly and trying to maintain his lead on Newhart and Karl Malden. Marith Smith then marries and flies to Brazil, which has become the basic end of almost every Canadian comedy since (nuns while jogging? A fish called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The sudden surprise of an end is more than laughter from everything that comes from Before. By the end I was thinking that I should be out of the rock really to get rid of this leadership. Even the engraving of Cesar Romero did not help. One of the most unusual "comedy" of the bad pace that I have seen in my life, and certainly the worst. do not waste your time. If you like this, you need to watch better movies.
