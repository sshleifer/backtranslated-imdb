Despite the rave reviews this New Zealand has received, any noise surrounding the production is unfortunately unfortunate. Apart from plot cliches only, the film weakens through some weak plays, accents, and lack of tension in general. <br /> <br /> While enjoying the general appearance of a large budget (against NZ), the feeling is Kiwi is definitely a small town ... <br /> <br /> No one has seen the Brotherhood ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who will choose the similarities immediately ... I have heard comments that viewers like boys playing basketball etc. were launched to mock the "boys who talk" crap " , But they seem to have been forced ... <br /> <br /> I think Oscar Keithly thinks it's very ridiculous, but again his delivery seems to be just a vague self-awareness. <br /> <br /> Those who Have left no doubt whatsoever that the culture of Samoan living in New Zealand has been deeply affected, and we hope not always, influenced by American discourse and culture, and everything will definitely happen in their minds This movie. <br /> <br /> Robbie magasiva always looks good on the screen, but is dropped by the script. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me in the wrong way when "comedy" You know that you feel well in the vulgar manuscripts - see I want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this move hilarious - anyway, this person has the brains of the tadpole, He will struggle to clarify her name if you offer him a million dollars. <br /> <br /> This kinda summarizes the mentality of this flick, okay but not wonderful and fun but not funny ..... Wake up to Newsy Lendy - this is not a 5-star film despite all the glamor (middle-class white guilt? :-)) Reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? If you watch it, drunk first!
