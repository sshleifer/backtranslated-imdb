This movie should not be classified as a movie. Although she is now more than 10 years old, she should never get funding and is an imprint in the Australian film industry, which now produces great films like "The Dish" <br /> <br /> The Actors can not act, music is ... to be sharp, not music, and the narrative of the story is completely absent, a struggle to sit in. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie. It's a complete waste of your time.
