This is a Western business. James Stewart is lead by a star-studded representative in the scenic northwestern region, which was filmed in magnificent splendor. The scenery and the costumes are wonderful. There is movement and adventure. Stewart plays the role of a wealthy cleric who runs across a twisted government in the northwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the typical irony that Hollywood has always made. Even when this film was produced, the sarcophagus was a stereotypical hero, and a Stuart painting that contained very few graces. He is nice with his partners, and this gives him an extra dimension of credibility and probabilities. <br /> <br /> However, it is very sensitive to anyone else, and it is difficult to really care about it, or accept it very much like Western Spaghetti figures of one dimensions (do not break this bad). <br /> <br /> However, the small characters are very fun. Walter Brennan, Ronald Dano, Harry Morgan and other things worth watching.
