Comment "eliz7212-1" hits the example of "nail on the head" for this Turkey of the program. But it is hard to see "William Schattner", "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "marks" on the dance word are necessary for what Bell does). This show will be a wonderful comic play on the SNL or MAD TV - a few stars are estimated to watch one, or so, to see Schattner, who seems to be taking a "camp" to new heights - both in role and as an idiot. But the man is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls in the hula areas with passing game data will be very lucky when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-au-ju-fair, with the revival of demand for young women Who dance in high cages again. <br /> <br /> I saw the first racer, who was annoying, and literally "dumber than: another," yet through sheer luck, he walked away with a quarter of a mile or so. The second rider, the most intelligent one, but who will be lucky to get $ 1000 on Jeopardy! , Had been upset by the card that required the answer to a special question - he did not know him, and therefore left unchecked. <br /> <br /> It is recognized that the sheer number of games that are dangling, sometimes giving large amounts to ordinary people, is generally a cheap effort to try to attract viewers. Even if the host has received a good compensation and they have provided six numbers in a medium loop, I assume that revenue for costs can be favorable - since you do not have a comedic band where many stars get six or seven numbers, per episode, with some deals The remaining large also. <br /> <br /> But I think even the best ones will be worn out for a long time. This one has already pretty much reached this point. I think his performances, especially with James Spader, and others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying amount of Bill Shatner's offerings. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is simply appropriate for displaying Bill Hoot and Prince, perhaps once; it should be enough.
