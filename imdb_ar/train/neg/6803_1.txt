When I get IMDb boards, I'm always fed up when I see the publication "The Worst Movie Ever". After watching this movie *, I think I will soon create my own publication !! <br /> <br /> Opening titles: Magnificent, kind of lame gas oven magnifier (yes, focus on fire = bangs = wonderful movie packed !!) <br /> <br /> Actors: I think Ice T is The great rapper, so he is a nice actor (sometimes, insisted, "sometimes") but Steven Segal like the policeman he plays ... goes beyond words. The rest of the crew ... well, I do not know where these actors were appointed but jeez !! I bet that my dog ​​would have been the best representative of them !! <br /> <br /> Plot: Hijacking.original Is not it? <br /> <br /> Sequence of events: The first shot of the film is an explosion. I said to myself, well, wonderful! At least there will be some nice fireworks .. I was wrong. The remaining part of the film has been filled with low-rent shoots taken from the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> Fun dialogues, pure nonsense music and happy ending (I mean I was finally happy because the movie was over !!!) > My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted (I am 22 years old, 42 years old ...) was about to take the film and burn it. Maybe next time I'll watch it ... (Who never said ???)
