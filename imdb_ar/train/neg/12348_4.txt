This movie is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that dancing flick with Jennifer Bills. Maybe this movie is the most boring film I've ever seen because it's not so bad to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than this film, but that does not mean much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is upscale music and we see her fight and everything, but she is definitely not very attractive. I really think the idea behind the film is interesting, but the script is very revealing and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
