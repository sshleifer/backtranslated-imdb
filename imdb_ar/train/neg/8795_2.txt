I have seen almost no substituting qualities in this film. The only thing I saw was the obsession of Quentin Tarantino, his madman ... There were some attractive women in this film, and perhaps that was decent quality. Overall however, this film found surreal and ridiculous. The hand that made a film accompanied by slow motion and other cinematic tricks found it stupid, amazing, and even deadly. In general, the music throughout was terrible and repetitive to the extreme and reminds me also of the psychological warfare of the US military against many grumbling. <br /> <br /> The various short essays that make up the film are randomized in their placement, non-fulfillment, and unresolved content and "conclusions". A bleak film (not a real film, a term I book for real art) left me feeling bad. The different people who try this film as a "romantic comedy" do not believe that although there are isolated elements in this film, the content, form and result of the film evade any association with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggested staying away despite apparently overwhelming positive opinions for IMDb and the sources of other ratings.
