Spoilers forward, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a full-featured movie review? Can you have this? Why ancient civilization buried antiques around the world? Why was this question not answered? Why was the opening text incoherent? Why do you nun (it sure looks nice!) Handing over 20 orphans to a crazy man? Was there always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine columns go out in the front yard of orphans? Why does the character of Tara Reid suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did you just answer my question?) Why should the non-archaeological archaeologist open a gold box of clear value with a heavy hammer? Why are modern computers still showing the outlines of green bodies dating back to the pre-Tron era, complemented with "little blood"? Should all explosive film timers contain digital screens? Why is there nothing in this logical film?
