This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also features the delightful Larry Miller in a very small part. Despite this I found it almost inaccessible. Michelle Monaghan may be beautiful but free from charisma, and the reasons for her personal obsession with her character are not at all understandable in terms of the information presented by the film or the way it is filmed. The end seems to be pampered, and although the intention seems to be that the public must join the gesture and wink the film, where we failed to bring us along with its heroes, we did not want to or could not do so. <br /> <br /> Film lovers say that those who simply disagree "do not get it." I do not think that is the case. The plot was not complicated or understood. He was simply not involved and manufactured in a clumsy and clear manner. "I Went Down", Paddy Breathnach, "Snatch", Guy Ritchie, "Lock, Stock and Two Barrels of Smoking" are two examples that better understand the type of filmmaking that director Sean Black failed to achieve. . <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Black Shane, but looking at his credits (mostly as a screenwriter) makes me want to break out of any other connection.
