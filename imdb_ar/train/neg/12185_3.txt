What did Martin Scorsese take to remake this film? Not only was it remade, it was completely destroyed? The senseless decision to make the character played by Robert de Niro (in his excessive performance, which says so much) in religious fanaticism is ridiculous, and an ideal example of the attitudes taken by Hollywood (and Mr. Scorsese in particular) - positions that force the book to think of The best way to make a crazy figure is to tattoo on the back. In any case, this movie is awful. <br /> <br />
