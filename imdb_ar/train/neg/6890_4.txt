Except John Hydr. This man carried the entire film. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed amusing. The son of a 29-year-old Heder still lives with the mother of a widow, Kaiton, where he encounters a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son feels jealous and worried about losing his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Fares). <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Knight, but whoever casts a present would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. The performance of the Heders annoying, which would be a good thing because it plays the role of an annoying man, the problem is that it misrepresents the actor to lose this act, making this person finally loved. In the end, I still wish you could hit the guy in your face and you're upset at the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will not be useful to me!
