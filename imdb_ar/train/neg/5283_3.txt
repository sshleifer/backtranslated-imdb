I was eagerly awaiting the premiere of this film since it was introduced to me on DVD on Christmas. After keeping a private slot for her last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (17 years old and a film student), with chocolate of course, in anticipation. We love Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> After only the first two minutes we knew we had sunk. The camera's fragile shots and angles, poor public cinematography, direction, and wood performances have left us feeling satisfied and uncomfortable. We looked despair. <br /> <br /> Ann, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strangely and without any particular purpose directly into the camera on several occasions, breaking our "hard-to-grasp" current imagination and pulling us directly in a way that would almost "find you" chasing fashion. <br /> <br /> The poor Robert Robert Penry, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the text and direction, and blessed him. However, I hope they have paid him well, because he sank practically one time because of a huge wave expected to have broken the sea wall, and he and his co-star are exasperated. They almost swept the sea. Health and safety could have been field day! Poor Robert left spitting out of the sea to deliver his plan. Supposedly there was not enough money in kitty to re-shoot from this scene. No one was in any way not trying to do on such a day in the first place. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige made the only convincing performance like Lady Russell but soon faced her balancing efforts with the unconvincing images of Anthony Head of Sir Elliot Elliot. <br /> <br /> Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared to grace Anne with strange visits every visit that took her great pains to avoid her for the majority of the film. It was as if he had developed an obstacle in memory that made him forget the reason for his existence. By contrast, Anne, who is over-ventilated, ran from one column to another in search of the good captain who, in the meantime, managed to summon the whole Bath to tell us, in just three or four minutes, without even sweating. <br /> <br /> We have not experienced any of Ann's magic crossing the screen. In fact, we have left to wonder what Captain Wentworth, who had a charismatic personality at the time, was neither ordinary nor opinionated, and why no one, Sir Sir Walter, said to close the surveillance. <br /> <br /> A painful kiss was a crucial kiss, and usually we have my favorite girls moment. As she moved closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth that had an impact on the screen to make her look like she chewed gum before the lips finally met. EWW! <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing last night was the chocolate and the half-hour views exchanged between the mother and her daughter about how bad the film was. <br /> <br /> Such a charming and attractive story, which was filmed in some of the best landscapes in England, has been destroyed. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
