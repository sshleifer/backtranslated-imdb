You kidding this was fantastic !!! <br /> <br /> But despite that I got this movie and 3 others and they were all on DVD. The film starts from a fairly good film but turns down from the middle onwards. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, let's say it was one of the most anti-climate extremes in modern movie history. Lots of bull in the final sequence and if you like the dose of horror schlock this is the right movie for you .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
