Watching this movie was a waste of time. My departure was enticed in the middle of the film, but I resisted it. I do not know what Ridley Scott meant, but I knew that in the army, women were as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in the fighting, and this is also a waste of time (in my opinion). In any case, what the hell was this last scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamists are always dangerous?
