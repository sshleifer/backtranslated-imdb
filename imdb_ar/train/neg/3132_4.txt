I did not see a great rating on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway, because I'm very impressed with the material related to the Bible. My first irritation was Indiana Jones' wannabe film, but it also seems that Caspar van Dyan did not watch these Jones movies (but he should). I think he did his best, but the text is difficult. I tried music to be kinda like Jones too. Great work, but for this film, it seemed like a lot of work, like the video part does not deserve all this wonderful music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script ruined everything. "Jokes" is an old school, 20 years old; they just brought a sarcastic smile to my face. There are some really bad camera Angels, SFX looks homemade and unrealistic. Kevin Fannock may have had a good idea of ​​the story (in my opinion, but I like these stories), but things did not work out in the end. Maybe he should put it on paper when it was still alive in his head. When I saw (in the first minutes) that the film would be one of the "low-budget films," I hoped to hear a good "story" at least, but sometimes the movies disappointed.
