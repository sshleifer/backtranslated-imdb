As I sat down to this televised badness, I wondered why? Why did Diane Keaton agree to this litter? The film uses meaningless plot lines to deliver garbage to thousands of homes. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film was meaningless, and all credibility was lost because of the excessive use of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Keaton obviously tried to make this film worthwhile, but in the end you need to remember the old adage that you can not polish. I hope you did not miss New Year's Day watching another senseless movie made in a TV movie. I now know why networks began to broadcast series Sunday night, to rid us of garbage!
