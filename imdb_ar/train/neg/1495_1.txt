I have been watching horror movies since I was five, starting from Childs Place. Since then, I watched horror movies good and bad, but this is undoubtedly the film "Dombast" that I have ever seen! Representatives made their best efforts with the materials. The plot was just stupid. Plus, it was just everything. I can carry a lot of blood, but that was ridiculous! In one scene, a character is stabbed at the back end and choked with his bowels! Easy stupid! Another problem in this film is that the boring movie is probably the slowest film ever made. The end of it is just stupid. But again, the rest goes! In the end, when the girl escape from cannibals / Grandpa, you receive help from an old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns to talk with the girl, the girl attacking! I've turned into a cannibal! Movie Retarded.
